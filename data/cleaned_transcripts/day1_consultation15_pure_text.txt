OK, alright. Um , I know it's a long time ago, but do you remember how it all started? what were you doing at the time when it all started? Is it anything you may have done, to bring your symptoms on? Uh, I mean I am a, I do work as a housekeeper. Um And to be honest, I'm not always very good about wearing gloves. So that could be related. Um, I switched jobs, uh four months ago. Uh OK. OK. OK. I've been working for, as a housekeeper for, for a while now, but um, that's the only thing I can think of.

I tried uh E forty five. Any luck with that? Yeah, no it didn't really do anything. No, OK. Alright. Um I also tried an antihistamine, antihistamine. Uh but it didn't . OK, alright. Um, Mrs. Parkinson, so I think um, based on your story, I I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis. Which is very common in, particularly people in your in your in your field, who are using cleaning products, not using gloves. And sometimes you get a bit of reaction between the chemicals and your skin. Um, so moving forward there's a couple of options. So firstly, what we try and do is, you know, avoid the triggers. In your case, I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times. Yeah. OK. And in terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin, um we can try some steroid creams to help with the inflammation. Yeah. As well as some stronger emollients, um which you really need to kind of coat on, three four times a day, for the next couple of weeks, just to help with the moisturizing of your skin. Um if it still hasn't got better in about a week, two weeks time, I really need you to come back and see me again. And we can maybe think about other things we can give to you. OK. Is that all clear? Uh yeah, that sounds good. Great. Do you have any questions for me? Um, where do I get the medicine from? I'll I'll I'll do a prescription for you now, and send it over to your pharmacy. OK great. Yeah, uh so you said a couple of weeks, it should get better, right? OK. I think I think minimum couple of weeks. Uh ten days to fourteen days. Um and if it still hasn't got better, or indeed if it's getting worse, like if it's spreading, or dryness is getting worse, come back and see me sooner. OK. Great. Thank you Laura. Thank you. Alright. Thank you very much. . Bye bye now. Bye.
