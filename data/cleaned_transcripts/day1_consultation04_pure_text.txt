Um tell me a bit more about that, if you can. Um ,so I, I , you know I think I, it all started with, uh, this colleague of mine, she just kept sneezing next to me, all the time.

Yeah, I, I think um, one of my uh, great grandads had an eczema. Excellent, OK. OK. Um just moving on to what we social history, just to get to know you a bit more as a person. Tell me, who do you live with at home? Ohh um, I live alone. OK. And you said you're working at the moment? Yeah, yeah. What do you do for work? I'm an, I'm an accountant. OK, and how's your work going at the moment? Uh over the last, has it, has it been affecting your work? Um, a little bit. I've been a bit slower. And you know, it's uh, it's, it's a bit of a stressful period just around the um, end of the year. Right. Mm, OK. Is that stress, is that affecting your um, your mood at all any, in any way? Um, no I think I think it's, it's the, you know it's the good kind of stress. It's um, it's good work. OK. Well if there's anything you want to talk to me about, you can always come see me about your mood, um stress, anxiety. happy to help. I don't know. I, I like my job. It's just you know, it's a bit more work than usual. OK. OK. And just very briefly, just in terms of smoking uh, do you smoke at all? Um, yeah occasionally, you know, cigars and things on company parties. OK so not, not regular. Um and what about alcohol? No. Um, occasionally yeah I would have some. I'm, I'm not a very big drinker. socially with work. Yeah. Um OK. Um so um just having listened to your story, um uh really just to summarize you know since the last four days you've been feeling generally quite unwell, sore throat, runny nose, bit of a dry cough, bit of muscle pain, weakness. Um had initial fever, but now settled. Um I don't think there's a lot to worry about. I think you probably have, you know a bit of a viral, what we say viral illness, maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection, or maybe early signs of a flu. Um these normally last about seven to days and just gets better really, um over time. But things you can do to really help yourself, um is get plenty of rest. I'd probably advise you taking a day or two off work if you can. Um Making yourself, pushing fluids and make yourself well-hydrated. Continue with the regular Paracetamol, Ibuprofen. Um and and you should see how things go, really. Um if next week you're still not better, I'd like you to come back and see me. Um is that clear? Does that, does that make, does that make Yeah, yeah, that's that's , it makes sense. Uh, I think I'll take a couple days off, and see how it goes. Yeah, yeah. and things to look out for if you're really not getting better, if you if you have a high fever, or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored, or chest pain, I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner, give me a call. Um and we can help you out. OK? Yeah. Yeah, yeah I understand. Uh, I'll uh, I'll take care. Great. Have a great day. Good luck with your work. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye. Thank you. Thank you. You too. Bye bye.
