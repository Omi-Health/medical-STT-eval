Um fine. uh Robert um having listened to your story, I think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis, uh which essentially is just a, a tummy bug. It's an infection of your, your tummy. Um and normally lasts about three to five days, and gets better. OK. All right. the things you can do to really help yourself get better soon, um are you can drink plenty of fluids. Really try and flush the toxins out of your body. OK. Uh you can get things from the pharmacy, which is called Dioralyte, which can help replenish any uh minerals and vitamins you may have lost. Uh, it's called Dioralyte. Um it's, it's a, it's a type of fluid replacement drink. I'm sorry, what's the name of that? Um, you can take some Paracetamol if you're feeling feverish and weak. All right. I would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for next day or two, until you get better. normally you have to be diarrhea-free for about twenty four to forty eight hours, before you return back to work. OK. Um, let's see how the next few days go. And if you're still not better next week, I want you to come back and see me. And we can have another look at your symptoms, OK? That sounds good, that sounds good. Uh, thanks so much. Thanks. do you have any questions for me, or? Um, no I think that's fine. Uh, yeah I'll, I'll try to , and drink , drink plenty of fluid and I hope it go away. Uh, if it doesn't I'll uh, I'll call, I'll call back. Is that OK? I really hope you get better soon. Thanks a lot. Thanks so much, for your time. OK. Bye bye. OK. Bye.
