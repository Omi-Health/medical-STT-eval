A little bit of spotting, possibly before um, in-between periods, or recently. Yeah, and the last kind of week or so, yeah, the last couple of days really. But, because I was due on.

And I'm nauseous, hot, sweaty, feeling, I'm not really sure. Mmm. I, yeah, why it's happening, um. the last couple of days, that's probably all that's. yeah. Any. Yeah, it's getting uncomfortable. Yeah. Anything that you'd hoped, particularly, to get out of having this consultation? Anything , sorry? was there anything that you'd hoped to, get out of having this specific consultation?

Get to normal, yeah. but a bit more . Yeah, sure, sure. OK, um, so, and then finally. I, I didn't ask you, do you have any discharge, or anything like that, from down below? Uh, no, no, no discharge. No discharge. OK. All right. So, um, I , I, I think, uh. This could be a few different things. It could just be simple constipation. Uh, you mentioned that you were bunged up, but you did go yesterday. So it's, um, and your, your bowel habits, that you've been going regularly. Uh, but you did mention that you were bunged up. Um, but there could be a few other things going on. I would quite like to, uh, see you to do some further, to do an examination, and to do some, some tests as well. Um, we need to definitely rule out pregnancy, with you. And possibly, um, do some other examinations or, or further tests. So, would you be happy to actually see a GP face-to-face, um, soon? Today, ideally. Yes, yeah. Yeah? Sure, I can make time. Are you, and you're feeling hot, hot and, sweaty. Have you been feeling, um, light-headed at all? Or like you're going to faint? No, no, not like I'm gonna faint. OK. Right well, we're just sort of, timing out, running out of time a little bit. But, um, I'd really like to see you, uh, for some more, uh, examination, investigations. If in the meantime um, between now and, and me, sort or a GP seeing you, you feel worse in any way, you get light-headed. Um, you, uh, uh you have, you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you. Um, then I think you should take them quite seriously, and, and see somebody more urgently if possible. Um, OK. Is that, uh, , was there anything else that you wanna talk about right now? I'm glad we got the ball rolling with this, and uh, we can , um, sort of see you again, to take this a little bit further. Mm-hmm. OK. Yeah, thank you, really appreciate that. OK. All right. Thanks for your time. OK. cheers, bye. Thanks, bye.
