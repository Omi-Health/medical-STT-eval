Um, do you have any other illnesses at all? Um, I've, well I've got kind of, been told I have polyps in my nose in the past and, occasionally get them kind of . Um, that, that's all fine and, you know I take a Rennie's if I need to, and if my nose polyps are playing up I've got a spray. Um. Other than that I think they said, ages ago, I had something called, can't quite remember but, labyrinthitis, something like that, but again, nothing, nothing ongoing. Sure. Sure, OK. So, are you on any regular medication? You mentioned the spray for your nose. Yeah, so, no, uh, I only take the, spray for my nose when I need it for, and um, sometimes take like Rennies, but I just get that from the chemist. Sure. and, and the spray for your nose, where do you get that from? Is that from a doctor? Uh, yeah, they gave me a prescription ages ago. Yeah. Do you remember the name of the spray, at all? Unfortunately I don't, sorry. that's alright. That's alright. Uh, and you're not on any other medication at all? No. No, OK. Do you have any , any allergies to any medication? Uh, no just Latex. Latex, OK. Alright, that's good to know. Um, and um, in terms of your family, are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all? My brother had, Neurofibromatosis, I think it is. Um, other than that everyone else is OK. Right, OK. OK, good. That's good. Um, and in, in terms of your own kind of background now, are you, are you working at the moment? Yeah, so I'm a, I'm a jockey, um, but, because of all the kind of, these symptoms I've been getting, especially sometimes when I get a ringing, I can feel a bit dizzy. Ohh, I've just had to do far less training. So, kind of beginning to, yeah, impacting work, um, a little bit now. OK. So you have to excuse my ignorance, you mean, jockey like with horses? Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Alright, OK. Fine. Um, great. Um, uh, and, uh, do you live alone? Yeah, yeah. Um, I, uh, live with my partner. Uh, OK. Right, um, do you have any pets at all at home? No, no pets. OK, fine. OK so, alright. Um, Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what's been going on, recently? Uh, no, just like, like I said, like the ringing um, occasionally and, when I get that I can sometimes feel a bit dizzy but, the main thing is really the, lack of hearing, and the numbness that's got me like, yeah, no idea what's going on there. OK, fine. Alright. Um, So, , what I think , go on. I mean, there was just like, there was one thing I think just, 'cause I can panic and you can look online, get a bit, frantic. , I guess what I'm trying to think is, you know, is there something particularly serious that, you know, will need to be sorted and. Obviously, really, anything can just make you really frantic . Hopefully nothing , so serious I will die from it, I don't know I just, I think got myself in a pickle. OK. so um, uh, obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via the video, uh, portal. Mmm. um, from what you've told me, this doesn't seem to be you know, anything um, that you're gonna die from. However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today. OK. OK? I ,would like you to come to one of my clinics. I would like a GP to assess you. what you're, what you're describing might be something called Bell's Palsy. OK? Um, OK. Yeah. We can go into that, explaining what that is, if um, if that's confirmed on, on physical examination. But um, that's not usually a life-threatening problem. OK. But, um, part of the reason why I'd like you to come in, it's just that we can do a, a what we call a, a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on, and confirm that might be the diagnosis. Have a look, have a look inside the ear, see if there's any, , anything to see within the ear. OK. So, um, um, so, in answer to your question. No, I don't think that you need to worry about that, I , think you know , preliminarily I can, I can reassure you. OK. However, , in order to definitively reassure you, I, I think you need a physical examination today, OK. , so what I wanna do, is I'm gonna send a message to our admin team, I'll ask them, to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's fine. OK. Um, within Central London. OK, and then you can ring the , the support team number, I'll leave that number in your notes. And you can ring them after five minutes, and then they'll slot you in to a place that's convenient for you, OK. OK. Yeah. , that's fine. All right. So, someone will see you, and hopefully you will be able to reassure further but, please make sure the appointment gets done today. OK, yep, I will do, that's fine. Thank you very much. All right then. OK. Nice to see you. Take care. Bye bye. Bye.
