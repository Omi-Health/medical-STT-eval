Um, yeah so uh, I mean this is, this is a bit embarrassing, but it's, it's uh, hurting when I, , when I use the bathroom, when I pee. And um, it's been going on for a few days, so I'm a, I'm a little bit worried about it. Uh, not sure what to do. Right, well , I, thank you for coming in, so hopefully we can help with your symptoms. Um, so you mentioned it started a few days ago. Um, so, can you tell me a bit more about that, what kind of pain it is, that you're experiencing? Um, it's, it's not too bad, it's sort of like a stinging kind of pain. Um. It's not like unbearable, but uh, it's , it's definitely uh, it definitely bothers me when I pee. Um. And uh, yeah I also maybe sometimes get some like, pain kind of lower down in my tummy, when I, when I go to the bathroom. Uh, yeah. , OK. And, and, uh, the pain in your tummy, is it, can you describe the , the pain to me? Is it cramping, burning, sharp? , yeah, I don't know maybe uh, sort of, sort of cramping. I'm not really sure, but it's not like, it's not like cramping like when I get, when I have a period or something. It's like, I don't know, . Right, right, OK, OK. Um, fine. And, have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal? Um, not, I don't think so, I haven't noticed that. No, OK, fine. Have you noticed any, any funny colour to your urine? So, has there been, uh, , any blood in your urine? Have you noticed any other darkening of urine? Um, there was a little bit of blood earlier today, um, but besides that, not at all, no. Um. It does kind of, it, it kind of like, doesn't smell very, it smells a bit weird I guess, um, but, no, not really anything uh, anything drastic. Yes. OK, fine, OK. Um, right, let me just , write a few notes down as well. Um. , and you mentioned a tummy pain, that also started a few days ago. Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards the back, or towards your flank, the sides? No, not really, no. No, OK, fine. With those symptoms, have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Uh, no, not , not at all. OK. Any fevers, or temperatures? think so. , sorry, was there any, any fevers or temperatures? Sorry, I didn't hear you. No, no, no fever, no. No fever, OK, fine, sorry. Um, OK. Um, in terms of your bowel, are your bowels working OK? Um, uh, I think so, yeah, it seems . So, uh, by that I mean, um, any, any diarrhoea, loose stool? Uh, no, not that I've, not that I've noticed at all. OK, all right. And um, Jessica, sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions, uh, just to , get a full history. Um, hope you don't mind me asking, but are you currently sexually active? Uh, yeah I am. OK, is that with a regular, partner? Ohh, yeah, so I, I've had a boyfriend for about a, a couple of months now, yeah. Fine, OK. Um, have you noticed any other discharge from, from down below? I haven't noticed anything. No, OK. When was your last um, uh, last STD screen? If, if ever? Don't think I've ever, I don't think I've ever had one. No, OK, fine. And, and um. Do you use any form of contraception, at all? Uh, yeah, we use condoms. You use condoms, OK. And when was your last, period? Uh, couple of weeks ago. Three weeks ago, OK. Is there any chance you could be pregnant perhaps? Say again. Is there any chance you could be pregnant? Uh, I don't think so, I don't. No, no. , it's always worth asking uh, young females like yourself, um. Uh, um, so if that obviously you are worried about the pain. Yeah. Um, not getting any better, uh, then I'd always , advise getting a pregnancy test, to rule out pregnancy. OK? Um, fine. So just moving on, moving on. Are you otherwise fit and well? Uh-huh. Um, yeah, I think I'm, I'm feeling OK, otherwise, yeah. And so by that I mean, do you have any other medical problems, medical , medical history? Um, so, in the past I've had some uh, some IBS. Um. But, other than that I think no like uh, real serious medical problems that seem, yeah. OK. Do you take any regular medications? Uh, no, I did uh, I did uh, a little bit ago, or a couple of days ago, try some uh, over the counter bicarbonate, to try and help with the pain but it wasn't, it wasn't really helping. OK. So you've tried that and it didn't help? OK, all right. Um, do you have any allergies to any medications? Uh, yeah, I'm allergic to, Clindamycin. And what happens when you take Clindamycin? Um, I, I get some like a, a, a swelling, basically. Right then, OK. So it's quite a, seems like a quite severe allergy to it, is , is that right? Um, OK. Fine. In terms of your family history, is there anything I should be aware of, um, related to kidneys, bladder, bowels, guts? Yeah. Uh, no I don't think so, not that I, not anything I know about. OK, all right. And tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's lives, who's at home with you? Um, so I live in a, live in a flat near my college, with a, a couple of like friends of mine. Uh, so I'm, I'm not like living at home or anything. Um. OK, and what . about sorry. OK, and are you a, are you working at the moment, or are you a student? I'm a student. OK, and what are you studying? Uh, I'm studying biology. And how's that going? Um, it's good yeah, it's really, it's really interesting uh, learning about, learning about how uh, how the world works, yeah. great. Do you have any aspirations for the future, in terms of careers? Uh, I don't know, maybe a doctor someday, you never know. , recommend it, we need doctors. Um, what about smoking and alcohol? Do you drink much in the way of, , do you, do you smoke, or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Uh, I don't, I don't smoke, uh, I do drink, like on the weekends, yeah. , so socially, OK. All right. Um, right, excellent. So, um, at this stage I , I would proceed to examination. Yeah. But um, based on your story, um, just to summarise really. So, last three days, you've been having bit of burning pain on passing urine. A bit of, crampy tummy pain lower down. Um, , essentially but, but no other fevers or back pain, uh, if I, if I understand correctly. I think probably do have what we call a simple UTI or urinary tract infection, bladder infection, um, which can be readily treated. So, I'll give you a course of antibiotics today. Mm-hmm. OK. Something, called either Nitrofurantoin, or Trimethoprim. Uh, and it's normally a three day course. Uh, so, one tablet, twice a day, for three days. OK. And , that should hopefully help your symptoms, but I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids. Let's try and flush that, you know, that infection out of your body, if you can. OK. Um, you can try, cranberry juice, that can sometimes help with your symptoms. Um, and if you're still not better, by the end of this week, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me. And uh, we can have another look at your symptoms. OK, so three days of the medication, and then wait a little bit, if it still doesn't go away, call back, that OK? OK. Yeah, yeah absolutely. And things to look out for would be, you know, if you are having kind of, high temperatures, a back pain, um just , generally feeling more unwell. Uh, you know, I do want you give me a call back, 'cause then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we wanna avoid. So, do, do give me a call if you're having any concerns, OK. OK. OK, is there, is there anything like, like, should I be worried about? Like, like, not having sex or anything within the next week, or anything like this? Yeah I mean if you can try and avoid it, I think that'd be sensible. Um, uh, it's great that you're using barrier contraception. I would recommend you to continue using barrier contraception, but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up. That'd probably be the best for you and your boyfriend,. OK, OK. Uh, that, that makes sense. Ohh, OK, thank you so much. All right. Great. Thank you very much. Wish you all the best. Yeah, thank you. Take care.
