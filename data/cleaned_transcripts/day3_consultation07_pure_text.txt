Over the counter Hydrocortisone. That, does that ring a ? Yeah. So you're using the Hydrocortisone, yeah? Yes. Are you using any antihistamines at all? I No. No, no antihistamines. OK. Right, fine. Otherwise, other than those rash, you're feeling well in yourself. There's no temperature, no joint pains, yeah? No fever? But, I remember that I've tried and it didn't work. You've tried the antihistamines and it didn't work. OK which one did you try? The one over-the-counter. OK, so like cetirizine, yeah? Yeah, OK, that's fine. Right. OK, so from what you're describing, It looks like, you know, it is quite widespread, your eczema. Yeah? 'Cause you're having it all over your chest and hands and things like that. Um. So do you have any allergies to any medication at all? Mm-hmm. No, no allergies. No allergies, OK. And you don't, other than eczema you don't have any other medical condition.

Mother has migraine and, what was the other one, I didn't understand. hypothyroidism. who who has hypothroidism? My mother. OK. So, she has hyperthyroidism. OK. That's fine. Right here, you mentioned you have asthma. So, what medications are you using for asthma? Um uh, you know, probably neither. Uh The blue inhaler? So you don't, you don't use it everyday, so you just use it on and off, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Blue inhalers. But your breathing's all OK, yeah? OK, yeah, yeah. It's only when I have a flare. Yeah. Sure. So, what we need to do is, obviously, you've got , as I've mentioned. So, extensive eczema. What we'll do, we need a couple of minutes. Because to keep your a bit comfortable, we'll, you would probably need some antihistamines, which I'm going to prescribe. Also, hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you use for young children. You might probably need a bit more stronger one, like betnovateor something like that. OK? So we'll try that first. So I'm going to it's called the antihistamine is called Fexofenadine. And then we'll try with some Betnovate first. So it's like very small amount, like it's like one fingertip. Yeah. This much is, is enough to cover your palms. And your - back of your hands, yeah? So it's very small amounts, so that if you can imagine you can cover with a very small amount the whole body. Yeah. So use that. You, you have to use it twice a day, for the next couple of weeks. OK. If, if there's no improvement, you need to get back to us. Or, if you have any kind of adverse reaction, like an allergic reaction, which is unlikely, but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us. OK? OK. OK. Thank you very much. So, what we're going to do is, we're going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy. It looks like Boots on the systems, is that correct? Yeah? Yes, so i'll send it across to Boot's. And it will be there for collecting. Yes. If things are getting worse in the next two weeks, call us before hand. Otherwise, wait for two weeks, take the medication and the cream. You still need to continue on your, emollients like the dermal soap, and, as well as the, diprovate. Yeah, so you still need to use those, in the interim. Any questions at all? No. No questions. Thank you. Thank you very OK then. You take care then. Bye bye now. OK. Bye. Bye.
