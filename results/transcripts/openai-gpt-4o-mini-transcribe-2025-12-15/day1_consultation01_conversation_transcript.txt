Hello. Hello, how are you? Hi. Should we stop? Yeah, okay. Hello, this morning, so how can I help you this morning? Hi, I've just had some diarrhoea for the last three days, and it's been affecting me. I need to stay close to the toilet, and yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities. I'm sorry to hear that. And when you say diarrhoea, what do you mean by diarrhoea? Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often, or are your stools more loose? Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stool, going to the toilet quite often, and like some pain in my lower stomach. Okay, and how many times a day are you going, let's say, over the last couple of days? Probably like six or seven times a day. Six or seven times a day. And you mentioned it's mainly watery. Have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools? No, no blood, yeah, just watery and loose stool. Okay, and you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well? Yep. Whereabouts is the pain exactly? So it's like in my lower abdomen, so like, yeah, just to one side. One side, and what side is that? On the left side. Left side, okay. And can you describe the pain to me? Yeah, it feels like a cramp, like a muscular cramp, and yeah, I feel a bit weak and shaky. Okay, and does the pain, is it there all the time or does it come and go? It comes and goes. Does the pain move anywhere else, like up towards your back? No, just mainly in my stomach. Okay, all right. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well. What do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been having, have you been feeling feverish, for example? Yeah, it doesn't feel like, yeah, I just mainly feel weak. I haven't had a fever at the moment, but I did notice a temperature when the symptoms started, so. Yeah, around about three or four days ago. Did you measure your temperature then? Yeah, I didn't measure my temperature, no, but I felt just a bit hot. Okay, okay. Any other symptoms like sweating or light? No. No. And any vomiting at all? Yeah, so I vomited at the start of the symptoms, but now I've stopped vomiting. You've stopped vomiting, okay. And was your vomit, I know it's not nice to talk about, but was it just normal food colour? Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit. Yeah. And there was no blood in your vomit, is that right? No blood, no. Right, okay. And any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhoea, you mentioned your vomiting. Anything else that comes to mind? I had a loss of appetite, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids. Okay, so you're drinking fluids. What kind of foods have you managed to eat, if anything? Just soups and, yeah, light foods, like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly. Okay, fine. And so you started three days ago, the symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms to kick on? So, for example, things like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people who would sing the symptoms? Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, but other than that, I've, yeah, been eating normally. Nothing unusual, yeah. Do you remember what you ate? Yeah, I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Okay. Anyone else unwell with similar symptoms? So no one else in the family, so I have a wife and two kids, and one child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhoea. It's no one with the same symptoms. Okay, okay, fine. Right, and in terms of your overall health, are you normally fit and well? Yeah, I mean, other than asthma, I use an inhaler. Everything else is fine. Okay, and is your asthma well controlled? Yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler and that's under control. And you don't have any other tummy problems and bowel problems I should be aware of? No. No, okay. Apart from inhalers, do you take any other medications? No, no other medications. Okay, fine. And in terms of just your day-to-day life, you said it's been affecting your life. Yeah. In what way has it been affecting your life? So I need to stay close to the toilet because I go quite frequently during these past three days. Okay. Yeah, other than that, it's, yeah, the main concern. And have you, are you currently working at the moment? Yeah, I work. You work? I'm an accountant. Okay, have you been going into work the last three days or have you been at home? Yeah, I've been going to work. Okay, that must be difficult for you then. Yeah, it's been quite difficult. Right. And you said you mentioned you live with a wife and two children, is that right? Yes, yeah. All right, just a couple of other questions we need to ask. Do you smoke at all? No, I don't smoke. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No, I don't drink alcohol, no. Okay. So normally at this stage, I'd like to examine you if that's okay. But having listened to your story, so I think just to recap, for the last three days, you've been having loose stool, diarrhoea, a bit of tummy pain mainly on the left-hand side, and vomiting and feeling generally quite weak and lethargic. You mentioned you're having this Chinese takeaway as well three days ago, and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. Okay. It seems like you may have something called gastroenteritis. Okay. which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your tummy, mainly caused by viruses, but there can be a possibility of bacteria causing the symptoms. At this stage, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management, so I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids. There are things like diorolite you can get from the pharmacy, which it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. And if you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would certainly recommend that in the first couple of days. Yeah. If you are feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, a few tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. I would certainly advise you to take some time off work, actually. I know you're quite keen to work. I would say the next two to three days, as the infection clears from your system, take some time off and rest. If your symptoms haven't got better in three to four days, I'd like you to come back and see me again. Because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing the symptoms, and we may need to do further tests, like taking a sample of your stool so we can test that, etc., etc. Yeah, sure. How does that sound? That sounds great, yeah. Do you have any questions for me? No, no further questions, no. Okay, is the treatment plan clear? Yeah, yeah, that's very clear. Thank you. Great, well, I wish you all the best. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Bye.
