Hello, I'm Dr. Smith from Babylon. Hi there, can you confirm your full name, date of birth, and the first line of your address, please? Can you confirm your date of birth and the first line of your address? OK, and your address? OK, are you in a private place where you can have a consultation? Yes, definitely.

OK, and whereabouts in your abdomen do you think it is? Can you just explain to me whereabouts it is? OK, and is it in the middle or to one side? I know, it's in the middle. And is it around your belly button or above or below that? Below, yeah, below. And is it there all the time or does it come and go? It's there all the time. OK, and what would you say is on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've ever had? It might be an 8. OK. And have you, are you having any other symptoms with it? Yeah, like, as in like, I have like vaginal sometimes bleeding, but it's like a light colour and sometimes I'm constipated, like. OK, so when was your last period? Well, last month, two weeks ago. I'm sorry, about two weeks, three weeks ago. OK, and are you having sexual intercourse regularly? Yes, yes, I do. Four weeks ago, I did four days ago, sorry, I just had. OK, are you using any contraception? Yes, I am. I'm using from last one year and Implanon, it's called Implanon. OK, and do you have your periods when you, since you've been using the Implanon, do you have periods regularly or are they sporadic? It was there, they are sporadic, like not the time, it changes, yeah. Right, OK. And was your last period normal? Yeah. And any problems with nausea or vomiting? Yeah, I feel nauseated, like I feel like vomiting, but I don't, I get nauseated, but I don't vomit. Right, and have you been eating and drinking OK? Yeah, yeah, my regular eating and drinking and other things is OK, but it's just very uncomfortable at times. OK, and have you opened your bowels normally? Sorry? Have you opened your bowels normally? What problems did you have last week? Okay, and what about this week? Are you going to the toilet every day? And is the stool normal or diarrhoea or hard stool? Yeah, not like last week. And you said you'd had some vaginal bleeding? Is that since your period stopped? Yeah, my period stopped like last two weeks ago and this is different. I can see it because it's not really like dark, it's just like pink colour. So I don't know what is it. I cannot say exactly what it is, but I can see it in the. Any abnormal discharge, other discharge or just the slight bleeding? Any difficulty breathing or pain in your shoulders or anything like that? No. And have you had a high temperature? Have you got a thermometer? No, I don't. Do you feel feverish? No. And do you feel faint when you stand up? No. What have you been doing for the last few days? Have you been at work as normal or had to stay at home? I have been doing my work and regular other activities like cooking and stuff. It seems okay, just when I get the pain, it's just very bad. Okay, but you said the pain's constant there all the time, or is it getting worse from time to time? It is getting worse. Okay, have you had any other medical problems in the past? Yeah, I have allergy. I have myxaline. Pardon? I have oral myxaline allergy. Okay, anything else? Have you had any operations? No. Have you had any pregnancies? No. Have you taken a pregnancy test this time? Yeah, I did. When was that? Yeah, like a month ago. Okay, but not since you've had the abdominal pain. Okay, and any surgery in the past? And what's your job day to day? Yeah, I'm a teacher. Okay, and who do you live with at home? My husband and my husband's family. Okay, and do you smoke or drink alcohol? No. Do you take any other drugs? No. Have you been abroad recently? Yes. Whereabouts to? About a year. Pardon? A year ago. Oh, a year ago, not recently. No. And any problems passing water? No. Any pain or strong smell or having to go more often than normal? No, I don't really, I have noticed that I don't really go often like before, so. Yeah, I do. I do drink a lot though. Right, okay. And any weight loss or blood in the stool or urine? Yes, I have, as I said, I have some discharge and bleeding, but then I don't, other than that, there is no other discharge. Fine. I think with the abdominal pain, as it's getting worse and it's been going on for the last few days, it would be very helpful to be able to examine you properly. Would you be happy to have an examination with the doctor? Yes. Okay, so what we can do is we can arrange a face-to-face examination where they can see you in a clinic and do an abdominal examination and advise further from then when we've got more of an idea of what's causing the problem. Would you be happy to call the support line and arrange that appointment? Yes. Okay, that's fine. So we'll do that. In the meantime, if it gets a lot worse or you're not holding any fluids down, then we should see you before then. Did you say your pregnancy test was a month ago? Yes. Okay, and your implant arm was just put in a year ago? Yes. The other thing we would need to do is to do a pregnancy test today, if possible. I would do it. So if you can do that today and if it's positive, we need to see you straight away, so give us a call back. Yes. Okay, have you got any other questions? Right, okay. So if you call the support line and make an appointment, we'll go from there. Thanks. Bye.
