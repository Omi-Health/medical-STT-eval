Alex? Oh, hello. Hi, can you hear me? Yeah. OK, great. How can I help you this morning, sir? All right, so I've been feeling, I've been feeling kind of under the weather for the past four days. It started with a sore throat and runny nose, and it's sort of, it's sort of going into a cough now. The sore throat is kind of going away, but I'm starting to cough. OK. So I see here that I kind of bad and tired. Mm, OK, I'm sorry to hear that. I see that there's a lot going on there. So let's start with your sore throat first. Tell me a bit more about that if you can. So I, you know, I think it all started with a colleague of mine. She just kept sneezing next to me all the time. I think her kids are catching something from their kindergarten or something. And, you know, it started as normal sore throat and it was quite painful for a couple of days, but then it was passed. OK, OK. And did you have any difficulty or pain or swallowing? Yeah, yeah, it was quite painful to swallow for one of the days. Did you manage to have a look in the back of your throat in the mirror? No, not really. No, OK, you didn't notice any abnormal white spots or redness at the back of your throat? No. I didn't think about looking. That's okay, that's okay. And you mentioned a runny nose. Again, what kind of discharge is coming out? Is it clear or is it a bit more coloured? Yeah, yeah, it's clear, but I'm sort of getting my nose stuffed all the time. It's very hard to get it free. Okay, so you feel quite congested, do you? Yeah, quite congested. Okay, all right. You also mentioned a cough as well. Can you tell me a bit more about that? Yeah, that started recently, like just maybe yesterday, and it's dry for now. It's not very painful, but it's sort of there all the time. Okay, and is it worse at any particular time of the day? Sorry? Is it worse at any particular time of the day, for example, in the evenings, nighttime, mornings? Or is it throughout the day? No, it's sort of constant. I forgot to mention that I'm also having night sweats. Night sweats, okay. That's very odd, actually, and sort of makes me a bit tired. It makes my sleep a bit uneasy. I can imagine, yes. And this has, again, been going on for the last three, four days, has it? Yeah, yes. Okay. Right, okay. Have you noticed any fevers or temperatures at all? Um, I had some fever in the beginning, but it's now sort of going down. I've been taking some paracetamol and ibuprofen for that, and they help. That's very sensible. Very good. In terms of your chest otherwise, have you any difficulty breathing or any pain in your chest? So no pain in chest, but I noticed that I feel a bit winded on exertion. So I haven't been going to the gym because of that. When you say winded, do you feel more short of breath, would you say, on exertion? is that what you put it? And that's mainly on exercise, but when you're resting, there's no problem. Yeah, yeah, when I'm resting, it's okay. So I've been actually going to work and sort of managing. Okay, just a couple of other questions, sir, if you don't mind. Any pain in your ears at all? No. You don't feel blocked or any discharge coming out of your ears? I don't think so. Okay, fine. What I'm going to do, I'm just going to run through a few yes, no questions, if you don't mind, just a review of your systems. Any headaches at all? Yeah, yeah, that's still there. Whereabouts are the headaches? Just sort of general, and they're not always there, but every now and then they would come and go. Okay, and with these headaches, have you had any problems with your eyesight, your vision? No. Any difficulty with seeing bright lights? No, I don't think so. Okay, and just moving down now, in terms of any feeling of nausea or any vomiting? Okay, tell me about your bowels. Are your bowels working okay? Yeah, yeah, I think so. Is your passing urine okay? Yeah, yeah. How's your appetite, sir? Yeah, I've been drinking a little bit more than the usual, but other than that. Okay, and you're eating and drinking, you're eating okay otherwise? Maybe a bit less than what I would usually have. Okay, have you noticed any funny rashes at all on your skin? No, no. And any general muscle pain or aches, joint pain or muscle pain? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's sort of started in the past couple of days. Yeah, okay. All right, and just have a look at the rest of your history. Are you otherwise fit and well, or do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? So otherwise, I'm fine. There isn't anything that I'm taking or I'm being treated for. Okay. So you are otherwise fit and well. Any allergies at all to any medication that I should be aware of? No, no. Okay. Any family history at all, Sir? Anything relevant in the family that I should be aware of? Anything like diabetes, high blood pressure? Yeah, my grandma has diabetes. Your brother? My grandma. You say grandma, sorry, my apologies, grandma. Okay, do you know what type of diabetes it is? Is it type 1? I think it's type 2. Okay. Anything else which you think is significant? Yeah, I think one of my great granddads had an eczema. Excellent, okay. Okay, just moving on to what we say social history, just get to know you a bit more as a person. Tell me, who do you live with at home? I live alone. Okay, and you said you're working at the moment, is that right? Yeah, yeah. What do you do for work? I'm an accountant. Okay, and how's your work going at the moment over the last... Has it been affecting your work? A little bit, I've been a bit slower and you know, it's a bit of a stressful period just around the end of the year. Right, okay. Is that stress affecting your mood at all in any way? No, I think it's, you know, it's the good kind of stress. It's good work. If there's anything you ever want to talk to me about, you can always come see me about your mood and stress and anxiety. We're happy to help. No, no, I like my job, it's just, you know, it's a bit more work than usual. Okay, okay. And just very briefly, just in terms of smoking, do you smoke at all? Yeah, occasionally, you know, cigars and things on company parties. Okay, so not regular. And what about alcohol? Occasionally, I would have some. I'm not a very big drinker. Probably socially with work. Okay, so just having listened to your story, really just to summarise, you know, it's the last four days you've been feeling generally quite unwell, sore throat, runny nose, bit of a dry cough, bit of muscle pain, weakness, had an initial fever but now settled. I don't think there's a lot to worry about. I think you probably have, you know, a bit of a viral, what we say, a viral illness, maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection or maybe early signs of a flu. These normally last for about seven to 10 days and just gets better really over time. But things you can do to really help yourself is get plenty of rest. I'll probably advise you taking a day or two off work if you can. Making yourself, you know, pushing fluids and making yourself well hydrated, continuing with the regular paracetamol and ibuprofen, and we should see how things go really. If next week you're still not better, I'd like you to come back and see me. Is that clear? Does that make sense? Yeah, that's all good. That makes sense. I think I'll take a couple of days off. Yeah. And see how it goes. And things to look out for if you're really not getting better, if you have a high fever or your breathing is becoming a bit more laboured or chest pain, I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner. Give me a call and we can help you out, OK? Yeah, yeah, understood. I'll take care. Great. Have a great day. Good luck with your work. Thank you. Thank you. You too. Bye-bye.
