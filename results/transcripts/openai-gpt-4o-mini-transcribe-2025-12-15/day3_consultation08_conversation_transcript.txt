Okay, and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Yep, that's absolutely fine. Okay, so you've mentioned on our notes that you're having a bit of a cough and a cold. Is that correct? Yeah, yeah, it's just, it's been going on for like a few days now. Sort of like coughing and like just, you know, general runny nose and stuff. Can you just confirm, is it two to three days or longer? About like five days, around that. Yeah, it started like, what day is it today? Yeah, at the week, it started at the start of the weekend. Okay, so it started off with a cold, did it? Yeah, it's sort of just like coughing and like runny nose and like kind of muscles aching and stuff, like occasionally just feeling like, you know, cold chills and things like that. Hot and cold, yeah. And so about your cough, are you bringing up any phlegm at all? No, no, it's like a, it's like a dry cough. It's sort of like, like almost hacking, hacking kind of like. You're not bringing up any blood, are you? No. No, okay. Are you feeling short of breath at all? No, no, no shortness of, like, yeah, I'm breathing fine. Yeah, so you're not wheezy or sort of rattly noises in your chest? No. OK. Right, so what have you taken so far? So just, like, painkillers and such. I mean, in addition to, like, my normal medication and such. But like... So you mentioned, you have come to your normal medications, but you've mentioned you've taken some painkillers, like, could you tell me the names, please? I would just like paracetamol. Paracetamol, OK. Any ibuprofen at all? No. No. OK. And also, you've mentioned some regular medication. Unfortunately, I don't have your medical, complete medical history, so if you could tell me what your medications are and what you use them for. Yes, so I take, what's it called, like metformin. I'm a diabetic, so, and I also, like, have lisinopril. Lisinopril, OK. For the, like, because of my blood pressure. Yeah, OK. And how long have you been a diabetic for? Like a few years, maybe five or six years. Five, six years. OK. OK. Do you monitor your blood sugars at all? Yes. OK. And how have they been doing at the moment? No issues, nothing, like, out of the ordinary there. OK, so there's no problems with your blood pressure control at the moment, even though you're on... OK, so that's, that's absolutely fine. And when was the last time you took your blood pressure? It would have been this morning. This morning. And what was, what was the readings like? I can't remember off the top of my head, but it was within the normal range. Sure, because there was nothing alarming, yeah? Normal. Okay, absolutely fine. Okay, so that seems all right. Okay, so can I, hypothetically, look into your mouth here? Sure. Yeah? Yeah, okay, so just... Yeah, okay, so looking into your mouth, you know, there's just a bit mild redness at the back of your throat. There's no enlarged tonsils. Can you feel any glands around your neck at all? No, I haven't had anything like that. Okay, so it looks like it's just a viral infection because it's just a cold and a cough. There's nothing there. And generally, if you have things like a chest infection, you would have a bit like a wheeze or shortness of breath. So things that we would recommend is you can use the, you know, night nurse, day nurse. It's still okay with your medications, yeah? So I'm sure you were a bit wary to use them, but it's still okay with your current medication. You can still use that. It might be able to make you feel a bit more better quickly. If there's any change, like you're feeling short of breath or your symptoms are lasting more than three weeks or something, or you're becoming poorly, things like that, then you need to get in touch with us. Then probably we might need to examine you and especially your chest. But I don't think so. That's necessary at this point in time. Okay, that sounds good. Okay, any questions at all? No, I think that's been very helpful. Thank you. Okay, so just to round up, just use the night nurse, day nurse. If any change in your symptoms, like shortness of breath, wheezy, or symptoms are lasting more than three weeks, then get in touch with us. Okay, so I don't need any prescription or anything like that. No, you don't need anything at the moment. OK, take care then. Thank you very much. Bye bye.
