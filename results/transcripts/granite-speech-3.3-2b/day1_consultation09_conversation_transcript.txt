symptoms um so you mentioned it started a few days ago um so can you tell me a bit more about that what kind of pain it is that you're experiencing um it's it's not too bad it's sort of like a stinging kind of pain um it's not like unbearable but uh it's it's definitely a definitely bothers me in my p and uh yeah i also maybe sometimes get some like pain kind of lowered down in my tummy when i when i go to the bathroom okay and and uh the pain in your tummy is it can you describe the the pain to me is it cramping burning sharp yeah i show up um yeah i don't know maybe uh sort of sort of cramping i'm not really sure but it's not like it's not like cramping like when i get when i have a period or something it's like i don't know okay okay um fine and have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal um not i don't think so i haven't noticed that no okay floyd have you noticed any any funny color to your urine so has it been uh any funny color to your urine has there been any blood in your urine or have you noticed any darkening of your urine um there was a little bit of blood earlier today um but besides that not at all no um it does kind of it's it's kind of like doesn't smell very it smells a bit weird i guess um but no not really anything uh anything drastic okay fine okay um right let me just write a few notes down as well um fine and you mentioned the tummy pain that also started a few days ago does the pain move anywhere else does it move towards the back or towards your flank the sides no not really no no okay fine but there's symptoms have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea vomiting uh no not not at all okay any fevers or temperatures sorry any any fevers or temperatures sorry i didn't hear you no no no fever no fever okay fine sorry um okay um in terms of your bowel are your bowels making okay um i think so yeah it seems to be um any any diarrhea loose stool uh no not that i've not that i've noticed at all okay all right and um jessica sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions uh just to get a full history um hope you don't mind me asking are you currently sexually active um yeah i am okay is that with a regular partner um yeah so i i've had a boyfriend for about a couple months now yeah fine okay um have you noticed any other discharge from from down below i haven't lost anything no okay when was your last um last std screen if if ever uh i don't think i've ever i don't think i've ever had one okay fine um and um do you use any form of contraception at all oh yeah we use condoms we use condoms okay remember was your last period a couple of weeks ago is there any chance you could be pregnant perhaps say again so is it any chance you could be pregnant i don't think so it's always worth asking young females like yourself so if i obviously if you are worried about the pain not getting any better then i would always advise you doing a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy okay fine so just moving on moving on are you otherwise fitting well um yeah i think i'm i'm feeling okay otherwise yeah and so by that i mean do you have any other medical problems medical history um so in the past i've had some uh some ibs um but other than that i think no like uh you know serious medical problems that seem yeah very good do you take any regular medications um no i did uh i did a little bit ago or a couple days ago try some over-the-counter bicarbonate to try and help with the um i i get some like a a swelling basically but in terms of your family history is there anything i should be aware of um related to kidneys bladder bowels gut uh no i don't think so not that i not anything i know about okay all right and tell tell me a bit more about your home situation who's who's at home with you um so i live in a live in a flat near my college with a couple like friends of mine so i'm not like living at home or anything okay it would be like you're asking about sorry okay and are you are you working at home or are you a student i'm a student okay what are you studying biology and how that's going um it's good yeah it's really it's really interesting uh learning about learning about how how the world works yeah great do you have any aspirations for the future in terms of career i don't know maybe a doctor someday you never know recommend it we need doctors um what about smoking and alcohol do you drink much in a way of do you smoke or do you drink much in a way of do you smoke or do you drink much of alcohol i don't i don't smoke i do drink like on the weekends socially okay all right um right excellent so um at this stage i'll i'll proceed to examination but based on your story just to summarize really it's the last three days you've been having bit of burning pain and passing urine a bit of crampy tummy pain lower down um essentially but but no other fevers or back pain if i understand correctly i think you probably do have what we call a simple uti or urinary tract infection bladder infection which can be readily treated so i'll give you a course of antibiotics today something called either nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim and it's normally a three day and it's normally a three day course so one tablet twice a day for three days and that should hopefully help your symptoms but i also advise you to drink plenty of fluids let's try and flush that you know that infection out of your body if you can you can try cranberry juice that can sometimes help with your symptoms and if you're still not better by the end of this week i want to give you a call or come back and see me and we can have another other look at your symptoms okay so three days of the medication and then wait a little bit if it still doesn't go away yeah absolutely and things to look out for would be you know if you are having kind of high temperatures back pain just generally feeling more unwell you know do we have to have a call back because then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys which is something we want to avoid so do give me a call if you have any so do do give me a call if you have any concerns okay okay is there is there anything like like should i be worried about like like not having sex or anything within the next week or anything like this i mean if you can try and avoid it i think that'll be sensible um he he's greatly using barrier conception i recommend you to continue using barrier conception but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up that'll probably be the best for you and your boyfriend okay okay all right uh that that makes sense great um okay thank you so much maurice wish you all the best yeah thank you take care
