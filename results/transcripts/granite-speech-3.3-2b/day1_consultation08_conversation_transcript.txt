stressed at work for the past few days and i've realized that i've got really dry itchy skin okay sorry here work's been so stressful um tell me more about your skin first leo tell me you mentioned it's been dry and itchy um where abouts on your skin all over my arms um and my hands mainly okay um and is this something you've had before i i know so did it did it come about quite suddenly or was it more kind of a gradual thing i think it started a few days ago okay and has it spread anywhere else has it spread to your chest your legs your face no okay so apart from being dry and itchy any other symptoms has it been sore has it been in have you noticed cracked skin and so my skin's quite red and i'm using coconut butter for the past few days okay because i have a spot okay and no fever and i'm not sweating either thank you for mentioning all those okay so the coconut butter hasn't helped with the itch no okay and you mentioned work has been quite stressful what do you for work um i work as a teacher okay and uh in what way has work been stressful i think the kids have been really annoying these days okay well in what way have you really long hours okay all right well i'm sorry okay all right well i'm sorry to hear that and i hope you get better um going back to your skin is it anything you've done perhaps uh which may have triggered your symptoms anything you've touched or i mean if it's off a shower gel soaps fabricate fabricators i went swimming a few days ago okay is that the first time in your life or have you been before and now i've been before okay and did your symptoms start after you went swimming yes okay all right um you mentioned you've had no other fevers that right no fevers no vomiting no no how's your health otherwise that's pretty good yeah i'm not on any medication okay we'll get to medication just a second um do you feel genuinely run down do you feel tired uh yeah i think i have been quite tired okay are you eating and drinking okay yeah i've been drinking and eating as normal your appetite's fine is it okay and your bowels are your bowels working okay yeah no no problems with vomiting or loose stools no okay and your water works are all okay you passed the urine test yep okay all right um so just moving on in terms of your other medical histories anything else i should be aware of i'm currently taking mircette mircette yeah okay do you know what that is no okay it's a contraceptive pill does that make sense is that something you does that ring a bell now oh yes okay is it any other medications that you take oh no no so in terms of your medical history there's no problems of skin problems in the past ones like eczema or um dermatitis no i think it might just be the weather so sorry was that you think it's i think it might just be the weather the weather yes oh you've seen the weather okay you've seen the weather okay no it's okay no problems um um move and do you suffer from allergies are you someone who suffers from allergies um allergies medication allergies i think um i'm a i'm lactose intolerant lactose intolerant okay that could be helpful to know um fine in terms of family history is there anything in the family that you're aware of um yeah so um my dad has asthma and my mom has hepatitis hepatitis yeah okay um fine but any skin problems i should be aware of no no okay all right socially who do you live with at home trust me live alone yep and do you smoke at all do you can you ask do you smoke are you a smoker no i don't do you drink much alcohol no recreational drugs and you can you manage you work as a primary school teacher yes that's right the reason i ask is something stress can be a contributing factor um you felt you noticed yourself finding life more stressful recently all right do you think that might have any correlation to your symptoms i don't think so okay all right um fine okay well normally at least i'd like to proceed examination but based on your story it's difficult i think you know you've essentially the story is you've got dry itchy rash on your mainly your hands you mentioned and your arms which started perhaps after swimming a few days ago um but knowing all the symptoms you're feeling otherwise well no fevers no bleeding or discharge from skin i wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis um have you heard of that condition before i have yes okay um great well i can give you a patient information leaflet about that which gives a bit more information about the disease but um it's something that we can readily treated um with a couple of options we have steroid creams i can give you um which will help with a couple of options you have steroid creams i can give you which will help with the inflammation and something called emollients which can help with the dry dry skin and that's something you just need to kind of paste on onto your skin throughout the day for the next few days and hopefully that helps your symptoms okay cool thank you very much um you can also try antihistamines so you can get things over the counter peritin loratadine that can sometimes help with the itchiness yeah that sounds good okay and um that's probably what i would recommend paracetamol on this occasion wouldn't be helpful um uh painkillers wouldn't be helpful on this occasion but let's let's let's see how the next few days go and if it's still not getting better come back and see still not getting better back and come see me next week and we can have another look again at your symptoms okay perfect thank you very much great do you have any questions for me i know okay well wish you all the best have a good day oh thank you very much bye
