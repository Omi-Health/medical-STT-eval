short of breath and it kind of feels like someone's sitting on my chest right okay now do you have these symptoms right now or have they gone off now no they're still present okay so you've still got the chest discomfort right now yes okay um we're probably going to have to call an ambulance for you okay so what i'm going to do is an ambulance for you okay okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to task my colleague next to me to sort that out while we do that i'm going to ask you a few more questions okay so just just to double check um where exactly in the chest is the pain um it's in the uh middle of my chest um over uh yeah my my peck so um yeah but not not necessarily to one side and it's quite a diffuse pain is it spreading anywhere else like down to your arm up to the jaw and the neck and like that yeah it's it's um mainly in my left arm uh it's feeling a little bit um uh painful and and in my shoulder as well right okay do you remember what you remember what you were doing at the time yeah so it started just when i was gardening so nothing that was too strenuous um i was just kneeling down and uh yeah it wasn't running or anything i wasn't doing any physical exercise cool okay and how much activity do you do normally do you walk a lot or do you run or do you do anything no i don't i i generally don't do much activity at all um yeah have you had this before no this is the first time actually right okay um are you aware of any palpitations like your heart beating faster or more prominently than normal um yeah it's it's beating a bit faster now i think that's because i'm a little bit stressed um about the situation but i haven't noticed it um beating faster than usual um today so i know you're stressed we've got an ambulance coming on the way okay yeah so i know you're stressed we've got an ambulance coming on the way okay so um we'll take care of everything so don't don't worry you're in the house with you at the moment oh no no one's in the house at the moment okay um and is your front door open oh yes it's open okay so maybe we'll speak maybe in the hallway to the front door have the front door open so that in case um people need access they can access you all right um so um uh are you a smoker at all i yeah i smoke um a fair bit i smoke about 10 cigarettes uh a day um yeah how long we've been smoking for uh for the past 15 years 15 years

symptoms that you've described to me um they indicate the possibility of um a heart attack okay so i'm not saying you definitely have a heart attack but we that it's i'm not saying you definitely have a heart attack but we that's our number one priority to exclude that okay okay so ambulance team will be with you very shortly i'm going to stay on the line with you until they come okay okay yeah thank you when they come what they'll do is they're going to put some stickers on your chest and do an ecg and then they'll decide where to take you after that okay and um what what uh can i just double check do you have um any allergies to any medication yes actually i have um an allergy to aspirin right okay yeah no other allergies sure what's the nature of that allergy to aspirin does it does it cause you heartburn or is it like a allergic reaction yeah it's an allergic reaction so i swell up a bit but nothing life-threatening um i sometimes even have it and it's it's a it's a mild reaction to it okay yeah it's very important that you communicate that to the hospital okay detail you've just told me because we we may need to consider aspirin to spare energy okay um all right um now in terms of um what happens from here the team will assess you and then they may take you take you in to one hospital or another based on how bad what the ecg looks like and what kind of treatment you might need okay okay what i'm going to do is we'll stay on the line for the time being okay until they come and then once they come then i'll hand over to them i'll explain what's going on all right okay okay sure okay thank you
