hello hello hi i'm dr jacob and welcome to babylon hello nice to meet you nice to meet you too so just before we start is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please michael johnson and your date of birth oh nine two nine eighty three okay and your address for me please two three one 231 leonard london street sorry london okay and that's correct and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation yes okay you've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea sorry to hear about it so if you tell me a bit more about it please uh it's been happening for about three days now okay yeah it started off uh was i don't know it's just something that i thought would go away pretty quickly i've had that from time to time after eating certain types of food or going on certain travels but uh nothing funky in my diet or no travels recently um and it's just kind of kept up i'm a bit confused as to what to do so you haven't had anything from outside nothing dodgy anything but no no i don't know just a little bit yeah i don't know i mean it's it's pretty standard diarrhea where there's like a little bit of abdominal pain i threw up once i don't know that was a little worrying uh repeat that please that wasn't clear what did you say i threw up once after that we shit something uh nothing else was worrisome okay right and with the diarrhea how many times a day are you going to the toilet uh four to five four to five times yeah and is it like water or is it just loose what do you mean are you going like water or is it just you know bit bit of solid stew with loose kind of thing it probably depends on the time of day to be honest it's a bit of both and is there any blood or mucus no blood what do you mean mucus it's like the snorty stuff in the stool yeah it looks like snorty no so no mucus okay any fever at all uh maybe a little bit but it hasn't been that in particular hasn't been too worrying are you still able to eat and drink a little bit of appetite loss i guess versus the normal okay but also not something i like if that was alone i wouldn't have sure so but you're you're still able to drink quite a bit yeah you're drinking plenty yeah yeah yeah okay mostly to try and win okay and um what have you taken have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea nothing yet nothing yet okay anything for the abdominal pain uh nothing yet okay right and any unfortunately we don't have any of your past medical history is there anything you'd like to say uh i probably at asthma um or i don't know i guess i still have it okay and um are you any anything else other than asthma uh my dad had hypertension okay has hypertension yeah hypertension yeah he died of bowel cancer 10 years ago oh dear okay bowel cancer 10 years ago and how old was he when he died uh 62 okay and um you mentioned you had asthma are you using any inhalers at all laxipru yes okay not heard of it i mean is it like salbutamol is it like a blue color yellow yellow okay i'll have to check that one not sure laxipru okay um that's fine any other medication that you're using over the counter anything at all reditly now okay right any allergies nothing yeah nothing no allergies at all right here fine so obviously you know you just have diarrhea's about four to five times a day you're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated which is a good sign okay when we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day that means probably you are you know whatever you're eating is going straight through okay you still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids okay when you go to the toilet things that one would advise is a soft diet so avoid dairy fish meat eggs while you're having the diarrhea sorry what is a soft diet what does that mean like outside of not those things what do you mean by soft okay so that will be like crackers toast jam those kind of things that's easily digested like what we would give babies yeah when they start eating you give simple food for babies you don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding so that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about yeah once you are able to you know keep most of it in you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash once you're okay with that for about 48 hours then you can start having meat so just don't have meat immediately once you feel like you're slightly better because you might go back to square one again okay with that diet like once 48 hours you're not having any diarrhea you're fine then you can go and start having meat egg fish and so that's the evening is getting better but isn't getting or do you want me to go away completely at that point or or if it's like trending up no no no you preferably just don't because what why do we say this this because it takes much more time for meat to get digested so because your gut flora you know the the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these foods while it doesn't take that much of an effort to you know digest mash and vegetables does that make sense yes yeah so at the same time you could have some although you can't eat milk is not a good idea yogurts are a good idea because they are probiotics it helps to build up the normal bacteria back okay so those kind of now things to look out for if your diarrhea doesn't go away in a week's time or if you're passing blood we need a stool sample because that means you may have some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics okay okay if you again as i've mentioned previously if you're going about six to eight times a day that means means there's a high chance that you are having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time if that happens do get in touch with us again all right okay any questions you look a bit confused now that's it yeah okay and also you could get something called diorite over the counter so it helps to replenish the salts that you've been that's lost through going to the toilet okay okay if you're a bit confused you know you can actually all this is all recorded in your app so you can go back i'll put that all in detail so if you know i know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything you can go back and read the notes okay that's great all right then you take care bye now bye
