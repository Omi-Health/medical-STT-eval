you have to do as part of your training as a doctor hello hi hi can you hear me yes i can hear you fine hi my name is dr gohil i'm one of the general practitioners that works here can i check your name and date of birth please uh i am uh patrick smith hi uh 35 years old um october 7th uh 90 great something and patrick are you in a space that's private and quiet yes great and so we're okay to chat yes we are okay so it says here um you are feeling hot and have had severe headaches is that correct yeah it's really affecting my work it comes and goes i kind of feel like it's hard i kind of lose my appetite also one thing that's kind of weird is i sometimes also get like some tingling in my arms okay yeah and like especially for example when i come into the elevator in the morning okay i kind of have my heart is beating kind of fast okay so those are lots of things are they all happening at the same time or most randomly like yeah it's it's it's at different times and do they all happen at the same time or is it one thing one time and one time okay so let's see with the headaches when they do come do you have any idea the headache is going to come not really but generally during work times so it's normally at work i'm at work i'm in a meeting or on my laptop okay and where does the headache sit in your head is it the front or the back um i can't say it's like kind of loud okay and does it go anywhere else does it go anywhere else the headache no it's mostly in the front and then yeah it's kind of stays there and when you have the headache specifically do you feel sick not really but it's like making it hard yeah i kind of feel a little bit nauseous maybe and sometimes i also feel like uh yeah it's like uh maybe probably breathing or something okay and do you normally get headaches before all of this started so no i i feel like my my health situation was mostly under control okay yeah and then let's but it started roughly when i changed jobs okay so talk to me about your job what do you do i'm a lawyer and do you work in london at the moment yes so do you get these headaches on your commute into work not really i get not really i get it mostly when i'm at work okay and tell me about what you do do you sit in front of a computer most of the time or do you speak to people like 50 50 go to meetings and then sit in front of a computer okay so that's a reading and these things have happened mostly when you're sitting at your computer um yeah it happens then yeah okay and tell me what did you do before being a lawyer uh no i was a lawyer a previous job as well okay so talk to me about the stress that you're under at the moment if uh 10 out of 10 is extremely stressful and one out of 10 is being on vacation where you're at the moment i think it's seven or eight all right and is that normal for you yeah it's like a law firm like there's always pressure okay so you mentioned your headaches you also mentioned your reduced appetite so you don't want to eat as much have you lost weight yes can you remember how much you've lost five pounds and is that because you're going to the gym or is that unintentional it's not intentional no okay so have you noticed your clothes feeling looser not really and have people said or commented that you've lost weight no great and another thing that you also mentioned is that you notice tingling in your hands yeah so talk to me about that is it in one hand or both hands and do you get that in your legs as well no and what does it feel like the tingling and again is this the first time you've noticed this okay and the other two things that i've just jotted down is you're feeling hot but you didn't mention that is that correct but like i would say like i get this like feeling of short like short breath okay sometimes so that could be what you were referring to yes so do you feel short of breath while you're sitting at your desk yeah no yes sorry yes okay and how about when you're exercising well okay and the last thing is you mentioned that you noticed your heart beating yeah again how often do you get that i when i like it's maybe once a day uh maybe more uh there's one more thing that i i think i should mention like i do have like some loss of libido at home okay how long has that been happening for like same amount of time really like since i changed my job fine and apart from all of these things that you've told me do you have any other medical problems uh well i have a hypothyroidism okay and do you take medications for that thyroid and are you remembering to take your medications yes okay and do you drink or smoke yes how much do you drink like once a week a couple of glasses of wine okay and i need to ask this to all of my patients but do you do anything else recreational in terms of drugs well okay so you've never taken cocaine or marijuana well okay thank you and are you allergic to anything good so you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment and i i can understand they probably feel quite strange and unusual yeah um i think the best course of action is you come and see one of our doctors in the clinic we can give you an examination and what that means is we check your heart and your breathing make sure that those things are functioning correctly and probably do some blood tests for your thyroid and take it from there how does that sound that sounds very that sounds uh very good thank you i think before we give you any medications we should see you in person okay so what we're going to do is book an appointment or i think you can book an appointment through the app to come and see one of my colleagues yeah i'll let them know what you've told me today so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said thank you great do you have any questions well that was it thank you very much thank you very much bye
