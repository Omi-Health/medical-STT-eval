hello hello can you hear me yeah i can can you hear me hi my name is dr gohil i'm one of the physicians that works at babylon are you in a quiet and private space to talk well i am yes good and can i confirm your name and date of birth please it's joe blogs it's the 7th of june 1974 74 and how old does that make you sorry 54 i'm supposedly 53 but yeah great and it says here um it says you're having chest discomfort is that correct that is correct yes i have experienced this it's gone with my is that correct that is correct yes i'm experiencing some chest discomfort okay can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort when it started and how you're feeling at the moment sure um it's been ongoing for a couple of hours now um i'll say the discomfort quite suddenly i was sitting in the garden and it if i had to describe where it is it's somewhere in the middle of my chest and it's more it feels more like a pressure the discomfort than more than a pain um if i had to describe what that discomfort feeling is it's like someone sitting on my chest and yeah great so you've talked about your chest are you still in discomfort at the moment yes yes okay and when it started how would you rate it out of 10 okay about a seven out of ten and being very sort of unbearable and see if that pain seven is quite manageable but it's quite discomfortable and how about now um it's still the same okay and tell me before this happened what were you doing um i was relaxing my wife and we're watching jeremy kyle okay so garden is the garden okay and how often do you do gardening um every other week so fortnightly and are you normally fit and well so are you normally okay to garden as you would yes great and apart from this do you have any other medical problems high cholesterol and it's had hypertension okay so that's high blood pressure and high cholesterol do you take any medication for that no i do take a medicine are you allergic to anything as as free okay so let me summarize what you've told me already you were gardening a few hours ago and you experienced chest discomfort which was roughly 7 seven out of ten yeah it feels more like someone sitting on your chest as opposed to pain yes that's good and apart from this have you noticed anything else unusual specifically with your breathing yes i have i've got shortness of breath i feel slightly light-headed okay and is that getting worse or better um it's remained the same although i'll say recently i've noticed in terms of sort of breathing i've had some difficulty climbing stairs and if i have to sort of walk uphill there's that sort of challenge as well and when you get short of breath when you're walking up the stairs have you noticed any pain um no pain as such but there's often calf pain and leg swelling okay so let me confirm you have the pressure at the moment and you have shortness of breath is that correct that is correct yes so given what you've told me about your past medical history i think it might be worth you calling an ambulance okay get you to the hospital as soon as possible because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart so while we talk to you i will ring an ambulance who should come to your address all right but in the meantime i think we should stay on the phone so i can gather some more information that we can give to the paramedics is that okay um should i be concerned about anything it's nothing to worry about at the moment but given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol and you've got some chest pain i'm always worried about the heart first before anything else again and we need to look after your heart before anything else so apart from this lightheadedness and this chest discomfort unfit have you noticed anything else unusual nothing else unusual i'm not sure if i spoke to you about nausea i've noticed some nausea but no vomiting yet do you have anything to eat or drink this morning um no and you feel still feel nauseous at the moment i have yeah i am yes so i have a couple of so i have a couple of other questions to ask you and i'm going to reel them off so apologies for not letting you talk very much yeah that's fine have you noticed this pressure radiating to your head uh no to my head no and how about to your left or right arm uh yes there is some pain in my left shoulder and arm and does that pain go anywhere else to your left arm or to your you're back no and have you noticed any problems swallowing or drinking water no good and have you noticed any problems going to the loo no problems going to the loo and you're normally fit and well apart from the two things you told me about yes however there are some problems just performing daily activities um like i said with the difficulty of climbing upstairs and going uphill um i tried to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house not being too strenuous and do you live at home with your wife at the moment yes okay i would suggest if she's there you let her know that you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today so she might need to get her things together okay the ambulance should be there very soon in the meantime i would suggest that you stay calm and have some water if you need to don't take any of those medications again the paramedics should be with you very shortly all right so when they do come there are two things they will be worried about the about okay the one is your chest so your heart and the second is your breathing which is your lungs so they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate so don't be worried and when you get to the hospital you'll be seen by a consultant pretty pretty much immediately that's all right reassuring and coming thanks for that sure so i will let the paramedics do their job and when you're at the hospital the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how everything's going oh that's great great i'll um book another appointment to see you soon once you've had your adventure that's perfect thank you so much no problems do you have any questions for me uh no questions i'll just await the answers great thank you very much no problems i'll speak to you soon thank you so much bye okay
