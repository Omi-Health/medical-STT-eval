doing when the symptoms started are you aware of any triggers not there i don't remember what was i doing i was at home i was working on my computer and yeah i just felt like some nausea and i had to

questions regarding your smoking and alcohol do you do either of those uh not really i drink frequently like socially let's say and i don't smoke okay all right um fine so robert um i think having listened to your story i think you're probably suffering from what we call gastrenteritis which essentially is just a tummy bug it's an infection of your tummy and it normally lasts for about three to five days and gets better all right the things you can do to really help yourself get better soon are you can drink plenty of the fluids really try and flush the toxins out of your body you can get things from the pharmacy which are called diuretics which can help replenish any minerals and vitamins you may have lost sorry what's the name of that it's called diuretate um it's it's a it's a type of fluid replacement drink um you can take some paracetamol if you're feeling feverish and weak i would probably advise you to i would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for the next day or two until you get better normally you have to be diarrhea free for about 20 40 hours before you return back to work um let's see how the next few days go and if you're still not better next week i want to come back and see me and we can have another look at your symptoms okay that sounds good that sounds good thanks so much do do you have any questions for me or no i think that's fine yeah i'll i'll try to rest and drink plenty of fluids and i hope it goes away if it doesn't i'll call back see you okay i really hope you get better soon thanks a lot thanks so much for your time bye-bye okay bye
