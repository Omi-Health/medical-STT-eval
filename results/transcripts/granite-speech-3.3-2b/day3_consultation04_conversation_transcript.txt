confidential conversation thank you okay so you mentioned in your notes that you've got some shortness of breath if you'd like to tell me a bit more about it please yeah so about two to three days ago i was running with a friend and usually i could talk to her whilst i ran but i found myself actually short of breath i'm not really short of breath when i'm walking um but definitely um if i'm walking briskly now um and i've used my blue inhaler but to no avail it hasn't really helped me um so i'm having i'm just wheezing a bit and coughing and just generally a bit short of breath wheezing and coughing okay and you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler so how often are you using the blue inhaler um i think i'm just um i think i'm just using that as an aware now i have symptoms yeah so um at the moment you are having shortness of breath so are you using it every day at the moment um yeah and morning and evening to kind of prevent it as well okay and um which color what's the name of your preventer um it's a blue um i think in totality my history is albuterol clenil cetirizine butyrophenyl cetaben and hydrocodone that i'm taking as well okay so could you repeat that you have clonazepam cetaben and hydrocodone and hydrocodone so you have xm so yeah what's that sorry you do have a history of xm um i brothers asthmatic and my sister has asthma and i've got a few issues that i think could be extra as well okay right so coming back to your you know your shortness of breath you've mentioned you're wheezy and you're coughing are you bringing up any phlegm at all no i don't i'm not coughing up much phlegm okay no speeches okay right to you and how are you using your your clenel so are you using it every day i think i'm using that every day and the sonbeutel just like as and when so how are you using the clenel is it twice a day yes try and okay and have you ever been admitted in hospital because your asthma was so bad um no i haven't okay right here when was the last time you had an asthma attack um about three to four years ago three to four years ago and what what did the gp do at that time um just um encourage me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative okay so you didn't have any steroids or antibiotics not that i can remember okay have you ever had oral steroids in the past no when was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse about two years ago okay but your asthma was pretty under control till till now isn't it yes yes in the last two times so do you do a peak flow meter at home peak flow reading where you blow into you know do you do that no just every now and then i haven't done it over the last since i've had symptoms okay so what was what was your peak flow reading when you're good like normal speak flow reading i think 130 okay let's say it's about 380 yeah 380 okay so what we need okay do you have any allergies at all um i have a fever sorry could you repeat that please sorry i have hay fever okay no any me allergies to medication oh no sorry okay so you're not allergic to anything okay excellent right here so what we need to do that obviously we it you haven't had an asthma attack for some time and it looks like you can be having a small small exacerbation so what i would like you to be seen by one of our genies in the next few days in the interim what i'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when okay i'm going to use it maximum about every two to four hours but if you're using it that often that means you can match that you know your asthma is really bad you can use it but that's not ideal the the brown in your clenel the brown inhaler you can up the dose if you're using just two puffs twice a day you can increase it to four puffs twice a day yeah and while this is to do while you're waiting to see us now mentioned you know you're doing what you know increase the kennel to four puffs twice a day and you're using the asthma you know the blue inhalers every two to four hours and your breathing is getting really worse then you would need to take yourself to a&e you shouldn't wait for our appointment okay appointment okay so when your doctor sees you what we're going to do is we're going to examine your chest yeah make you do the peak flow reading so depending on what we find you might need some antibiotics or some steroids but anyway while you're at home we are going to by increasing your clenel we are increasing your steroid intake anyway okay so yeah so any questions you wanted to ask me yeah so book an appointment call support book an appointment to see and i would recommend that you do the face to face in the interim increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly but if your breathing's getting worse and you've not seen us do take your salbutamol all right thank you so much for your time you're welcome and take care then bye bye
