is a little bit blurred like it's it's really painful and i'm getting really concerned especially because i'm having like these changes in the vision okay so it started this morning was a sudden onset headache did it come on suddenly yeah yeah yeah okay and did it come on really bad or did it start off of like a slight headache and build up to a severe headache it came like kind of suddenly and if you if 10 is the worst pain you've ever felt in your life how bad would you say the pain was between 1 and 10 well i had the kidney stone so let's say that that's 10 um i have now maybe 5 well six six probably but it's more about me being really concerned because this is very weird okay no that's fine have you ever had a headache before sorry have you ever had a headache like this in the past um well not really okay so yeah like this no definitely it's something new if you had to say where across the head the headache is it's across the front around the back it's in one side the left side only and tell me what visual problems are you getting my vision is quite blurry um it's it's it's really weird like some on zigzag lines kind of i don't know how to describe it properly okay and have you tried any painkillers for this already yeah i tried for a couple of months but it didn't work to be honest i feel exactly the same okay um okay um what time did you take the paracetamol how long ago was it you taking it uh well uh the headache headache started like four years four hours ago so i would say like maybe three hours ago because i couldn't stand it and your visual problems is still ongoing now yeah yeah yeah i feel a little bit a little bit working i cannot stand screams but yeah definitely and when i move like the thing is that if i leave bed i start to feel like even worse if i move so i just want to have my head my head like really not moving okay okay um so what about have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit oh yeah oh i forgot to mention definitely i vomited twice actually as soon as the the headache started i also vomited so initially i thought it was something that i ate but then the headache started to be really bad and i still feel nauseous so i'm about to vomit very soon i think all right okay you've mentioned in the past you've had kidney stones any other medical problems sorry you've mentioned that in the past you've had kidney stones have you had any other medical problems in the past so uh not actually uh my mother has migraines i'm not sure if that's relevant and also i have hypothyroidism in the family so it might be i don't know i i don't know what else do you have in the family i think we are losing connection sorry i i think we lost connection oh can you still hear me oh can you still hear me oh it's good yes yeah you can hear me um you said you mentioned your mother has migraines what else do you have in the family hyperthyroidism she also has hyperthyroidism okay fine okay um and no other relevant family history uh no not that i'm aware and do you take any regular medications uh no are you allergic to any medications not that i'm aware of yeah not that i'm aware of okay is there any chance you could be pregnant i really doubt it and so you're not allergic to any medications fine and what what were you thinking might be going on i know you seemed quite worried about it was there anything in particular you were worried about well i'm a little bit hypochondriac so i feel that this can be some kind of brain tumor or something because i'm like this is really the pain is so horrible that or maybe a stroke i don't know it's it's just like you know you hear so many stories that you definitely start to wonder if i should go to a ne urgently because i might really have something serious okay okay fine now just another question have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs anything like that no no no and when you're walking you're able to walk fine in a straight line or is your your walk are you walking a bit funny uh not really okay it's really about the head that's why i find it very weird okay so okay so just just to clarify what you said this morning you woke up and then later on the in the morning about four hours ago you developed a headache um you're on the left side of the head yes left side of the head exactly behind the eye sorry is it behind the eye is that where the pain is uh no no it's i don't know how to describe it but it's just like um you've said it from gil okay that's fine you've noticed that your vision is blurry there's funny lines you feel a bit nauseous you've vomited twice um yes and you're feeling dizzy as well but you've you've got no neurological symptoms you're walking fine um and and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped is it okay yeah so it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine is that something you've heard of before no it's the first time okay but i'm very familiar with the disease because my mother has it so well but i never had it and i thought that the onset of migraine will be you know in much early ages so that's why i'm not sure if migraines make sense okay so usually with migraines they can present at different times in people's lives so sometimes they can present as a child sometimes they can present when they're older and sometimes they can present you know even postmenopausally so there's different there's different ways you can get migraines and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head typical of a migraine you've got blurry vision again which is very typical with the nausea and vomiting that's also typical of a migraine now um the obviously if the headache is headache is really severe and i'll suggest some medications you can try if that doesn't work we would want to see you um as soon as possible to do like a full neurological exam as well oh that's great to make sure that you know there's you know when we do a more specific examination that everything all that everything all seems fine i would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you if you can take some medications maybe something like ibuprofen okay so and you're you're saying that if this is a migraine and if i try that medication this should go away kind of today so yes a migraine yeah not you know even sooner than that we can look at maybe half an hour to 40 minutes minutes depending on what your response to it is for some people whatever medications they take the migraine doesn't improve and it can last from anywhere from four hours to 72 hours migraines can last okay that doesn't sound good no so what there's lots of medication treatment so there can be ibuprofen with an anti-sickness so and which you can get from the pharmacy um and you also to drink a sugary um carbonated drink something like coke okay so the three of them is a is a good sort of cocktail to start them then we can go up the treatment ladder you can get specific migraine leave medication and that's just something to try between now and when we see you to do the um to do the assessment okay assessment where we can see you today at some point okay um but however if you do take these medications and but however if you do take these medications and you know by the time your appointment time comes and you feel much better in yourself you can cancel it um you can give us a call and cancel it okay sounds good yeah okay some sons of a friend any any questions for me uh no thank you very much you were very helpful all right okay any any further problems between now and your appointment please do let us know okay yeah thank you very much okay bye bye
