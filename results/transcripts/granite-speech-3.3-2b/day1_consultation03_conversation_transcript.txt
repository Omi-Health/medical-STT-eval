and is it moving anywhere else at all no but it's worse when i move okay is that when you move your neck well like if i lean forward or like move my head or neck yeah the headache gets worse okay um i'm just really worried like i've just been googling and like i've read you know if your headache gets worse when you move it could be a sign of brain cancer okay is that what you're worried about yeah is that what your main worry is today oh yeah yeah and i've like you know my my friend's mum she she recently died of a of a brain tumor so it's really concerning me actually my dear i'm sorry to hear that i can i can understand why it's affecting you um but why why do we why do we take a good history first and let me examine you and then we can have a little chat afterward examine you and then we can have a little chat afterward and see what's going on here so you mentioned a few things you mentioned headaches you also mentioned some zigzag lines before the headaches came on and your vision has been blurry as well is that right is that on both eyes or just a left left eye it feels like it's on both both eyes okay have you had any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all yeah well i'm wearing i'm wearing sunglasses it's right now just you know light's really curtaining my eyes i'll see okay and you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous have you vomited at all yeah vomited twice twice okay this earlier today okay any temperatures or fevers no i don't feel feverish any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed i haven't noticed anything like that okay um fine um and do you normally get headaches um not really prone to them no no but i did i did have a similar headache a few weeks ago okay and what happened then just similar how long did it last for a couple of days did future my career you know yeah i was really worried about this never had headaches like this before like why should we get now yeah sure and i can see your concerns obviously there's a lot there's a lot of worry there um but you know let let let's take it step by step um and see exactly what the causes of these headaches are first um i'm just going to ask you some um very yes no questions that's okay um um have you noticed any problems with your speech at all any difficulty with your words any problems with your arms and legs for example numbness or weakness any difficulty with balance your balance or coordination any okay and have you had any injuries to your head have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head no okay all right or um your breathing is okay you're not feeling breathless or no okay um do you have any other medical history i should be aware of no no so for example have you had anyone told you've had migraines in the past no no okay do you do my mum my mum has has migraines but i've i'm not diagnosed right so my next question was about family history is there anything in the family so apart from migraines is anything else anything related to the brain for example hypertension as well what was that sorry and then man has an underactive thyroid as well okay um okay any other problems for example the brain or um you mentioned brain cancer any other family history of that no no okay um in terms of medications do you take anything on a regular basis i take the pill microgynon okay and how long have you been on that for three months three months okay and is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else it's for contraception okay all right that's something we may have a little discussion about today as well um uh my next question was about um well my next question was about your social your situation at home you mentioned you work in the fashion industry is your work is your job quite stressful at the moment yeah it's really stressful actually having problems with like people at work you know managers like putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver and oh yeah it's not a good time is it getting you down i don't feel down just feel a bit stressed okay all right and what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally nothing really do you do much in the way of exercise no okay um who's at home with you um i live on my own okay um are you coping okay at the moment fine yeah okay do you smoke at all smoke all so and do you drink much in the way of alcohol okay all right um so now about this i'd like to kind of proceed to examination um that's um based on your story um i wonder whether you may may have a migraine migraine type headache uh it sounds um very classical of that nature the headache on one side throbbing nature the nausea vomiting sensitive to bright lights i'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious such as meningitis or indeed brain cancer i know that was a big worry of yours initially you are well thanks so much i was so worried that i had cancer and now you say migraine yeah i guess my mum had similar symptoms to me and yeah yeah it doesn't make sense well i hope that pushes your you know emotions day and some strong painkillers would be advisable so we can either think about paracetamol or even cocodamol and some anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen and naproxen how does that sound to you okay that sounds good and you know if your headaches words become more persistent then we can maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place something you know prophylactic medicines okay then we can have a discussion next time i'll see you next week perhaps okay um and a couple of things i want you to think about is you know if your symptoms aren't getting you better in next two three days or indeed are getting worse i'd like you to come back and see me straight away if possible so if your headache is getting worse and not responding to medications or your you know neck pain is getting worse or neck pain is getting worse or you're developing any weakness in your arms and legs or your vision then i'm going to come back and see me straight away okay okay does that sound all okay doctor that's great great any questions for me no thank you okay have a good day thanks bye
