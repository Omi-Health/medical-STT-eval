hello hello there hello can you hear me okay yes i can hear you okay great are you a doctor i am yes dr seud here oscar um how can i help you this afternoon um i'm contacting you because i've been quite short of breath lately okay do okay you can tell me a bit more about when it did all start uh well it seems to have been slowly getting worse over the last couple of weeks um it's become quite troublesome in the last few days uh i kind of normally i can walk to the shops without a problem but now i'm having to sort of sit down and catch my breath and i'm even starting to get a bit breathless just about the house and it's got me kind of worried don't really know what's going on okay okay is there anything you're particularly worried about um well i've uh i've got um heart failure okay uh i was told that uh a while ago um and i got a bit breathless when i was first diagnosed right and put on some medication right and put on some that's that um that helped but i'm a bit worried it's just getting worse right okay so you mentioned you've been feeling short of breath for the last couple of weeks but maybe the last couple of days it's got a bit worse and you're now feeling more breathless on kind of minimal minimal exertion you mentioned have you noticed any other symptoms at all uh with your breath so for example any pain in your chest no pain in my chair okay have you found yourself coughing at all i've got a bit of a dry cough but it's not too troublesome okay okay and how's your general health otherwise are you feeling weak lethargic i'm feeling a little run down but otherwise otherwise pretty normal i've noticed my ankles have gotten bigger okay what do you mean by that uh it's just like it's sort of swollen up a bit okay um is that is that both ankles yeah both ankles yeah it's a bit embarrassing can imagine yeah um and again over how long has this have you noticed this for um i kind of noticed it the last few days last few days okay and this is something that you've had before in the past uh i think my ankles did swell up a bit last time the heart failure was a problem okay okay um fine okay so um just to really recap so really in the last couple of weeks you've been feeling breathless but worse in the last couple of days you mentioned you had a bit couple of days you mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough and some swelling in your ankles but importantly no chest pain and and have you had you have you noticed your heart beating racing at all so palpitations or skipped heartbeats no not really okay and any temperatures or fevers no okay and how about your appetite are you eating and drinking okay yeah i'm that's fine okay and your water works are you passing urine okay uh yeah that's yeah i use the p-l-o-t yeah the drugs sure okay all right um fine so moving on to your your past medical history you mentioned heart failure any any other medical history i should be aware of uh well i was i told i had like uh they called it like a small heart attack about five years ago um i uh i had i had like some chest pain and they took me to hospital okay and um they uh but then i just got better okay i would when you say small heart attack did they give you a name for what happened a name of a diagnosis uh i can't remember they just called it something like that a small heart attack it was like angina or um uh no they said they it seemed it was like more than angina okay um uh but um i didn't but i only had to stay in hospital for a few days and okay um and yeah i've been okay thank you sir you've um and yeah i've been okay since that you've been okay since then okay all right so apart from the uh the heart the heart problems the heart failure any other problems i should be aware of uh no i think i'm otherwise i'm okay thank you um do you take any regular medications apart from your diuretics that you're taking do you know which ones yeah i take something called furosemide what else are you doses you're taking i can't remember i'm sorry doctor i have to check no problems um any other medications uh yeah i take aspirin and uh zopril is that metrol or the connection is not very good okay thank you yep um and if uh silverston with that in ok all right any allergies at all any medications no no allergies okay and is there anything in the family that's uh that's uh that's important for me to know any family history of medical problems heart problems lung problems uh my my father died of a of a heart attack i'm sorry to hear that um how old was your father when he passed away uh he was um early still living okay all right um and so should i just tell me a bit more about your situation at home who lives at home with you uh i live on my own i got two cats i've got two cats okay great do they have names they're my family uh they're they're called um they're called polly and tim okay um so this is junior cats and um in terms of day to day are you working at the moment uh i work part-time as a uh lorry driver okay and how is that that quite stressful long hours uh it's okay um i uh yeah like when i'm working it's pretty exhausting um i guess i'm a bit worried that if i get sick i won't if i get more sick then i won't be able to work properly yeah oh no i i i only take shifts during the day i don't like working at night okay all right and what about smoking and alcohol so because it can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems do you do you smoke at all not anymore so you used to smoke yeah and how many did you smoke a day on average oh it was about about a pack a day back in the day and how many how many years was that for oh that was for good 25 years okay so well done for stopping i must have been very difficult for you at well done for stopping um and what about alcohol i don't drink alcohol okay do you do much in the way of exercise though uh i try and watch the shops at least once a day um but uh that's about it i yeah i don't i don't go running like i used to when i was young right okay and certainly now your symptoms you you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the st to the shop you said um right so um based on your based on your history and having listened to your story i wonder whether you've had a bit of a flare up of your heart failure sir um which can sometimes happen um and you know it's what's going on so i see that your heart's not pumping as well as it should be um and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure there's obviously um it's the first thing that comes to my mind um now there's a couple of options to move forward um given that you're otherwise well at the moment and having examined you your and having examined you your chest and your saturations and blood pressure all okay i'm quite happy to increase your dose of frusemide maybe rather than one tablet a day we can give you two tablets a day for the first few days and see and see how you're getting on okay if you think that would be better i think it's definitely worth treating your symptoms but what we should also think about is maybe doing a maybe doing a couple of other tests like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart see how well your heart's pumping okay is that something you've had of that yeah so an echo scan it's a jelly scan of your heart you may have had it done before when you were diagnosed and it's just to get a good one remember now sorry yeah two weeks for that to be organized but i think certainly in the meantime let's let's let's get a blood test done we can check your you know your full blood count look for signs of anemia we can have a check of your kidney function and we can definitely increase your um your furosemide to you know one tablet twice a day but i really like would like you come back and see me in about a week's time to see how you're getting on does that sound reasonable i think that sounds like a unreasonable i think that sounds like a good plan and of course in the meantime if you are getting more unwell so if you're getting more breathless or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness then you know say i want you to give me a call sooner than that and we can have a chat on the phone as well okay i'll see how i get on okay if you have any questions for me uh that's all pretty clear thank you very much doctor great now i'll wish you all the best have a good day see you soon okay thank you
