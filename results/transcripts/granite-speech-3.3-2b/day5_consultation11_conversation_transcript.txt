hi hi there it's dr smith from babylon hi there hi can you confirm your name date of birth and your home address please yes my name is john date of birth is january first nineteen eighty and my address is sixty sloan avenue london okay are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today absolutely what can i do for you so a couple of things i think i may have overdone my workouts and now my knees are hurting and they're clicking a lot and it's starting to worry me um i can't run very far um any more without just feeling pain in my knees and then sometimes i also get this weird tingling in my toes um so yeah that's that's it i'm just concerned and i and then i figured you know i'd call and see if you can help me figure out what's going on okay that's fine so when do you think it started so probably it's been about two weeks okay um and any joint problems before that you know not not really i mean i play a lot of sports um and i had a like i play some ice hockey and i had coke and i had this injury a few months ago you know i just like fell on the ice and and you know had a huge bruise but i think that's about it okay so um at the moment just tell me about the exercise that you're doing normally so i'm training well i'm currently training for a marathon um that's going to happen in june and so i'm trying i'm trying to run like i mean right now i'm actually not even doing such long runs maybe like seven or eight miles and so i started about uh maybe a month ago uh i've been like you know four or five miles and i've just done like a couple of seven mile runs and then uh and then you know i go to the gym like three times a week and kind of do my usual routine um but yeah i think yeah i think the only thing that's really different has have been the runs the longer runs and have you had any times when the knee feels like it's giving way underneath you um well i what do you mean by that i'm not sure what it means so it means if you're if you're there and you just feel it sort of jolt like give way feel unstable underneath you not that i mean it just kind of starts hurting you know um and does it hurt uh how far into the run does it generally hurt you know i would say it probably starts like after uh maybe 20 minutes or so which is probably i don't know like somewhere around mile three maybe two and a half or three miles okay oh you're fast maybe i'm switching my kilometers and miles i'm not sure i'm sorry and um do you have to stop running or can you run through the pain yeah that is a good question so um you know the last few times the last time actually stopped i mean i ran a little bit longer but then i stopped because it was um i feel like it's getting worse um and when i start doing my apps that you know when i do my apps it kind of require me to move my that you know when i do my abs it kind of require me to move my you know um to kind of go from the flex position of my knees and straighten my legs then i hear all this clicking okay and i think that also freaked me out and i just figured you know something you said before it's both knees so it's more um it's actually my right knee that hurts um any problems with your left one no okay can you just describe in the knee or showing me whereabouts the pain is happening mind me so you know i feel it it's kind of weird i feel it in the middle but i almost feel like maybe kind of a um moves to the right to the right of my knee a little bit okay have you noticed any tenderness when you press over any areas in the knee so yes well it's i have probably some fluid i googled it and you know it says that sometimes the fluid accumulates okay does it look swollen to you sorry does the knee look swollen um well it did like the first time i ran it was a little bit swollen but then i just put some like ice on it and it went away um but right now right now it's not swollen and right now it doesn't hurt you know um but it just kind of you know um but it just kind of comes on when uh um or you know right now when i flex and extend my leg it there's no clicking but i'll notice it in the gym and then you know when i run it will start hurting okay and if you're sitting still for a while do you have any problems when you stand up any locking up of the knee no can't straighten it any problems going up and downstairs no any problems with walking normally no no i don't and in terms of range of movement are you able to fully straighten the leg yes and what about fully flex it yes okay are you taking any medication for the knee well um since you're asking um yes i i take ibuprofen um and i'll just kind of use it sometime like uh um like sometimes i have some joint issues but you know that kind of is not very frequent so i'll take ibuprofen for that but you know it's nothing like major maybe like 400 milligrams max something like that i also sometimes will um you know smoke a joint um and yeah other than that that's it okay and any other joint problems that you're getting any back pain small swelling of your hands feet elbows wrists any pain uh well i have sometimes you know how sometimes like if you stand for a long time your feet will kind of or your legs will swell up like i noticed it because of my socks i'll just kind of notice this inflammation and then another weird thing i felt this just once but there was this just once but there was this tingling in my toes like after the run there was tingling in my toes like on my you know my right toes so on your right side yes any change in color or temperature of your lower legs any swelling which stays if you push in and then you release it it stays there well i don't know if i really try that but i i will tell you that what i really try that but i will tell you that what i notice is like if i you know when my socks come off i kind of notice that indentation a little bit i mean it's not like major right but i i mean do you mean i just need to like press and see what happens if it like kind of stays or yeah any any pain in the back of the calf or anything like that no nothing like that and with your foot has that gone back to normal now do you feel any any altered sensation tingling numbness anything like that no it was just it was that time uh but it was just really weird because it kind of went on for a while okay and any pain in the joints of your foot or on the underside in the arch any problems walking around on hard floors no okay have you had any other medical problems before uh well i had uh you know just need to give me morphine um that was kind of an awful experience but uh other than that you know i'm i'm i'm pretty good okay do you take any other medications apart from the ones you told me about well i'll take uh i take vitamin d uh i take melatonin sometimes you know just for cramps i'll take like um ibuprofen or actually acetaminophen i'll take what i'm am i taking a leave whatever i leave is i think that's maybe um a setaminofen or i can't remember what class of drugs you know occasionally if i'm really having hard times like i'll i'll sleeping i'll take xanax um but i prefer melatonin it's just sometimes melatonin doesn't work okay and any problems with your stomach or asthma indigestion i have problems um what um what i would suggest is definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using so as much as you can because that really does make a difference to injuries bring some of the healing blood into the area and it gives it the best chance of getting better so as much as you can use the ice um obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon program but um i would try and ease up on the running if you can and if it's painful enough that you're having to stop running then it's not a good idea to do that it's fine to take the ibuprofen i can prescribe you a slightly stronger anti-inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the ibuprofen but not with the ibuprofen but make sure to take it with food ultimately we probably need to examine the knee so the best thing i would suggest getting an appointment with a physiotherapist first who can do like a long assessment and examination of the knee and then make an assessment as to whether we need to do any imaging to have a look inside the knee and see if there's any problem with the cartilage well you know i read i read some stuff online that that maybe like my ligaments there's i think it's like acl i think it's like aco or something like that right and so if that i mean i'm kind of like freaked out that that may break so do you think it's that or um it's it's not really possible to diagnose that over the pho over the video so we definitely would need to see you um the ophthalmologist is the best point of call because that would probably be the most likely initial treatment but certainly the appointment time is too long the appointment time's too long to wait then we can see we can see you in as well can you so are you going to send referral for that yeah we can we can do referral for that if in the meantime you develop like persistent swelling heat redness um if the knee or high temperature feel unwell or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it then you need to see a doctor urgently so call us back -ack it in that case that's good thank you yes please sure i mean give me the stronger meds and i'll give that a try okay i'll send it through to a pharmacy for you okay thanks so much bye
