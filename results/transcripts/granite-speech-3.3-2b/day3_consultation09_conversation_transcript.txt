hi hello hi i'm dr jacob and welcome to babylon hello hi hi so um just before we start is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please sure my name is mary smith and your date of birth my date of birth is august 16th 1976 and your email address for me please my email address is marysmith at gmailcom that's correct and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation absolutely all right so you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw is that correct um well i think that's just like the first thing that i typed but uh it wasn't really what i you know i just typed it and then i clicked submit submit so that was a um i mean it's part of the problem but i would say that more of a problem for me is that i can't quite move my left arm i mean i can move it but it's it's numb and then i also feel some like tingling in my fingertips okay so not missing the left arm yeah yes how long has it been going on for so i've started taking this boxing class i've been taking a boxing class for a few weeks and i feel like maybe it's probably been i'd say for at least two weeks and it's kind of gotten worse like at the beginning i just kind of felt a little bit of tingling and then it's gotten it's gotten worse since then then the numbing kind of started i can feel it both in my you know a you know a little bit in my elbow and then in my arm as well as in my hand and now because it hasn't gotten better i tried to get a massage it's not better or you know tried to take warm baths it's not better so i figured i'd call you and and just figure out what's going on right so have you mentioned a massage and a warm bath any medications that you've taken so far um well it's you know it's numb and i kind of looked stuff online but you know i do take ibuprofen just because my muscles were sore a little bit and i've been taking this boxing class so you know i kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand so that's been a little bit painful so i've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that but like i said i mean i tried massage i tried some hot baths and that didn't help with this numbness thing sure i'm just kind of getting a little worried of course you've just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards it's that you know the tingling numbness is elbow below not from your shoulder um well it's kind of funny you know sometimes i will feel it in my shoulder like if i will feel it in my shoulder like if i try to if i try to like you know move like in boxing and stuff i will even like maybe feel a little bit of a little bit of pain but i would say if i'm just like resting if if i'm sitting like right now i can feel like it's numb and i actually feel tingling right now not in all of my fingers but just in some yeah so which fingers do you feel numb okay so it's my second third and fourth finger and is it your palm side or you know the back of your hand side which is numb or both no it's it's the it's this side so the front side it's the front side okay right and have you been dropping things at all like you know when you try to hold on to things like a glass or something have you dropped it so not so much so not so much with the glass but i will say um well i play a little bit of a piano and so i just noticed that it's it's been kind of harder to get the notes i can i can grasp i can grasp a a glass but because i use my right hand most of the time you know i'm not left-handed so i it's kind of hard for me too so you would say there's a mild weakness mild yes so the just so the just to get my facts right so you it's definitely weakness rather than because of the pain you can't hold it there's two different things so you know sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you no no it's not hurting it's not hurting it's like numb i can't feel it right okay yeah fine so you have definitely having some sort some form of weakness okay any neck pain at all no no no neck pain okay right okay so just a bit more of a background because i don't have much information on the system do you have any past medical history that you'd like to share well i guess because of this you know i'm not sure if it's boxing i also had a really bad cold like a month ago i mean i was out you know drinking with the friends one of our co-workers just had his three year anniversary and we kind of went crazy and we were like out partying ago is like i all of a sudden just couldn't see from the uh for my left eye like i i lost some like a little bit of a field of vision um and but that that just lasted not very long i mean that just lasted maybe for i don't know 20 20 minutes uh and i kind of thought i don't know maybe it was the the cold you know and the virus and all that so yeah i guess that's what i can you know that's the last thing that's what i can you know that's the last thing i can remember but in general i'm i'm pretty healthy i mean i you know i work out what and i i don't really have any medical problems do you have any headaches at all from the in the recent past uh sometimes i get headaches but i think they're just tired headaches you know sometimes i'll get kind of tired but i think that's probably because i work too much or you know because like i'll go for a workout and then i'll really just exhaust myself a workout and then i'll really just exhaust myself and then i just kind of feel this fatigue or sometimes like this morning for example i just felt really fatigued and i couldn't even get myself to the gym but you know since i have this numbness it's kind of like hard to work out right do you wear glasses at all glasses contact lenses no no so no glasses right and you've not had experienced anything like a seizure fit anything like that what's a seizure like when you lose consciousness and you start shaking oh no no no nothing like that no freaking yeah okay and your weakness is only in your left arm leg walking and all this normal yeah yeah walking is normal yeah you mentioned for a while you couldn't see couldn't see you know the outside peripheral vision from your left eye how long did that episode last for you know i think it was only maybe like 20 minutes or so it's almost like it happened and i thought oh my god it's probably i'm still like sick from this you know virus thing cold and so i just kind of slept it off and then when i uh when i woke up it was gone sure okay so is there any regular medications that you're using not really i just take ibuprofen every once in a while i take vitamin d um i take some i i like my my gp really wants me to take iron supplements but you know there are these like huge bills so i i most of the time i just forget but vitamin d i take all right and any family history you'd like to share any significant family history i know that my dad has i don't know if it's hypo i think it's hypothyroidism yeah and then my like he's got some autoimmune stuff going on like that much i know and then my mom she's she's actually not in a great shape she's got diabetes type 2 she's got hypertension um she's got gosh what is it oh yeah she's got high cholesterol um and i think that's it for her yeah right any neurological conditions in the family uh there are there related conditions now okay that's fine so okay so yeah so after you know speaking and examining you know yourself on there i think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further i'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the box in here a few things that made me think other than just like a boxing injury is for instance um you know when you said you can't your vision went paralysis was not there for about 20 so and that with the weakness of the arms make me think is there something else going on rather than just injury what do you think may be going on sometimes you know you do get things like ms multiple sclerosis so people autoimmune sclerosis can have visual problems like what you've experienced and sometimes you know the odd numbness tingling sensations going on okay will i be in wheelchair if we catch it a bit early there are treatments for it okay i'm not obviously i'm not suggesting that you do have it but it is quite important to find out that whether you have it or not that's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be dealt with here yeah so what we do is i'm going to do an urgent very urgent neurology referral yeah what this might entail is a brain scan and things like that hello i see yeah yeah i'm here i'm here i know this it might sound a bit of a shock to you um but i but i think it is important that we investigate this a bit more seriously all right yeah that makes sense okay any questions at all but what's okay so you're gonna do the referral um should i be taking any drugs or no that's something we can't do the treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that when you have an acute you know acute reaction or things like that but saying that first we need to adopt firm diagnosis yeah while you're waiting for this to be done if there's any weakness you know if the weakness progresses to your legs or there's any kind of headaches vomiting fits and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better then that would be an ane okay got it all right okay thank you doctor yeah i'm sorry i i do appreciate you are a bit worried but you know it's good that you know that you've come and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling okay thank you doctor appreciate your time that's okay you take care bye bye now bye
