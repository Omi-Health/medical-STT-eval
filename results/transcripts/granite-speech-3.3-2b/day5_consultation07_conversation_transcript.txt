pretty good right okay so just tell me about the last did you say five days yeah five days or so ago okay how bad is your cough at the moment uh it's quite bad it's kind of quite dry um i'm coughing maybe every 20 30 minutes or so okay you bring any upflammata no no any chest pain chest what sorry any pain in your chest no no any difficulty breathing feeling short of breath or any pain when you take a deep breath no that's all fine have you coughed up any blood or anything like that and what about your nose symptoms or any frontal sinuses or anything and nothing up in here but just constant streaming like using a million tissues or any blood coming from the nose no it's pretty green right okay any other symptoms like sore ears sore throat i had i've been feeling really hot um i don't know if it's fever as such but i'm like to touch i'm quite hot but sometimes i'm feeling really chilly needing to be under a blanket that sort of thing i've checked your temperature with a thermometer no i haven't okay um and are you eating and drinking normally yes kind of around when it started i had some diarrhea but i don't know if that was associated but since then it's all been pretty fine okay so you're drinking well holding down fluids okay that's fine um any rashes that you've noticed rashes yeah uh no nothing like that any headaches or change in your vision no um i've had quite achy muscles but that's pretty much it okay and normally do you have any chest problems uh no do you ever get wheezing short of breaths uh i mean like if i do intense exercise and yes but not and do you regularly have any infections in your chest or anything that needs treatment normally no uh i've got hypertension um i'm on some drugs for that um but that's it okay um any other medical problems uh just the hypertension and the diabetes okay and what type of drugs are you on i think something called metformin and listerpril i think is the other one okay when did you last have your blood pressure checked a while ago do you know if your blood with your diabetes have you had a blood test recently um yeah like yeah it was normal it was around three weeks ago okay and do you know what dose of the lisinopril you're taking uh 200 okay have you been able to pass water normally any increase in frequency that you're passing water or any increased thirst no not particularly and has your weight been stable yes what is your weight and height my height is five foot five and my weight is 65 kilograms okay and do took you drink any alcohol yes the odd sherry okay and who do you live with at home uh my partner and my dog and do you work uh yes i'm an office manager okay and have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms anything that you've bought in the a chemist um quite a few lemsips um it seems to be open do you what do you mean by quite a few how many in in a day do you normally take or maybe two or three maybe like at the start of the day and at the end of the day okay have you noticed any improvement in that yeah it tends to soothe my throat a bit when i'm going to sleep okay um do you have any allergies to anything uh i sometimes suffer from like hay fever um but it's not from any any allergies to any medications at all not that i'm aware of now okay so what you've described to me it sounds like you you probably have got an infection in the chest um because it's it you know you obviously getting the symptoms of from your nose and your from your nose and your chest um it sounds like you might have a high temperature it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature okay i can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something yeah um most of the time these infections are caused by viruses so they do normally settle by themselves but it can take you know a week or two um and you can consistently have the cough ongoing longer than that the important thing to do would be to take your temperature and if you feel like if the temperature is ongoing above 30 75 38 and you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down or your cough's getting worse you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out of your nose or any shortness of breath chest pain then we certainly would need to speak to you again with the diabetes you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes so it's something that we do need to be cautious of okay so then we would look at potentially antibiotics at that time perhaps yeah potentially yeah potentially if it is if it's not settling or the temperature is ongoing getting worse then we definitely need to talk to you again okay um have you got any other questions um no that's all fine it's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment with the lemsip i wouldn't take and that's that contains prosecal so don't take any other paracetamol containing products um with that at the same time um the at the same time the cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime it's best for your body if you just keep coughing but if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all then it's okay to have a little bit of cough syrup just to settle that down okay okay yes you have blood sugar checking equipment do you check not at home no okay well if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your gpa's uh ask you for yeah okay great all right then take care all right thanks very much bye
