mornings really difficult and i don't have much energy at all during the day um often yeah just like doing most things that i would normally find easy is become quite difficult okay so things have become quite difficult for you yeah is there anything else um it's hard to say like things like i'm not not eating very much at the moment i just don't feel like i have a lot of energy okay i'm sorry to hear that um so you've had you've had difficulty waking up no energy not eating and that's been going on for a few weeks when you say a few weeks do you mean two or three or five now i can just think about it maybe maybe even longer i guess might be related to it so i also started a new job slightly recently it might have even coincided with uh with that job a couple of months ago when did you start your new job two months ago to see yeah okay and um so this has been going on perhaps for um sort of six weeks or so more like two months i would say yeah okay all right so um is there anything that you're particularly sort of concerned about um or hoping to get out of this consultation well um i i know that it's not really normal for me so before this phase side happening you know i wouldn't have uh any problems sort of eating what i want to eat or you know doing standard you know doing standard things in life and and what i want to do is to like kind of return to that previous state uh somehow um i'm not sure how that is uh what what the best ways of doing that are but yeah give some advice or whatever that'd be really useful okay sure okay um well what what i'd like to do is just to ask you a few more sort of questions around what's been going on um and also around your background health on and also around your background health and things like that and then we can go on to sort of what can be done from there is that all right okay okay great so you say you've been feeling unwell with not a lot of energy difficult waking up in the mornings do you tend to just on that note do you tend to wake up early and then stay in bed in the mornings i i'd say uh i i kind of um yeah uh finding it really hard to quite difficult to focusing i would say um not unhappy or happy but just uh quite just not focused okay so difficulty focusing quite distracted and would you say you've been in good spirits or is your mood low um actually uh now you you mentioned it like my mood is a bit lower recently um and so i've noticed my sex drive has kind of decreased um a bit over the the past few months as well so yeah and uh so lower mood decreased sex drive recently as well and just on that note just a few questions around that are you able to uh maybe slightly personal questions but if you're okay to answer these do you tell to to have morning erections like you is that something that you've noticed i haven't noticed anything like that specifically so you've not so you're saying you have not noticed morning erections and usually you would it's a normal thing to have uh waking up in the morning with something but you have not noticed those recently i have not noticed those recently okay and that's been a change has it um important one i don't think um sorry yeah i don't think it's an important change no i so you don't think there's been a change there no there hasn't been a change there oh okay sorry right so okay so um just going back to the mood symptoms as well uh you've had difficulty focusing easily distracted your mood has been uh slightly lower with lower sex drive yeah um and in what way is your sex drive been lower are you in a relationship at the moment yeah i i'm married um i've been for for many years and yeah just um over the last few months just uh been disinterested disinterested okay sorry you froze there for a moment um so less interested as well okay and just to ask you a few questions before we uh wrap up is uh any significant past medical history um so do you suffer from any uh mental health problems in the past i have a history of hypothyroidism hypo hypothyroidism hypothyroidism yeah so that's hypothyroidism just a sort of confirmation sorry can you say that again please hypo as in hypothyroidism hypo hypo okay hypothyroidism hi poz i would thank you thank you um yeah and uh also in the past i mean i haven't had any kind of specific uh medical diagnoses along these lines um but the suspicion that it may have had an impact on me but my father has committed suicide um about 15 years ago okay okay and um do you take any medications i have a drug history of thyroxine so maybe yes you do so you're taking thyroids in at the moment yes cool and any drug allergies are you allergic to any medications no i have no medication allergies no no allergies and you mentioned the the suicide of your father fifteen years ago i'm very sorry to hear that is there any other significant family history of medical conditions or psychiatric conditions no depression or anything like that running in family or anything like that okay and your mother is is well any brothers or sisters yeah she's fine and now i'm an only child um okay so i just uh sorry my slight roundabout question but any uh change in your vision no no nothing like that no change in your vision okay and just to go back to your you were saying you had low mood some people who are who do have low mood and low sex drive can sometimes feel uh suicidal as well have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else no no no no okay no are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities so i have some kind of like shortness of breath um when i sports compared to maybe a couple of months ago okay so you've become more short of breath over the last few months yeah um and you've had uh okay so uh any other things around there so more fatigue more shortness of breath um over the last few months um with a lower mood decrease sex drive is there just before we wrap up is there anything else that you would like to talk about no nothing's positive yet so getting a little bit towards the end now but i would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you i would like to probably see you in person and and also we would probably like to do some blood tests um as well so do you think it'd be possible to see uh to book an appointment in the next few days uh with your gp or or um that would be ideal i think here um and then we can yes we could probably do some more uh do an examination and and do some investigations really to see what's going on here a little bit more thanks yeah is that all right yeah that's very useful thank you um okay it's better to have some kind of plan yeah yeah yeah i think we i definitely think we need a plan here um it's been nice talking to you sorry we run out of time now but we at least started the ball rolling with um some further investigations and tests i'm glad you're you know you're you're you're although you have a low mood and you're not feeling suicidal just to confirm that and you're and we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some of your tiredness and your other symptoms let me see okay thank you very much for taking the time okay thank you thanks
