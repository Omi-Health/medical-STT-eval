hi there i'm dr smith from babylon hi hi there can you just confirm your name date of birth and the first line of your address first of all please uh my name is valerie paul my date of birth is the nineteenth of september nineteen ninety three my address is uh sixty four cliveden place in south wimbledon okay are you in a private place where you can have a confidential consultation today yes i am yes what can i do for you um i've been feeling really anxious over the past few months um i just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house and it started to really worry me and just add up and build on that anxiety and i just didn't know who who to talk to so i wanted to check with my gp okay do you mind just telling me a bit more about when it started do you think there's something which changed in your life that time i guess so i think i would say maybe about two months or so i've been feeling like this and that probably coincides with me starting starting a new job um which i would say it's quite stress i mean every job is stressful when you first start but it's been really stressful i think over the past two months definitely what's your job um so i work for a uh a fashion retailer in um their head office team and it's just a brand new sector i've never worked in retail before my boss is not very nice to me and but i also think that it's just being i just really dread going there i just hate speaking to her i hate seeing everyone and really worried about whether i'm doing well and all and it's really impacting on like on the rest of my life like my sleep and stuff like that okay so um just day to day tell me from the start of your day how it affects you said you you you dread going to work how does it affect you in terms of like your sleep at night and things like that yeah definitely so i i i as i say like i don't want to go to work in the morning so i just find no way of i can't get out of bed but it's also because when i leave i just when i've left work i just feel so stressed i'm so i'm so worried about everything i've done i can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours okay so what time do you go to bed at nighttime about 10 11 and what time do you get to sleep not for ages i'm i'm lying awake all night okay and when you eventually get to sleep do you wake up with your alarm in the morning or does something else wake you up before then so i find my heart kind of racing and then i'm just like panicking and then i'm just like panicking that i'm going to be late and that that's going to make work even more stressful so i do have an alarm but i find myself waking up before that because i'm just my heart is racing and actually the other day i was just like i was lying in bed and i really thought my heart was racing so much thought i was going to have a heart attack in the morning okay and so how many hours sleep do you think you get a night i just i can't even tell because i feel like i'm even when i'm in sleep it's such a shallow sleep but maybe three four hours i'm getting now okay and what about your eating patterns any change in how you're eating or whether your appetites change probably not significant changes maybe no i wouldn't say that i wouldn't say i mean like much differently oh i probably have more chocolate than normal well just because i feel so down okay you're eating regularly otherwise yeah and you told me about the palpitations just tell me a bit more about that yeah so i'm it's it's usually kind of like when i realize in the morning that either i feel like i'm going to be late because i've like overslept because i'm so tired or i wake up in a panic thinking i'm going to be late so it's just kind of like just a constant like rapid heart beating it's really really stressful i don't know if it's stress or i did think it was like a heart problem initially does it feel like a regular fast beat or an irregular beat irregular i think and how long do you think it lasts for when you get it oh it can be anything i think it oh it can be anything i think it was a couple of minutes or the other day i was actually just sort of lying there for like holding my hand on my chest for like 10 minutes okay is that something that you've had before this or is that a new thing yeah i would say this is only in the past sort of like a couple of months as i say that i've been experiencing this okay any chest pain with that no um well yeah it's painful to when the heart when my heart is being fast but okay but yeah and in the daytime how how you said you you're not getting much sleep so how's your energy level in the daytime it's just really really low i'm finding now that i'm just i find no enjoyment at all kind of day-to-day in anything that i'm doing it's not just my job it's you know when i leave i'm just so tired that anything that previously was really fun is just not it's not enjoyable and i'm like yeah on edge the whole time okay so what do you do in the evenings well right now i i'm working so late everything is really really stressful so i don't really get much time for myself but when i do you want to go out or you know be friends or just relax it it seems quite difficult to do that okay and are you avoiding contact with friends or do you still see them yeah as i say like everything that i had previously been doing has been just difficult to continue with like i did used to like to like go running and um to play tennis and stuff but now it's just not i'm just not enjoying it and not i'm not like i'm not going out to do that quite so much and if is it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work no because i think that would just add to the tension but i wouldn't say so i think i've always managed to make it to work but i i wonder if it's building up so this is why i want to talk so i'm just worried it's building up to that i don't know what to do because i've felt it felt it get worse and worse over the past apart from work are there any other situations which provoke quite extreme anxiety like being in public places social situations public transport anything like that yeah i'm no i would say i mean everybody always has a bit of tension a bit of anxiety but i've never felt anything that's bad before okay and what about your mood day to day i mean i can see that you're quite distressed by it but do you ever get really down about this um i mean yeah yeah because i do yeah i'm pretty much down like i don't enjoy being in my with my day at all because i'm just so worried about everything and i find that even when i'm not like even at the weekends and stuff it's just this kind of like constant feeling of just being a bit down a bit unhappy and when do you think you last felt yourself um i don't know if that's a good question i can't i don't know if that's a good question i can't really i can't really put a dick on that at all and has your mood ever been so low that you felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job or with your life or with your normal things as they were going on i wouldn't no i wouldn't say that i've had i haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any thoughts that have been that extreme like i don't you know i have have a good support system like i do have a good family and like i do have a good family and stuff so i have i don't have worries about actually wanting to um not go on it's just that i don't want to go on like this yeah okay and where do you who do you live with at home sorry who do you live with at home yeah i live with my parents just my parents um and how much alcohol do you have on an average week do you think um i don't know guess probably like probably quite a lot on friday or saturday because it's usually going out so maybe like i probably go over my limit just on those days anyway and then like maybe a glass of wine during the week okay do you smoke or take any other drugs or anything um i try not to smoke but i do occasionally but i don't take okay and have you done anything anything yourself to help have you talked to anyone talked to any counselors done any online looked online at all anyways i talked to my mom because she also suffers from or she's suffered from like depression in the past i didn't think that it was that i was suffering from actual depression because it just seems to be manifesting as as tools as just stress the the whole time but i just talked to my mom and i haven't seen any she recommended that i come to the gp but i haven't seen any other and we should be happy to have some one-to-one therapy yeah i think so i've never done it before but yeah what we would suggest in the first instance is to do so you can self-refer via the nhs for via the nhs for what we call like talking therapy which is type of behavioural therapy where they can really look at your situation how you're reacting to the what's provoking the anxiety and what you can do to try and overcome that so i can send you the link for that in the meantime it can be a bit of a wait there are some online resources that are really helpful put the details on there and you can get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well and if you're feeling like it's not helping at all or your anxiety is getting worse to the point where you can't cope with work or you can't just do your normal things day to day then it's important for us to for you to give us a call back and just discuss that further i mean some people with anxiety they do need to take medication to control that but that's not something that we suggest in the first instance okay and i'll put some more information on your notes about helping with your sleep patterns and things like that that's great i look forward to reading it in terms of the palpitations it is we've seen to be associated with anxiety but it's probably worth having a couple of basic blood tests just to a couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that there's not something triggering that off and then arranging a gp follow-up a week after you've had the test so we can just go through the results with you okay okay yeah so if you call this line you can arrange the to have the blood test done okay i'll call them up okay thank you so much all right take care have a good day sorry to talk to you over
