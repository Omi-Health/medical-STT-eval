hi there it's dr smith from babylon hi there hi can you confirm your name date of birth and your home address please yeah it is and it's 14th of august 1989 and was the last bit your address and it's one babylon avenue and are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today yes what can i do for you and come in i don't really know what's been going on but it's just aching all over but definitely the last six weeks it might have been slightly longer than that but it's just sort of that feeling really tired run down okay um so when do you think you were last well uh well we just started april definitely christmas new year i felt relatively well i think um so since then actually yeah i i was on holiday in um in the states and yeah it probably coincided with sometime around then end of january start then end of january start of february so do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back probably a couple of weeks after i got back were you well when you were on holiday yeah had a great time very active um did you get any infections chest infections diarrhoea vomiting anything like that um no not that i recall um yeah not no the symptoms sort of all started afterwards okay so just tell me what symptoms you've been having in terms of just your general health any persistent cold symptoms or earaches or throat chest cough shortness of breath phlegm anything like that no any change in changing your weight for school um i don't think so i'm probably less hungry but no no weight change are you eating different amounts uh yeah probably slightly smaller portions or it's yeah more of an effort to to actually eat everything that's in front of me any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat or abdominal pain no any change in your bowel habit diarrhea vomiting or blood in the stool no any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine no any other general symptoms like rashes i don't have any rashes now in fact i've got a photo on my phone if that's helpful okay i can try and show you hang on because this yeah this was weird this sort of came up and then disappeared after a couple of weeks where was the light okay yeah whereabouts was it uh i think sort of car back of my car because i didn't notice it my wife noticed it actually when did you first notice it probably around the end of february the middle to end of february and then it like it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time and then it faded over a couple of weeks i guess did you have any fevers at that time um to be honest that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat i had so possibly a little bit out in the on holiday as well but definitely um yeah i mean i don't recall any bites i don't remember seeing anything bitten but you often like yeah as you walking through i was in shorts and and boots but you feel a bit whereabouts were you in the states um just sort of uh near yosemite so okay and any headaches blood exploded vision tingling numbness and you know so the sort of headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy and have you been able to go to work as usual i've been going to work i don't know how effective it's been but yeah and not as much i don't know if it's i haven't been able to or i've just been a bit lazy with it i'm not exercising as much as i would normally okay and um how's your mental health your stress levels i look pretty good at the moment actually like previously that has been an issue but um other than sort of physically feeling a bit crappy i'm yeah in a pretty good place okay apart from that rash any other rashes on your skin or swelling of your joints or pain in your joints yeah sort of aching shoulders back hips knees but sort of any swelling that you've noticed like what hands wrists ankles toes uh no okay um and any other significant medical problems in the past uh i mean asthma and hay fever if they're okay any flowers you've had asthma recently no pretty well controlled do you take any regular inhalers or other medication yeah i've got one of these um preventative i think yeah i've got to take twice a day but i've not used occasionally that was okay and who'd you live with at home just my wife sorry so with this rash we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms and just because of your symptoms which have been ongoing for six weeks that's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels i think it's important to get some blood tests checking all the normal things like liver kidneys blood count etc but also some more specific things like bacterial infection you can sometimes get including one that you can get which can produce a rash like that so that would involve blood tests are you happy to do that yeah and just generally what's the infection well you can get a can get bacterial infection caused if it's called um it's called line ruler that you can get rash from a tick bite so that's something we would do a test for as well and if that comes back it's not that positive then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it so it's definitely worth checking for but we would also check just for other things which can cause reduced energy tiredness and aching for persistent over six weeks okay so if you're happy to do that if you book that through the support line and then when you've had the test arranged a follow-up about a week after you've had the test done okay so do the test first and then and that follow-up we can just do over the phone again yeah yeah we can do that over the phone to start with excellent okay that's really helpful thank you very much oh sorry he broke up a bit there's any other questions oh no not no okay that's great take care thank you thank you bye sorry
