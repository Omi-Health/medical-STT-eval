speak i am yes okay great so how can i help you today um so i kind of woke up this morning and i've just got this really horrible pain on the left side of my head um a real kind of headachey feeling sure okay and um uh did the did the pain wake you up yeah it woke me up um quite early this morning what time do we cure um probably around 530 if and what time do you normally get up um i normally get up at about seven o'clock is the headache still present now yes it is okay have you had this kind of pain before um i mean i've had a bit of a history with headaches but nothing as severe as this before so they were less severe but they're similar in nature in terms of being one-sided and the type of pain not so much on the one side it tends to be a bit of a cluster at the front of my head in a way but this time it's just kind of more prominent on the left side which i've never really had it's normally they kind of spread across the front of my head okay all right and um can i just double check do you have any neck stiffness at all uh no okay and do you have any fever no all right um how are you with bright lights at the moment do you feel sensitive to bright lights okay um i'm a little bit sensitive it just it kind of makes my eyes a little bit sore but nothing that i can't really handle okay and can i just double check um are you feeling nauseous at all um not really like when i first got up this morning my head felt a bit dizzy but that's kind of subsided now and it seems to be fine okay um and um can i just double check does anyone in your family have any migraines or have they been diagnosed with migraines uh no if they haven't okay um and um are you under any particular stress at the moment um work's kind of um a um work's kind of um a bit stressful in the moment i've got a lot going on um yeah i just seem to have like a lot of kind of a backlog of work that i need to go through at the moment so i've kind of been doing a lot of late nights as well right okay um and um how long has that been the case for uh probably about a couple of months now um how would you say your mood is i'm not like moody i'm not angry or i get a bit frustrated during the day but it kind of ebbs and flows every now and then but yeah okay do you have have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression or stress in the past i've had so i had like anxiety for about two years now and i've been on uh search relief for a while okay are you taking search relief at the moment yes okay um and how do you feel in terms of anxiety at the moment do you feel anxious at all no not necessarily at work sometimes i do feel a bit anxious um i i kind of just the panic of not being able to get my work done on time but other than that i don't feel massively anxious now sorry to ask this just to ask this for anyone suffering from anxiety have you have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself no now with regards to this headache is it worse when you lie down or is it is it better when you lie down when i lay when i lay down like it kind of feels a little bit sore at first and it takes me a while to get comfortable so yeah at the beginning it does but then again that just kind of soothes a little bit okay so would you say ultimately it's better when you lie down yeah i would say so okay and in terms of this headache since this morning have you taken anything for it yet i've taken some paracetamol does that help not really no okay do you have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure no have you ever had your blood pressure checked no okay um and are there any illnesses in your family um no there's nothing my parents uh my mom's had a history of anxiety as well but no kind of like physical illnesses or anything like that okay all right and um no other other than search for leena and having taken um paracetamol this morning um nothing else do you have any allergies to any medication not that i'm aware of no and and are you living by yourself at the moment or you living with someone else um i live with my partner okay are you a smoker no okay and uh do you have any pets at home uh i have a cat okay and can i have a cat okay and can i just tell you how much exercise would you do normally a week so normally i try to go running at least three times a week okay and what's your diet like um it's okay um it's nothing it's nothing um really healthy um but it's fine okay i wish that's unhealthy all right um now um in terms of this headache uh obviously i haven't been able to examine you or see you directly but um it sounds like it might be one of two things it could be an element of what we call tension headache okay that's one possibility um and what makes that more likely is the fact that you've been under some pressure and you've got a history of anxiety in the past okay um the other possibility is uh migraine as as well okay um and the fact what makes that more likely is the fact that it's on one side and that you've got some sensitivity to light okay okay so what what i think we can do is um i think we can give you some um generic pain relief that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches okay so i'll take your please in a second and the other thing that i was going to suggest is we maybe look explore things to try and decrease the stress from work so okay um the medication wise the things that we'd start off first line if someone had migraines would would be to start ibuprofen and uh uh that the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses of ibuprofen so that's one thing we can start you can keep on taking paracetamol if you like but the ibuprofen is actually more effective for for migraine and oh right um actually more effective for migraine and oh right um yeah so the the guidelines have changed recently we we before that we used to give prescription ones first line but now it's um over-the-counter aspirin that's okay the other thing i'd like to do is maybe consider taking some time off work okay because if that's due to stress from work um maybe having a week off if you're self-certified that might help with things and i'd also like you to explore counselling options as well counseling options as well so there's a counseling service in your area that i can give you the link for if you want to self-refer i'd like to try that um what we're going to do is we'll have a follow-up in a week's time as well as those two things other things i'd like you to do is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of 7 to 8 hours sleep at night every night okay a minimum of 15 to 2 liters of water or fluids a day and that's not including coffee or tea okay all right because sometimes dehydration and you know fatigue can be causes of headaches as well um i didn't realize that yeah so that that is um you know we need to rule those things out um let's let's try that okay um let's have a follow-up appointment if we're finding that things are not getting better we might need to arrange some blood tests or look at other possibilities but we'll try that in the first instance if anything changes in the meantime or you get worried or things get worse feel free have a low threshold for ringing us back and booking an appointment and we can reassess the situation okay yeah that sounds brilliant thank you so much for your help okay no problem so there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes and i'll also leave a link to some of the dangers signs and symptoms of headaches in the notes if you can read through that in the notes if you can read through that in your own time that'll just help you to have a bit more control over what's going on and understanding of what kind of things should trigger you contacting another doctor okay that's perfect thank you so much for your help no problem okay so we'll we'll touch base in a week's time with me or myself or one of the other doctors and we could all take it from there okay okay thank you yeah i'll book an appointment in um yeah in that time brilliant okay all right take care of yourself thank you andrew bye bye
