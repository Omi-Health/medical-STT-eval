hi there good morning um i'm dr dean moser from babylon yeah uh can you hear me okay can you find me yeah okay great well nice to see this morning um before we start your appointment could i confirm your full name and date of birth please yeah uh jack smith uh thirty first october nineteen ninety that's perfect thank you jack um are you in that's perfect thank you jack um are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment um yes okay great so um tell me what's been going on you've you've been saying there's a problem with your hearing is that right yes i just feel like i can't really hear as well as i used to like my hearing's kind of deteriorating in some way right okay how long has this been going on for about six weeks six weeks okay um and before that have you had any hearing problems at all um i had um i had something maybe about a year ago but it only lasted a couple of days it wasn't anything as long as this right okay okay and um in this six week period have you had anything else happen have you had any other ear symptoms at all um i occasionally get like a ringing in my left ear uh just on the one side and um there's actually been a few times when i felt kind of a bit sick or a bit dizzy as well right okay uh and just to clarify okay and just to clarify the difficulty you've got in hearing is that both ears or just the left ear or just the left ear all right so your right ear is fine it seems to be yeah okay so you've had ringing difficulty hearing in your left ear and feeling slightly sick and that's been on and off for the six weeks or is it continuous through that throughout that six weeks it's kind of on and off like some things trigger it as well so for example if i'm so for example if i'm watching tv or i listen to music or something that'll set off the ringing in the ear right okay and have you had any pain from the ear at all no okay have you been experiencing any fever not specifically apart from the dizziness and sickness i mentioned right okay and um has your ear been itchy at all okay now do you use cotton buds to try and clean clean out wax from your ears no i don't no okay well you're right you should we shouldn't be doing that it doesn't clean out the wax and push it back in all right um the first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear okay and just exclude the simple things the simple things might be wax you know someone might have impacted wax blocking the tube locking the tube going into the ear drum which can lead to muffled hearing if that's the case that's something that's easily fixable but so we need to exclude that first and then after that we can consider other potential possibilities and for that we need to have a look inside the ear drum so what i think we could do is maybe if we book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics it's not an emergency it can be done within the next four it's not an emergency it can be done within the next four or five days or so okay and then um what i'll do is i'll send a message to our admin team i'll ask them to slot you in in a clinic one of our clinics in that timeframe you can come in and one of the gp's just have a quick look down the ear figure out whether there's a physical blockage or whether there's something else going on okay can i just double check the dizziness that you've been getting um how severe is it uh nothing major it's just kind of uh it's like the kind of dizziness you get with nausea like uh not proper room spinning or anything like that but just and then after that we can we'll be a step closer to figuring out which way we're going to go it might be that there's a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear but we just need to exclude whether there's a physical blockage first and try and deal with that if that's the case okay so is that a sort of thing that can cause like this ringing i've got in my ear the ringing that you've got that you've got something called tinnitus right um and tinnitis is something actually that medicine doctors we don't really understand it fully we haven't you know people can't give you a specific cause for why some patients get tinnitis and some patients don't it can be triggered by a wide range of different things and in fact i'm glad that you mentioned that what i might do in the time between now and when you come for the appointment i'm going to put paste the link for a leaflet about tinnitis in the notes in the notes for this appointment i'd really appreciate it if you can start reading about it okay and often that that awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are and there are limited options that helps us in terms of the conversation about what we do next if you're it is clear okay so i'm going to paste a link to that and you can read about that and what we'll do is we'll see you in about four or five days it won't be me it'll be another gp but they'll have my notes and they'll know exactly what what my question is which is just a check your ears and they'll know exactly what what my question is which is just to check your ears is that okay yes that's great all right great so um bear with me five minutes and then you can come in the support team i'll give the number in the notes of this appointment bring them and then they'll stop you in okay okay brilliant all right if if there's any problem any issues between between now and when the clinical appointment is just book another appointment you can speak to one of us over video okay all right then take care nice to see you tomorrow bye bye
