there's no delays hello bye there hello there um thanks for thanks for being here um before i go any further can i confirm your name and your age please yes it's um adrian katarina and i'm 26 years old okay adrian how can i help you this afternoon well i have this like really crazy headache that's been going on for a few days and it really annoys me okay when did it exactly start this headache around three days ago maybe three days ago okay and whereabouts in your head is this pain it's basically like it kind of feels all over my right eye okay um and is a headache there all the time or does it come and go um it's it kind of comes and goes um but i mean he's there all the time but like sometimes it's stronger okay so it comes in point okay and if i was to ask you on a scale of one to ten um ten being the worst type of pain you ever pain you've had how would you rate this headache it's probably an eight and if i ask you to describe the headache to me in terms of the nature of the pain is it sharp is it dull is it crampy is it throbbing and it's kind of it's dull but sometimes it gets a bit sharper so basically it like it developed gradually i guess it's like i guess it's like the first day it just started when i was at work and by the end of the day it was like pretty pretty like it was a lot basically and then i was thinking okay maybe i'll just go to sleep and then i woke up the next morning like it was even even worse basically so you think the headache is getting worse over the last three days yeah okay have you tried anything which has made a headache better um so i tried ibuprofen so i took like a few for the last two days basically it doesn't really help no in the past it did help me which is why i decided to try it but okay anyways except the headaches any other symptoms at all sorry so your vision not really but just when it started i got these like weird shooting lights and like now like light is quite annoying my eyes wouldn't say annoying does it hurt look like a bright light yeah yeah it hurts okay and um have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision not loss of vision i wouldn't say it's just like some lights from shooting lights be okay any nausea or any vomiting um well i'm like basically i'm sick with the headache but i know vomiting when you say sick you mean you feel sick okay yeah no okay and any difficulty with speaking or um speech no any difficulty with with weakness in your arms and legs no it's hard to focus though so i i had to take a couple of days off work actually really okay okay no problem well i'll ask you a bit more about your work later on um any recent head injuries at all uh no okay and have you had anything like this before in the past yeah i mean headaches you mean or or similar to similar to this kind of headache yeah i mean i had but usually after i i take ibuprofen it kind of goes away so but this time it's just not okay and just moving forward are you otherwise fit and well adriana am i what sorry you fit and well any other medical history i think so it's just a headache any history of migraines at all cool not myself i've never had a migraine but my sister and my mom have them quite frequently okay um fine i'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second before i go any further can i ask do you take any regular medication um no are you on the pill no okay do you have any allergies to any medications not that i know of okay so you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines yeah are they is that normally well controlled or are they um having difficulty controlling the symptoms so my sisters like better like it kind of is very rare but my mom's is like quite bad um usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that yeah takes her out for a few days basically okay um socially tell me a bit more about your life outside of um outside of work who lives at home with you uh live with housemates so three of them so we're a four and are you working at the moment you mentioned this impacting your work yeah so i work well well i work in it so i work with computers a lot so it kind of is difficult to focus i had to like reduce the brightness of my screen okay do you wear glasses yes i do have any have you had any recent eye check done eye test no i've been wearing them since i was five years old always so if just for you to bear in mind if you feel like your eyes are straining i would always recommend having a repeat eye test done um have you been feeling more stressed or anxious at work recently well it's been a bit stressful kicking off a new project but um yeah nothing out of the ordinary really okay always great um regarding smoking or alcohol oh do you drink or smoke at all i socially smoke and i drink not only socially only socially okay right now um adriana do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms have you have you read anything online or spoken to people um not really um i at first i thought it's stress or maybe i didn't drink enough water because sometimes when i don't drink enough water i i i get headaches um but i don't think that's it and i'm like worried it's i don't want it to be a migraine because i know what it's like for my mom and my sister and it's really annoying so i i really don't want to have that and i know it's and i know it's genetic so i've researched that but i don't know if that is the case so is there anything in particular you were hoping i could do for you today yeah maybe just kind of if you have any recommendations of i can take something stronger because apparently ibuprofen doesn't help me um usually it gets resolved if i have a headache and like after like one or two days but currently it it didn't help me how many tablets did you take before your profaning uh three a day three a day okay all right um so adriana so um really what i think is going on here i unfortunately i do think this could be a headache very similar to migraine um the reason i say that is because the history is very suggestive of it given your mum and your sister also have migraines i think it's something for us to think about now i'm not saying it's going to keep happening but it may just be a one-off but it's certainly worth treating it today with some stronger analgesia or painkillers now moving forward we have some options which we can discuss you tried the ibuprofen now my only worry is i'm not sure whether you're taking the correct dose you can take up to two tablets three times a day there's definitely room for improvement there or i can prescribe you something stronger like naproxen which is another anti-inflammatory which can be helpful we can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or codeine which might be helpful as well yeah i think kudine is what my mom takes for when she has migraines okay so i think it's only worth looking into so i can give you a prescription for that today um with regards to um for the next few days it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's in it if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse um and you know and you like to come back and see me in about a week's time week to two weeks time if you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches we can think about giving you medications as prophylactic which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis but we can have that discussion next time okay okay in the meantime if your headaches aren't getting any better or they're headaches aren't getting any better or they're getting worse um you know i want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner okay okay if you have any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs or you're just not feeling very well just give me a call and come back and see me okay all right great great we'll have a good day thank you you too bye
