hi good morning hello there hi there this is dr jean mizer from gp at hand hello there i'm wondering if you can help me today okay sure i'll try um before we start could i please confirm your um full name and date of birth yes it's sarah smith and it's the second of november um nineteen ninety two that's great 92 that's great thank you sarah so are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment i am indeed yes okay so tell me what's been going on okay i've really not been feeling so well at all recently i've been struggling with fever for the past week yeah i would say it started about seven days ago i'm just really hot and sweaty all the time and just generally not feeling good okay all right sorry to hear that now along with this fever and this fever and sweating any other symptoms at all um i'd say that i'm aching all over really my muscles are really aching i'm feeling quite nauseous uh so i've not been able to eat very much and i have been drinking but it's been quite a small amount um yeah just generally quite tired and unwell i'm sweating during the the night i'm quite cold okay all right um and um so you you're having periods of when you're feeling hot and also periods of being cold as well yes yeah it's quite interchangeable not really a pattern to it okay and have you been taking any medication i've been trying to like take ibuprofen and paracetamol and in paracetamol just from over the counter but it's not really helping just been taking the recommended dose every day of those and when you say it's not helping is it bringing the temperature down at all perhaps slightly yes but i'm still experiencing these symptoms so it does take the edge off of it okay all right and can i just object have you got any cough or cold or sore throat any of those anything like that not those sort of symptoms really what other symptoms are you getting other than the ones you've already mentioned to me so i have i have a it's mainly just the sweating really and the nausea that's overtaking all day and the the aching muscles all over no no my ears are fine actually i haven't had any problems with my ears okay i just need to check for any other causes of infection in the body so i'm going to go through some kind of systemic question have you had any diarrhea and no not really no okay next next bin fine all right um do you have any headache not more than usual now just like the general headaches but not just from staring at the screen no migraines or anything okay so you know your normal headache where is that in the back of the head or the front of the head um it's quite centralized over over the head okay and how long have you been having that for it's something that i've struggled with for years really just related to a screen use or like changes in weather patterns yeah high pressure days sometimes i struggle with migraines and headaches have you got any rashes on your body anywhere i haven't noticed any rashes no any joints swollen or tender or so not really i mean i often have problems with back pain but not really any other joints okay all right any problems all right and have you got any kind of symptoms down below when you're passing urine no there's been no problems there okay any painful urination at all not at all now are you passing urine more often than normal i don't think so no it's been fairly regular have you been abroad anywhere recently yes uh i came back four weeks ago now and um uh did you take malaria preventative medication when you went out there i did yes which one did you take oh i can't remember now off the top of my head was it a weekly tablet or a daily tablet i think it was daily okay um and was it one tablet or and was it one tablet or was there another one that you would take on top of the first one i think it was uh another one that i took on top of the first one and what were you doing out in vietnam was it just you were saying the cities or going to villages or hiking what kind of activities we did it's quite nice really because we were there for a few weeks and we toured uh several different parts of the country and the the countryside countryside and some cities as well okay and um did you do any kind of were you in rivers or things like that were you you know how adventurous were you i'm sorry could you repeat that i missed that were you going out into the rivers were you going on beaches i mean how adventurous was your trip yes it was quite adventurous we were sort of trekking and cycling through farm land and seeing how people lived in their day-to-day life and in farm land right okay thank you for sharing that with me now do you have any other illnesses at all in the past as i said i've been struggling with back pain for quite a while but i haven't really had any major illnesses in the past i can think of and that pain have you seen anyone about that yes yeah i'm under a physiotherapist at the moment for that have they given you any kind of diagnosis at all um they've said that it's related to long periods of time sitting at a desk and just a bad posture so mainly the exercises are focused on improving posture and and strength of the muscles in the back are there any illnesses in your family at all the main one would be heart attack my father passed away of that um 68 i think yeah okay um are you on any medication at all uh just sarah zett okay uh do you have any allergies at all to medication no i've just really pollen allergy that's all i have okay so hay fever yes yeah just allergy all right um are you um you're working at the moment uh i am yes what do you work as i work as a nurse okay all right um and um you're up to date with all vaccinations hepatitis b that kind of thing yes indeed yeah okay but i'm i'm really struggling quite a lot of work at the moment sure i've been quite different feeling so uh tired all the time sure okay um and are you a smoker at all no i'm not okay and do you drink much alcohol moderate alcohol intake i don't drink too much and how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally i try and do some moderate physical exercise a few times a week okay that's good all right um so um what i think we're going what i think we're going to need to do is we're going to need to bring you into one of our clinics examine you and we're going to need to arrange some blood tests as well okay so what what i want to do is the first question that i have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this fever and these symptoms because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me there's no when someone has got fever and sweats we want fever and sweats we want to find out have they got chest infection have they got a throat infection and if we can't find a focus of infection then that's something that's an outstanding question that needs to be answered okay the second thing second factor is that you've recently come from vietnam and you've had exposure to rural areas and we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well so you're probably going to need some blood tests after you've been seen by somebody now the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you which is why we're going to go for the examination first okay come into one of our clinics in central london that's one option and then the gp there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be or if it's inconvenient for you to come into central london because you you're you're living further out come into central london because you you live you're living further out you could actually just attend a local a&e i'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of tests i think you need in the notes for this appointment so you could show that to them at reception i'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films to check for malaria and inflammatory markers and things like that technical terms but they'll understand what that what i'm talking about but um i don't think you can go into work uh until we've sorted this out and we you know we need to work uh until we've sorted this out and we you know we need to sort that sooner rather than later okay okay that sounds great thank you so much for your help i i think yeah i can come straight into central london today to get that sorted okay fine so what i'm going to do is i will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in and if you can ring the number that i leave in your consultation notes after a few minutes and then they'll sort you in and then we can sort things out from there okay that's brilliant thank you very much all right then okay take care and all the best goodbye bye
