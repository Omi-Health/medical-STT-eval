hi hi hi how are you yeah i'm all right thanks um so um she's feeling a little bit wheezy okay my name is dr ben i'm one of the surgeons that works in babylon can i confirm your name and date of birth please yeah my my name is um uh tina smith and i'm 40 years old okay and are you in a space that's quiet and private uh yeah yeah okay i'm just and you mentioned that you're wheezy can you tell me a little bit more about that yeah so um it started like about two days ago um i don't know if i don't know if it's because you know i was like cleaning the house and like um all this dust came out of the the carpet and you know i've always the thought that maybe you've got an allergy to like dust um or something so i don't know if it was triggered by um you know two days later still not got any better so um just getting a little bit worried about it now okay so you were cleaning the house two days ago and that's when it first started yeah that's right did the wheezing start suddenly or was it gradual so it started after maybe an hour or so and has it got worse over the past two days yeah so it gets a bit worse um at night i find okay and have you taken anything for the wheeze uh no no i haven't actually okay so and the wheeze has been getting worse and today you're particularly worried is it because you're finding it hard to breathe or finding it hard to talk yeah yeah both of both actually so um i'm feeling like a little bit uh short of breath okay um and actually when i'm talking to my friends and stuff finding that sometimes i'm unable to complete my sentences and it can get really bad yeah and when you can breathe and you take a deep breath do you notice any pain um no no no pain and have you noticed yourself feeling dizzy or the room spinning more than normal uh no no dizziness uh none of that and have you been eating and drinking okay particularly water yeah yeah i think i'm having like you know four or five glasses a day yeah okay and are you normally fit and well or do you have any other medical problems um well actually i used to have like a bit of asthma as a child and also in the summer i sometimes get hay fever and when you get hay fever do you take medications for it not really okay and your asthma didn't resolve when you were a child i think mostly yeah i mean sometimes when i um run for like long periods it can it can start up a bit but um i have a have like an asthma halo use for that okay so do you still have your inhalers um i think i might have one from like a couple of months ago okay but you don't see your doctor regularly for asthma no i don't okay and apart from this do you know if you're allergic to anything not that i know of okay and how far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment sorry could you repeat that how far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment uh they may be minutes drive away okay good so given that you've had a history of asthma when you were a child and you get hay fever sometimes in the summer your shortness of breath hi i've lost um video signal can you still hear me um yeah we've just turned off haven't so given you've got a history of asthma and hay fever this could be one of two things but we want to rule out asthma or an allergy first so what you'd need is visit one of our clinics so we can do some more tests so the first thing the first thing we would do is use a small device on your finger to check the amount of oxygen in your blood okay and from that we can tell if it's asthma or something else all right okay before this happens if you've got something like an antihistamine which you normally take for hay fever at home i would take one just in case it is an allergy you've had from the dust okay yeah i don't have any antihistamines at home unfortunately you might oh yeah i don't have any antihistamines at home unfortunately you might be able to get one on your way to the doctor's surgery if not they can prescribe you one okay okay so i can just get it over the counter then yes and they're normally about four to six pounds okay is there anything else that you're particularly worried about or want to ask me um not really i mean i have before taken steroids for asthma um i don't know taken steroids for asthma i don't know if that's relevant yes that is and you may need to take some steroids now but we cannot we won't be able to know until we've done those tests first okay okay cool so i'm going to write a letter for your gp just to let him know what's happened and the consultation with the gp in person shouldn't take too long all right how long do you you think it will take probably 10 minutes okay that's great cool you should get the letter over the app and then we can you can take yourself to the gp all right cool thank you very much okay bye okay thank you bye-bye
