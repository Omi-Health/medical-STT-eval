hello hi there i'm dr dean mezza from babylon good morning good morning sorry before we start could i get your full name and date of birth is that possible yeah sure um my name is juan doe um and i'm 27 years old um so i was born in 1991 um 17th of november that's perfect thank you for that are you um john are you in thank you for that are you um john are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment yeah perfect thank you for that okay so tell me what the problem is you've been having some difficulty breathing is that correct yeah exactly i'm kind of struggling to breathe at the moment i i got stung by a wasp um recently or i'm not sure whether it's kind of bitten or stung um but i uh i'm feeling like slightly anxious anxious that there's a bit of i've got a bit of a rash on my arm where i got stung and and i kind of yeah as i say i've got this difficulty breathing and potentially um there's a bit of swelling in my lips and tongue feels a bit weird right okay so when did this bee sting or bee bite occur um it was just a few minutes ago right right okay um and your your lips don't seem swollen to me right now but do they which can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen yeah it's just kind of on the right hand side um and and it's just a bit sore maybe it hasn't kind of really swollen up yeah okay uh you said you've been having some difficulty breathing yeah your breathing seems all right to me right now um the reason why i'm terrifying you because we have to the reason why i'm terrifying you because we have to decide whether this is an acute emergency whether i need to send you into hospital straight away or whether it's more time to ask questions okay so um do you feel like you've got difficulty breathing right now this minute as we speak i i i don't feel like it's like particularly acute but i'm just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a bit worse sure i don't i just wanted to speak to someone sure you do the right thing and i can understand understand it is quite anxiety provoking okay all right can i just double check before we carry on ask any other questions have you got a history of anaphylaxis uh not that i know of no okay have you ever been given an epipen uh i haven't no okay all right let's um take a step back now so in terms of the b's did you see the b or you were just assuming it was it a bee um i i i find it difficult to tell the difference between a bee and a wasp but um one of the two yeah it was one of the two okay okay and um the area of body that stung where was it did you say it was your arm yeah it was on my arm all right and you've got a rash there can i have a look uh yeah sure um it's just just there okay all okay all right that looks okay to me right now did it look red to you at the moment it's it's slightly red yeah and kind of there's a bit of a like a hole where where i think that the yeah yeah the puncture mark yeah okay all right um now is is there any swelling around that area that you can see i couldn't see any um not particularly i i guess it's just a bit kind of blotchy and a bit of a rash it doesn't feel like particularly swollen sure okay all right um now have you taken any medication it's probably you probably haven't because it was a few minutes ago but have you is it not taking any antihistamines or anything like that no not at the moment no nothing nothing yeah okay uh now um if i can just go back do you have any history of any any kind of illnesses at all um i i've had exma before um okay yeah that's kind of the the major thing nothing nothing okay have you got the history of any allergies to anything uh i'm allergic to penicillin all right good um and in your family is there any history of any kind of acute not that i think is particularly relevant no i don't have i don't have any right and um do you have allergies to any kind of cats or dogs or pets or anything like that uh not that i know of i've yeah i've been around dogs and cats yeah and you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware no okay um can i ask do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks or anything like that uh yeah uh sometimes occasionally right okay have you ever been on medication for that um no oh no um great now um i need to ask a few questions maybe not directly related to this but just for for general information purposes so are you working at the moment yes what do you work as i am a computer scientist okay and are you living alone yes okay do you have any pets at home i have a cat yes okay great what i'd like to do now if that's okay john is i'd like to have a look inside your mouth now if that's okay john is i'd like to have a look inside your mouth okay one of the things that um we'd be worried about if someone's got having an allergic reactions to see whether there's any swelling of the lips or the tissues inside the mouth or the soft tissues of the airway and um i can i've got a fairly good view of your lips but i'd like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put your head back mouth open wide sit somewhere where there's good lighting and i just want to have a look inside the throat if that's okay perfect okay great now um can can i just do it again just say ah this time ah okay fantastic brilliant okay um based on how you look how you're talking to me and how you're breathing and the appearance on your wrist i don't feel that you're having a life-threatening allergic reaction now it's very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite it's a localized inflammatory reaction that is normal and that immediate reaction that redness and that's maybe slight swelling is usually temporary what we're worried about is when someone has um compromise of their breathing so you mentioned breathing difficulties and images swelling of your lip thankfully i can't see any of that right now but that's the most urgent and most pressing thing that we'd be watching out for given that it hasn't happened initially it's unlikely to happen later okay so we have like a stage one and stage two reaction for these types of bites have like a stage one and stage two reaction for these types of bites and usually if you're going to have their reaction it will happen straight away so we may be coming out of the danger zone now but i'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens so for example you would have swelling of the lips difficulty breathing you might have something called stridor which is an inspiratory sound that when you're trying to breathe it makes like a rasping sound like this okay thankfully you don't have anything like that right now it seems to me this is a localized allergic reaction however if anything changes if anything deteriorates either make an appointment with us or go straight to ane and in some cases if it's if it's progressing rapidly it's better to go straight to ane rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us okay what i'd like you to do now is i'd like you to try and take try and take some antihistamines so you can buy them with a counter you can get piriton or clobenamine and you can take one tablet four milligrams up to about six times a day okay or you can just take a one a day one whichever is your preference that's that's absolutely fine there's no no issue that should be enough to control this um if the redness in your arm spreads and it feels hot or you know you have signs of any localized infection we may need to think about we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic and like i said if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing that's over and we need to process that someone action needs to be taken urgently did you have any other um queries or was there anything else that you were worried about uh no i think i think that kind of that makes me feel a bit better i guess can i get that um can i get the uh so the antihistamine from any shop or like does it have to be over the counter you don't need to any chemist will have it you don't need to put it in the machine yeah it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually than to get it by prescription okay now um on the basis of what you've told me i don't think you need any allergy testing i think this is just a straightforward localized reaction to an insect bite however if it was to happen that you know this you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other non-specific reactions you know this you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other nonspecific reactions you might need to think about the testing i don't think we're at that moment yeah okay so but that's something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurrent pattern okay okay then so we'll leave it like that for now okay i'm going to leave a link to some information about anaphylactic reactions just for you to read about it i don't want to panic but just for you to be aware of some of the symptoms are if those kind of things happen get back to us if kind of things happen get back to us if you're feeling worried just have a low threshold for having a chat with us sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down okay great yeah that makes sense all right then john okay well we'll leave it there come back to us if you have any further issues okay thanks i appreciate your time my pleasure all right take care that all the best bye bye
