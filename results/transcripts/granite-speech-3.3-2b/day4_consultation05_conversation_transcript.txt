and are you able to talk at the moment yeah yeah okay tell me it says here you have a you're uh you're having problems going to the toilet yeah yes so i have i have a i don't know how do you say it properly in english i mean with i don't know i don't know what would cause it i have a bit of pain cominal pain and i had a bit of vomiting and yeah so these are kind of like what is happening to me okay tell me how you were three days ago before this started did you have any medical problems so i have i have i have asthma and i take some uh some um inhaler okay i don't know i take an inhaler and um i have an allergy i have an nkda allergy okay so i don't know if it's because i don't know okay and apart from asthma do you have anything else uh else i don't know maybe it's because you know it's sitting here in the stomach stuff i always have in the back of my head my father because he died about 10 years ago of cancer okay so yeah this is kind of the diarrhea for three days and now you're having pain and vomiting yes yes has the diarrhea been getting better or worse it's kind of like normal it hasn't gone away it hasn't worsened okay and how often do you go to the toilet i go i need to go i i can't go to work because i need to go like every i don't know is this feeling like i go to the toilet and then when i finish i need to i feel i need to go again okay and and uh and yeah so i need to be like close to the toilet that must be that must be hard yeah yeah have you had to drink more water than lulu i don't know maybe i'm not drinking enough water yeah i drink i think i yeah i don't know i think i don't drink enough water an important question have you noticed any blood no i haven't noticed any blood and you mentioned tummy pain can you tell me more about your tummy pain like where it is and if it goes anywhere so the pain is mainly uh focus in in the center area of the abdomen like under the belly under the belly bottom yeah and yeah and sometimes i can hear my stomach like the cums yeah we've been able to eat and drink uh yes yes but yes but i i go to the toilet so often so i i i yeah i try not to eat a lot because i yeah i just go into the toilet every 10 minutes and you said the tummy pains in the middle of your tummy does it go anywhere else no no just there and it it seems to be alleviated be toilet and maybe it's like trapped gas i don't know what it is but okay and when was the last time you vomited i think it was this morning this morning i but the thing is like because i'm not eating anything now so i haven't vomited again did you have any breakfast i don't know i didn't no sorry yes i did actually i did hold on i had some pro okay and that and you vomited that up afterwards and afterwards i didn't have anything then i got a bit of nausea and i vomited and then and i was sick and i was sick and i have many vomiting so now i think i'm okay but yeah i yeah did you notice any blood when you vomited i think i do i think i do but it's no no actually i can't say sorry i'm sorry i i don't think there is blood because yeah it was it was strawberries that i was having for breakfast so so yeah it was strawberries okay and um a few years ago did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain uh i i don't know no to be honest sometimes i have when i get a bit of anxiety i i use my inhaler yeah but my inhaler kind of ran out the one because you know i'm a foreigner so i have this brand but i bought a new one here okay and i don't know maybe this new one has caused it okay yes problem i don't know okay it's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy i have a pain like this normally it's when you eat bad food or food that has gone off and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested but just to double check have you noticed any problems with your breathing i always have problems with my breathing because of the asthma like when i take shots i need to use my inhaler a little bit but apart from the normal i haven't i haven't okay and how about chest have you noticed any chest pain no i haven't i haven't noticed any chest pain okay and how about um walking and talking are those all both okay uh walking and talking uh yes yes uh i but uh but yeah i don't walk very far because uh but yeah i don't walk very far because i yeah i need to i need to go to the toilet now and then so i'm spending some time at home and when you press on your tummy does it cause any pain oh it does a little bit sorry i was just writing some things down so what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain and it's normal this is normally called gastritis so an infection over the tummy normally when patients have this we do three things number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because you're losing lots at the moment number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers so if you start getting a temperature then you need to go to the hospital and number three is stay home for the time being until you get slightly better okay and normally things like antibiotics don't help they make the situation worse okay so that's idea yeah go ahead sorry no i was saying i didn't have any fever recently i was sweating a little bit in class for bed but i i'm not sure if if i had a bit of fever but very little or i i don't think so i don't think i don't know maybe so i think that's what we should do for the time being if you feel you're getting much worse then i then i would suggest you go see your gp in real life in person so they can look at your belly okay i will yeah i will book then i will book i will wait a couple of days to see or one more day and then i will book yeah yeah cool do you have any more questions for me uh no that's that's it i was maybe just concerned about my father's medical history if father's medical history if that would yeah could there at some kind of risk so the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had but if your things don't get worse then that's something that we can look at from the gp okay does that sound okay yeah that sounds good that sounds good thank you ellen thank you very much doctor for your time bye bye
