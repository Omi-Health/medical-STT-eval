hi hi can you hear me yeah i can hear you good my name is dr gohil i'm one of the physicians that works here at babylon can i confirm your name and date of birth please my name is sarah smith and my date of birth is the 20th of the 4th 1983 and are you in a space that's private and quiet and you can talk yeah good so it says um i've got a note to say it says you're feeling short of breath is that correct yeah okay are you able to tell me a little bit more about that yeah i was watching tv and um just like over the last hour i've started to feel like a bit short of breath this is while you're sitting watching tv yeah okay and have you noticed anything like this before no okay and apart from the shortness of breath have you noticed anything else so i started with a cough yesterday um yeah i i don't know if it's um relevant but i had a c section a few weeks ago okay and how long ago was that just a few weeks yeah four weeks okay and are you with baby at the moment yes sir and how is baby doing yeah he's good any coughs or colds with uh them no no he's fine okay so you've noticed shortness of breath for just an hour while sitting and watching tv and you had your c section a couple of weeks ago yes and yesterday you noticed a cough yeah so talk to me about the cough have you brought anything up no i haven't no and when was the last time you were ill with a flu or symptoms like this um you know i get colds coughs and colds quite a lot but probably good few months ago okay and this shortness of breath you're having is it getting worse um no i mean i don't know i feel like i'm getting really stressed out because like my heart is really going okay so you're feeling your heart more than normal yeah and the shortness of breath does it cause any pain in your chest um no how about when you take a very deep breath in um i mean yeah my chest feels sore but so does my c section scar you know it's it's all tender and since your c section did you have to take any medications um no just some pink in it and can you remember what the name of those were they gave me some coding and have you had to use that regularly yeah i've been taking that fairly fairly regularly but probably haven't taken it for a week okay and apart from the c section and the shortness of breath have you got any other medical problems i should know about um no and you are allergic to ibuprofen though okay and what happens when you take ibuprofen um i don't know so i need you to do something for me have you measured the rate of your heart before uh yes have you measured it recently it recently either with an iwatch or something similar no i haven't no okay we might need to do that over the phone so are you able to put your right hand on your left wrist just underneath your thumb and see if you can feel your heartbeat yeah so what i need you to do is when i count to three count down from three just count the number of beats you've noticed and i'll tell you when to stop is that okay yeah so we'll start in three two one go great that should be enough how many did you count i counted 30 good so your heart is running slightly breathing slightly fast at the moment which is probably because of your shortness of breath and some of the pain that you're under okay given that you've had a c section and you're short of breath which has come on quite recently and quite quickly it might be worth you going into the hospital to get checked out a bit further okay so there's two ways of us doing this the first is i can call an ambulance or you can take yourself to the hospital with baby which one would you prefer it feels a bit dramatic to call an ambulance i'll go i'll take myself sure and what i would suggest is go fairly quickly and take some bits for baby at the same time okay and if you're taking any medications like codeine don't don't take them for the time being okay is anyone else with you at home no my partner's at work okay so i think that's the best thing to do for the time being so what i'm worried about at the moment is given that you've had a c section some people can suffer with clots and those can either be found in the legs or your chest so in your lungs yeah it's quite a common thing to happen and it's not something to worry about but needs to be checked out in the hospital first okay and if it if that does become the case they can give you something to reduce the clot all right okay really quick really quick okay yeah i mean my mom's had clots in her legs before so i guess you know yeah that makes sense i know what they are good are you are you particularly worried about anything or do you want to ask me anything before we go no no i'm fine i'll i'll just take myself to the hospital great thank you so much all right thank you bye
