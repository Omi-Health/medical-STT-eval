hi there it's dr smith from babylon can you confirm your name date of birth and your home address please um i can't hear you at the moment actually could you turn up the volume up yeah that's better thank you okay sorry everyone are you in a private place you can have a consultation um yes what can i do for you today um i've been having this blinding headache for a few days um and it's like really bothering me and i find it very hard to focus or like i can't even go to work okay and any headaches in the past before this not really just on and off um i recently had a one for like two days um but it just went away with abruptly and so nothing like or longer than two days so how did this start um it just started all of a sudden i woke up one morning with a headache and that was three days ago and i just keep having it doesn't really go away with abruptly and really go away with acupuncture either i try that but it just it gets a little bit better but like doesn't go away okay and whereabouts in your head is the pain um it's kind of all over but i feel like over my right eye is a bit stronger okay any problems with your vision or any problems tolerating the light um light's definitely making me more sensitive like i don't really like strong lights and yeah vision i think i get is shooting lights sometimes i'm not sure how to explain it just a bit of a weird kind of vision okay and any any nausea or vomiting no feeling a bit sick but no watery tingling or numbness or weakness anywhere no any change in your smell or taste no no at all and in the past when you've had headaches what have they been like um i would say quite normal headaches it takes just a bit of a pressure in between my eyes but nothing major okay and with with this has it been there all the time or is it coming and going kind of all the time so when i take ibuprofen it gets a bit better so it's a bit like less it bothers me less but then i still have it if you know and what would you say the severity is if if 10 is the worst pain you've ever had and zero is nothing what would you say the pain is like i guess it's mostly eight and then it comes down to maybe a five okay and what about at nighttime are you able to fall asleep um yeah i'm sleeping well is it waking you up in the nighttime no no no i can wake up with it in the morning okay any worse when you change position or bend over or cough or anything like that sometimes when i stand up quickly i get a bit of a stabbing pain or if i turn my head like i kind of feel like something is moving inside okay and have you had any uh eye checks recently um yeah i've actually had one recently and nothing changed my vision okay and have you had any cold symptoms sore throat sore ears or pain over the sinuses any any nose bleeds or coughing up any blood or anything you know and just recently have you been well or have you had any change in your weight or tiredness lack of energy anything like that no change of weight maybe lack of energy but maybe because i'm just having the headache so i find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities like you know when you have a constant headache you know at work recently um i work from home but couldn't really manage to do it all the time so sometimes i just do sometimes i just do the deal so you've been you've had a headache for three days how many days have you missed off work um so i worked from home all these three days and first day i worked from home and then um the second day i just took the whole day off and today i just tried to work from home the first half of the day but i i just stopped in the morning because i couldn't focus okay and any other medical problems in the past um i think i only had a little pain um when i was younger but no cause was found and that went away but that's the only thing i know okay have you been abroad recently at all no do you take any medications um just the bill which one um right now nothing really changes okay and when you had when you've had when you described your headaches in the past you said they were just general did you have any visual symptoms no no was your blood pressure checked recently with your pill um yeah i had a check in the pharmacy when i got the pill and they said it was normal when was that a year ago okay um and any allergies to anything and who'd you live with at home sorry who'd you live with at home just by myself okay and do you smoke no do you drink any alcohol regularly yeah how much in a normal week do you think um probably like three beers once a week okay and do you take any other drugs at all no apart from the epirrofen i take sometimes when the headache gets really bad nothing else so i mean it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache and you said you had some altered light in front of your eyes as well yeah but you haven't had a high temperature have you checked your temperature uh no i didn't i don't really feel so rush or anything okay um i mean it it it could possibly be a migraine type headache but the fact it's still ongoing for three days we probably should put you into an appointment to get an examination um obviously if it settles in the meantime then we can cancel that but we should do a neurological examination look at the back of your eyes as well okay um in terms of medication i can prescribe you something similar to ibuprofen but a bit stronger which you can take instead of ibuprofen and you can take paracetamol at the same time okay so if you're happy to book an appointment with the support line for us to do a full examination and start the medication which i prescribed you take it with food if if you're you said that when you go to bed your headaches okay and not waking you up in the nighttime but you mentioned migraine and that um reminded me that my mom suffers from actually has migraine okay any other family history of medical problems um no i didn't answer but i know that my mom like she has quite bad migraines she's like has the vomiting and everything okay that's fine um i mean if if in the meantime before your appointment your headache is getting unbearable getting worse or changing then you can call us for further advice on that okay and when when you have an examination with us we'll check your blood pressure as well just to make sure your pill is still appropriate for you because sometimes if we if we do think it's a migraine then you would have to change your pill if you've had these flashing lights and things like that is there anything in the pill that can cause it or is it well some say that pill if you were having regular migraines with flashing lights or other symptoms it wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill particularly we'd have to change it something else all right but you can carry on with that for the moment okay have you got any other questions um so would you like um send me a referral to a specialist or uh or to yeah if you make an appointment with the support team then we can do a full examination then all right then take care thank you very much bye
