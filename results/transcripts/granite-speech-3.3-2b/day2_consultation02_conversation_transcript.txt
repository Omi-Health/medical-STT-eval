something um have like a weird swelling on on on my elbow i noticed that when i was in the shower uh it's not painful at all uh like i i feel fine but it's just a bit weird to see that it's slightly warm and i kind of feel like this it's a bit fluid inside or so so i want to know what's going on with you and so did you say it was the left elbow the right elbow left upper okay and have you banged that elbow did you have any kind of injury no not really um not that i know of i haven't noticed anything i can actually like move it normally um it just i can just see that it feels strange sure okay and um in terms of your job do you do anything physical not really no i just you know sit at the desk and write okay and has this happened before no no i haven't noticed that before i don't have any like history of of seeing this i don't remember uh so okay and can i um can i stop a chat has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases is like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that um oh well i i do well i think i think i have something like also a crisis um uh it sometimes kind of hurts my joints but uh in my family i'm not sure okay no no sure so you know you said you think you've got osteoarthritis has anyone ever told you that have you ever seen a senior doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis um yes yes a few years ago okay was that a gp or a specialist or is it a physiotherapist a gp um gp okay all right um rick can i just sorry can i just double check how old you are please i'm uh 53 53 okay fantastic all right um and do you have any other the illnesses at all um well not naturally you know um so i'm i'm allergic to to peanuts and what okay that's pretty all i have to say about my medical history yeah are you allergic to any medication no not that i know sure and do you are you on any medication on a regular basis and no okay and you normally fit and well mobile activity i do i do uh do some sports i run regularly like two three times a week um yeah no i'm i think i'm healthy okay good glad to hear that well done that's good that you're doing that on a regular basis okay um and um uh can i is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now yes sure okay keep it with me one second right okay and if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that a bit higher so i can just see the underside okay fantastic all right and then just bring it around to this side essentially i can see the other side okay fantastic all right and if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers is it hot compared to the surrounding skin the adjacent skin it's a bit warmer okay and is it very tender when you're pressing on that now does it if you give it a press does it hurt you at all on the on the tip of the elbow it's okay just like next to it like where the the swelling is it's a bit yeah it feels yeah it feels a bit fluid okay all right um well um i noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body no no pre- do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you suffer from eczema or allergic to do you regards to your elbow problem okay is um i think it would be worthwhile this seems like uh what we call the bursitis okay so that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint um what i think we should do is i think we should be on some anti-inflammatory medication in the in the first instance and as well as that what i would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of causes of joint swelling okay so what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some blood tests to be sent out to your house and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done and that will involve you having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers infection rheumatological antibodies and so we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well okay okay the timeframe for that will be um the results will come back to us after about five six days um it takes time for the forms to come out to you and if you get the test done straight away by the time that we're expecting a result back you know one or two days after that we're looking at maybe six days and what i'd suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint feel it we can review the blood tests and we can get a gauge as to what's going on now in terms of your joint right now it doesn't look like to me like something called excuse me septic arthritis so we're worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint and your joint doesn't look like that however if your the elbow was to become very red very painful and the redness was to spread or become you know more intense then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment more immediate treatment okay do you think it's something dangerous like something like can i get a date from that or is it i don't think this is anything dangerous i don't think this is anything dangerous don't you worry okay what i'm doing is i'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop okay so if we go to worst case this is not the case right now right now it looks quite straightforward nothing sinister or life-threatening what i'm doing is i'm just saying in case things were to develop this is nothing's sinister or life-threatening what i'm doing is i'm just saying in case things worse than these are the things that we'd be looking out for and this is what you have to do but you don't have that now thankfully and i don't think you're going to have it but i'm just saying the what-if scenario is that okay yeah that sounds good thank you all right did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me well just yeah i just wanted to know about this um yeah it feels a bit better now to know that all right uh at the end of that's it thank you okay so i would take ibuprofen regularly okay you can get that over the counter um that's 400 milligrams two times a day and you should take that after food not on an empty stomach if you get any heartburn stop taking it okay sure all right so what i want to do is i'll get the forms out to you and um we are going to arrange a a follow-up appointment maybe with an um we are going to arrange uh a follow up appointment maybe within a um actually you know the follow up appointment doesn't have to be face to face if it's more convenient if you do it to do it over the phone we can do that over the phone over video we can do that as well that's that's your call but you contact us after you've had the blood test done and we can review things down okay okay yeah that sounds good i i'll do that and if i see that it's getting worse i'll probably ask for a physical appointment but sure sure that's a good idea all right then okay um take care then so i'll just leave that with you all right then okay um take care then so i'll just leave that with me i'll sort all those bits and pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll we'll review after the test things go well all right all right take care all the best bye
