alex oh hello how can you hear me okay great um how can i help you this morning sir i so i've been feeling i've been feeling kind of uh under the weather for the past four days um it started with a um uh sore throat and runny nose and it's sort of going into a cough now the sore throat is kind of going away but i'm starting to cough okay so it's here that kind of bad and tired okay i'm sure it's here that there's a lot going on there so let's start with your your sore throat first tell me a bit more about that if you can um so i i you know i think i it all started with a colleague of mine she she just kept sneezing next to me all the time i think her kids are catching something from the uh from the kindergarten or something and uh yeah that it it started as normal sore throat and okay it was quite painful for a couple of days but then i was fast okay okay i did have any difficulty or pain on swallowing um yeah yeah it was uh it was quite painful to swallow okay for one of the days did you did you notice a look in the back of your throat in the mirror um no not really no okay you didn't notice any abnormal white spots redness at the back of your throat um no i i didn't think about uh looking that's okay that's okay and you mentioned a runny nose um again what kind of discharge is coming out is it clear or is it a bit more colored yeah yeah it's yeah it's clear but sort of um sort of getting my nose stuffed all the time it's very hard to uh to get it free okay you feel quite congested you yeah quite congested okay fine um you also mentioned okay and is it worse at any particular time of the day sorry is it is it worse at any particular time of the day for example in the evenings nighttime mornings or just throughout the day no it's it's um it's sort of it's sort of constant okay um i forgot to mention that um i'm also having uh night sweats and night sweats that's right it's okay that's very odd actually and that sort of makes me retired and makes me a bit uneasy i can imagine yes and this has again been going on for the last three four days has it yes okay um right okay have you noticed any fevers or temperatures at all um i had some some fever in the beginning but it's now sort of going down i've been taking some paracetamol and ibuprofen for that and they they help that's very sensible very good in terms of your chest otherwise have you any difficulty breathing or any pain in your chest so no pain in the chest but i noticed that i um so i feel a bit winded on exertion so if i i haven't been going going to the gym that's um because of that when you say when did you feel do you feel more a shorter breath would you say on exertion is that what you're saying okay um and and that's mainly on exercise but when you're resting there's no problems yeah yeah when when i'm resting it's okay so i've been actually going to work and sort of managing okay fine just a couple of other questions sir please if you don't mind any pain in your ears at all um no you don't feel blocked to any discharge coming out of your ears i don't think so okay fine um what i'm gonna do i'm going to run through a few yes no questions if you don't mind just a review of your systems any headaches at all yeah yeah that's still that's still there whereabouts are the headaches um just sort of general um and they're not they're not always there but you know every now and they would come and go okay and with these headaches have you had any problems with your with your eyesight your vision um no any difficulty with seeing bright lights no i don't think so okay um and just moving down now in terms of any any feeling of nausea or any vomiting no none of that okay tell me about your bowels are you bells making okay um yeah yeah think so i'm passing urine okay yeah yeah how's your appetite sir yeah i've been i've been drinking a little bit more than the usual but uh so other than that okay um and you're eating and drinking are you eating okay otherwise um maybe a bit less than uh than what one i would usually have okay um have you any funny rashes at all on your skin um no no and any general muscle pain or aches joint pains or much yeah yeah that's that sort of started in the past couple days yeah okay all right um and uh just have a look at the rest of your history are you otherwise fit and well or do you have any other medical problems i should be aware of um so otherwise that uh i'm fine there's um there isn't anything that i'm taking or i'm being treated for okay um but you are otherwise fit and well uh any any allergies at all to any medications i should be aware of um no no allergies okay um any family history at all so anything relevant in the family that i should be aware of thinking like diabetes high blood pressure um yeah my grandma has diabetes um your brother and my grandma do you say grandma sorry my apologies grandma okay um do you know what type of diabetes it is is it type one or two i think it's type two okay um anything else which you think is significant yeah i i think um one of my uh great grandads had an xema excellent okay okay um just moving on to what we say so social history just to get to know you a bit more as a person tell me who do you live with at home oh um i live alone okay and you said you're working at the moment is that right yeah yeah what do you do for work um um i'm an accountant okay and how's your work going at the moment over the last has it has it been affecting your work um a little bit i've been a bit slower and you know it's a it's a bit of a stressful period just around the end of the year okay is that stress is affecting your um your mood at all in any way no i think i think it's it's the you know it's the good kind of stress yeah okay it's good work if there's anything you ever want to talk to me but you can always come see me about your mood and stress anxiety we're happy to help no i i i like my job it's just you know it's a bit more work okay and just very briefly in terms of smoking at all um yeah occasionally no cigars and things on company parties okay so not regular um and what about alcohol um occasionally i would have some i'm not a very big drinker again socially would work um okay um so um so just having listened to your story um um really just to summarize you know it's the last four days you've been feeling quite unwell sore throat running nose bit of a dry cough bit of muscle pain weakness um had an initial fever but now settled um i don't think there's a lot to worry about i think you probably have you know a bit of a viral what we say viral illness or maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection or maybe early signs of a flu um it's normally it normally lasts for about seven to ten days and just gets better really over time but things you can do to really help yourself is get plenty of rest i'll probably advise you taking a day or two off work if you can making yourself you know pushing fluids and make yourself well hydrated continuing with the regular paracetamol and ibuprofen and we should see how things go really um if next week is still not better i'd like you to come back and see me um is that clear is that does that make does that make yeah yeah that's that's that's all good it makes sense i think i think they'll take a couple days off yeah and yeah yeah that's that's that's all good it makes sense uh i think i think they'll take much sooner give me a call um and we can help you guys okay yeah yeah i'll take care great have a great day good luck with your work thank you thank you
