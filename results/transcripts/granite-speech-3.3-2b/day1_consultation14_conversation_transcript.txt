like maybe a bit less than a week ago like maybe maybe five or six days ago okay and you mentioned a couple of things there you mentioned a cough you mentioned a bit of a runny nose that right okay let's focus on your cough first can you tell me a bit more about your cough it's just so continuous it's really really frustrating it's quite dry and it's just all day like and it's just all day like keeps me up at night as well which is really annoying okay so it's a dry cough you're not bringing up any more you're not bringing up any more oh i can hear that yeah um you're not bringing up any uh mucous phlegm or anything like that no okay so keep you up at night um you mentioned uh the cold symptoms well the running nose jabber jabber saw throat is all i mean apart from i mean the coughing is giving me a sore apart from i mean the coughing is giving me a sore throat but it's not like you know not more than than that you know just just my throat is irritated from coughing but it's not like it's not that bad when i swallow or anything right jeremy and do you are you hearing your ears your ears feel blocked no they feel okay actually yeah no pain or discharge from your ears not pain on the ears okay all right um fine in terms of your breathing um how is your breath how's your chest is your breathing more labored um i don't think so like i guess like it's laborious when i'm coughing and i can't breathe but i not yeah and i i don't think so when you walk around you don't feel breathless you no i feel you know generally tired okay yeah but not not anything special with my chest any pain in your chest no not not that either okay you mentioned feeling tired um have you felt feverish at all have a temperature i've been having like like shivers even when i'm in when i'm in bed you know like when you when you go to sleep and and you feel like i i and and you feel like i i should be warm but i'm still still you know shivering a little bit but i haven't checked my temperature so i'm not 100 sure if i had a fever but it feels like i probably did because i was just i was next to my boyfriend and he was completely warm and totally fine and i just i couldn't stop shivering and kept adding more sweaters on and i was still cold i do okay okay all right um fine and in terms of off any other symptoms so have you had any nausea have you had any vomiting no no no nausea no vomiting like um yeah nothing like that how's your appetite um i mean it's okay i at the beginning like when i was starting to have the symptoms the coughing and stuff um i had a little bit of diarrhea um but but i didn't it didn't cut my appetite or anything i just like my stomach wasn't feeling great okay it got better now the diarrhea yeah yeah it got better it was only like the first like it started at the same time as the cough started and then it stopped i thought everything would be fine but then the cough just kept going okay fine um any problems with your water works at all with with my work uh your your water works your urine oh uh no no no that's fine you're passing urine okay you're drinking plenty of fluids and passing urine okay yeah i i drank lots of water when i started having the diarrhea now that's stopped i just went back to normal okay all right um in terms of any other things you've noticed any any funny skin rashes or um problems with your muscles or joints uh i like my you know when muscles or joints uh i like my you know when i have when i was telling you i had like the i had chills and i was really cool my mouth was really hurting like it's hurting me so much at the moment right um so to be honest all i feel like doing is just lying in bed right okay okay i'm sorry that must be very difficult for you yeah right especially like in and my arms my legs are just everywhere basically feeling quite lethargic and weak mentioned yeah pretty much okay and um april are you normally otherwise fit and well am i normally what fit and well so do you have any other medical history uh well i have type 2 diabetes okay i have quite high blood pressure okay would you take for your blood pressure any what medications you take on a regular basis sure um i take much much forman for the diabetes yep i take lisinopril for the high blood pressure so okay fine any allergies at all to medications no i just no okay regarding any family history is there anything i should be aware of my dad also has type 2 diabetes but i think that's it okay all right who's looking after your diabetes is it anyone do you have a doctor in hospital can you stop your diabetes i just regularly go see a doctor um and just checks up on it same with the high blood pressure like i i have it under control and since i started taking this medication i've just been like regularly checking that it's it's under control right excellent in terms of your social situation who lives at home with you uh just it's just me and my partner okay um fine is your partner well at the moment yeah he has none of this like he's just going ahead like like not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not just it's just me and my partner okay um fine is your partner well at the moment yeah he has none of this like he's just going ahead like like nothing like i was a bit worried that i would pass it to him but right okay not diarrhea nothing he's fine oh way he's got away with it at the moment okay and are you working at the moment april yeah i am working but the first day first day i skipped because i was feeling just too shit yeah but then i just felt like had to go back because i had so much to do i've been going in but it's not been fun no i can imagine what is it that you do for work i am a developer so you work in the it field okay work in it field right okay not too active a job no has been quite stressful recently not more than usual to know you're you're not feeling stressed um do you smoke at all april i used to but i've stopped for about six months now okay um and what about alcohol i mean yeah i don't think i drink that much like i i don't really know how you count the units but i guess like i don't drink more than like like say three evenings a week and i rarely get like properly drunk or anything what is it that you drink wine most likely and what how much do you drink on those nights i'd say like maybe two or three glasses okay so um yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of um the recommended limit something we should think about just because of your blood pressure and blood pressure and diabetes maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can yeah i love you everyone i think i should cut down on it really ideally the the right answer is to cut down completely but so in practice i know that's not realistic so maybe for the first few weeks one you cut down to two glasses a week and then one week thereafter um and if you are coping okay then we can maybe try and cut down altogether okay okay just something for you to think about right so just as we wrap up really april i think based on your story i think essentially i think you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness i don't think there's anything to worry about you know you've had a bit of a cough bit of a running nose feeling quite weak and lethargic i'm hoping that you know you're probably over the worst of it now it's been five days i'm hoping you'll maybe get better the next couple of days i'm hoping you're maybe going to get better the next couple of days and normally last about a week to ten days what what should i do if it just keeps going on and on like if it's still going on in say four days yeah absolutely so you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to you know get some nice good rest drink plenty of fluids keep yourself well hydrated you can take regular paracetamol if you feel like it's still not getting any better in two to three days it's probably worth coming back to see me again we can check you over and again we can check you over and if you are still feeling feverish and your cough isn't getting any better then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest which can sometimes be a common source of infection do you think i should keep going to work or do you think i should just yeah so i think you know really i think it depends on you it's if you are coughing then there is a theatrical you know risk that you're maybe slightly infectious you're maybe slightly infectious still so i would say maybe take a day or two of work if you can and get some good bed rest and maybe think about work early next week okay okay but if your cough isn't getting me better or your breathing is getting worse i want you to come back and see me sooner okay okay but otherwise i don't need to worry no nothing to worry about otherwise okay okay thank you very much have a good day appreciate it thank you bye
