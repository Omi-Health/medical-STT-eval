oh hello hi hi hey dan my name's joe i'm one of the doctors here at babylon can i have your name please yeah daniel hi daniel and your date of birth yeah 1992 92 okay daniel and uh are you in a comfortable and confidential place to talk yeah totally happy to go ahead great how can i help um yeah i just my chest has been feeling really tight okay and how long has this been going for dude for about three hours now okay 926 and you're any shortness of breath at all yeah like a little bit yeah a little bit short of breath not too bad any cough wheeze yeah i'm feeling a bit wheezy as well because of coffee coughing yeah sore yeah yeah sore throat running nose sore throat and it's not as bad as it was but yeah i had a cold last week and it's not as bad as it was but yeah i had a sore throat i had a running nose just feeling under the weather you're feeling better now other than the tight chest i mean i feel worse but the running nose isn't as bad anymore right okay okay but you know now you've got this this um so you've still got symptoms of a cold essentially yeah okay are you coughing up anything no and um do you have any other medical problems like asthma yeah yeah i have asthma i've had it for a hay fever you know some allergies to dust okay do you have any inhalers or any any medications um yeah so uh you know the um uh ventolin it's called uh salbutamol yeah i got that one and then i have a steroid uh clenil clenil inhaler clenil modulate yeah okay yeah yeah and um uh have you been using clonil and the ventolin and how often have you been using them um well to be honest i was away at uni last week and i forgot to bring it with me so i haven't really in the past week because because um sorry they ran out and i forgot to go and grab the next one yeah yeah sure all right all right so so you haven't got any clinil or any ventilin at the moment not with me right now no i ran out okay all right um any any drug allergies you know no no not allergic to anything just like just the dust and stuff but nothing no drugs okay great now uh do you anyone in your family had any medical problems um yeah my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma and oh when i was young i also had eczema and i had a milk protein allergy when i was young too okay um right so just uh do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or hopes for this consultation and not really like i feel like asthma's probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers would be helpful um it's just kind of scary because i haven't had a time like this where i've been so tight in a long time yeah absolutely i can i can imagine um well it certainly sounds like uh you've had this cold you've got wheezy with a cough um and it's non-productive cough and you're short of breath is the cough worse at night time i mean it gets a little bit worse at night but basically just pretty consistent yeah it hasn't gone away okay okay and you've got this tight tight chest but you even say you've got chest pain but it's more of a tight chest isn't it no not really pain it's more like tight it just feels like sometimes you can't get a full breath in you know yeah sure um okay well i i would quite like to uh certainly get you some uh bentolyn clean or modulate have you had asthma exacerbations in the past not in a long time when i was young a little bit more like back in high school but i've been pretty good at taking my my inhalers so not not so much anymore have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient as in you know stayed in there overnight for asthma yeah when i was in high school i had to have a tube put in my throat oh okay so you uh you had you went to hospital and had a uh you so you stayed in hospital for a few days did you with an asthma exacerbation yeah i did yeah okay but currently you're just on ventolin and clenil and you haven't got any of those steroids those inhalers in the house yeah i've been pretty good i've been pretty good just on the clenil and the salbutamol yeah when sorry how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation uh deterioration i think i was like 17 16 80 okay just to quantify how short of breath you are i don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you no you won't have one are you able to like walk up flight of stairs okay walk on stairs okay walking the flat okay without getting too short of breath or are you short of breath at rest i'm definitely not short of breath at rest like except for that feeling i was describing it does when i'm walking upstairs i do feel like i have a little bit more short of breath than i would normally be yeah okay but you're not short of breath at rest at the moment no no no i'm not okay fine so what i what i think um and just just to what i think um and just just to go over is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the uh a prescription for your inhaler was there anything else that you typed back in from this i just want to know that i'm okay to just like keep i just don't want to have to get um that that intervention again sure yeah absolutely well i'm really glad you spoke to me today i think what we can do is is give you a prescription for uh some more of the inhalers we can get that to you within the hour i would hope and i think the other thing i'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids so these are tablets which you can take for five days two tablets in the morning and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response okay now there are now there are some side effects to the steroids which i should really tell you about but please read the label it's associated with don't be too worried about the side effects they're on most you know most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated and you probably do you have had them in the past do you know sorry sorry you were cutting in and out a little bit there what were you saying have you had steroids in the past um i can't remember probably probably yeah i would like to hear yeah so um they they can come they can make your your mood change can be slightly low or slightly high can give you a high blood sugar um and uh that uh they can also cause rash as you're um headaches but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help you out so um uh what i'd like to do is is send you these the some prescriptions for your uh inhalers are ongoing so um you can once you get better from this asthma attack you can you can use the clenil modulate in the morning with ventolin as a prn but so a ventolin when you need to um when you're getting noisy if you should start to use the ventilin more than every three hours at any time it's a good idea to seek medical attention so see a doctor in some capacity and the other thing i'd like to send you is a spacer which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better have you do you know what a spacer is have you used one before yeah yeah i somebody told me yeah yeah i somebody told me how to use one a while ago i don't i don't really use it to be honest but have you got one i think i do i have one somewhere okay all right well um i'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it but essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside breathing in and out um for five or ten breaths okay yeah so was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about the stage i think you got me covered okay um and uh i might give you some time off work as well you can self-certify for seven days but uh i think i would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better if you're okay all right all right well thank you very much no worsening of your symptoms like worsening shortness of breath or just generally concerning symptoms uh pain in your chest tightness uh feeling lightheaded uh then seek further medical attention and please okay all right sounds good okay thank you okay thank you bye bye
