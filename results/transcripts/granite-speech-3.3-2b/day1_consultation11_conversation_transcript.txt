hello hello hello can you hear me okay i can hear you but i can't really see you that's perfect um is that okay am i meant to just this connection on the screen it's audio and no it's absolutely fine okay now before i go any further can i confirm your name and your age um so um my name is uh dan chaudry i am seven twenty seven twenty seven okay and how can i help you today then dan um so i've just um been having some troubles basically in uh it's uh i guess it's been a little while now and i've just been feeling not so great and it's all come from like uh it's like basically i think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out like loads of it like i go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it yeah it doesn't feel very solid it's just it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's uh yeah it's just uh not not being very pleasant and like i just it just kind of has doesn't doesn't feel like it's getting better so well no sorry to so wow no sorry i hear that i'm like there's a lot going on there when did it all start you simpsons um so i think it was a few when i think about it so monday tuesday i saw i think it was about three it's been about three days now okay and it's in many diarrhea so you mentioned watery stools um how many times are you would say um so i i feel like it's like almost every hour when i'm awake um right well okay so you're losing a lot of fluid there yeah so i mean i'm i'm trying to drink a lot of water but um yeah it's just quite a lot and uh it's yeah i think i i feel like it's just just fluids coming out okay have you just any blood in your stools um so i no i don't remember anything like no i i think it's just i nothing like that there's nothing like that and any any tummy pain any any any pain in your tummy but yeah i mean i i feel i feel a cramp and then and then i know it's time to go right so around every hour i just feel something come up and feel something come up and then i have to go so yeah i mean that's that's the kind of the first sign where is this crampy pain which part of your tummy it's kind of i want to if i think about it it's like it's like at the bottom i don't know if that makes sense what do we start with is it is it in the middle or is it to one particular side um i think if it feels pretty like in like in the middle to me not on any side left or right okay and does this pain come and go or is it there constantly um it comes and goes it comes and goes fine okay and if i was asking to get a one to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever had how bad is this pain okay so what do you mean by uh pain so i i think it's pain doesn't make me double over is it 10 is it 10 out of 10 the worst pain you've ever had or is it more of a kind of a mild pain like a 3 out of 10 i i guess so i'm when i think about it like when i get it i can pretend that i don't feel it so i can still sit down and i can still like cover it up and people don't really notice so i don't know what that means but maybe is that like a six or a seven okay all right good um apart from the pain and diarrhea any other symptoms like nausea vomiting um yeah definitely i definitely feel kind of nauseous um like i and like i have vomited i mean when i like i think it's maybe something to do with like whenever i have like milk maybe something to do with like whenever i have like milk or something like that i just feel like i want to vomit and actually like yeah one time i just like had some milk and i just completely vomited it okay i've been trying to avoid it but um yeah the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea is that right um sorry could you repeat that the vomiting is not as uh prominent as the diarrhea is that right i know no it's not okay okay all right um any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures um so yeah i think i'm pretty i feel kind of really hot all the time and um i pretty sure i'm burning up i haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that but it's yeah i've i'm sure i'm i'm not uh like not a normal temperature okay so you're feeling hot okay in terms of your water works are you passing urine okay um yeah but i guess less frequently maybe um but yeah it seems to be okay okay always um fine and you said mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off are you aware of any triggers i mean have you for example gone out had some takeaway food have you been around anyone else and with my erea for example um so i know so my um my brother has had actually had something like this for um he has it as well for five days as well um and i i'm not yeah i can't think of what what the trigger is for me i mean my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me but yeah that's right he's a is your brother now better um he so he's been like this for five days i think he's getting better but i'm not i'm not really sure he said he had he's had something for a little while as well okay always are you having anything to eat a drink i can see you're drinking your coffee but are you keeping it down are you keeping your fluids down um so it just feels like um the the the fluids do go down but it just feels like it's going straight through just feels like it's going straight through okay always fine when was the last time you had anything solid to eat which kept which which you kept in um so i had some i mean i had some lunch today um but again it just it did just come out pretty loose okay all right um and and dan moving forwards are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical history um so i um yeah i think i think otherwise um fitting well i um yeah i mean i i'm an okay way and um i i can't think of any related medical history um i mean like my yeah i no i don't think so i take you don't take any regular medications and so i um no i mean i i've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately but i haven't been i'm not on any regular medication or anything like that okay and okay and do you have any allergies or any medications um so i don't have any allergies that i know of okay and what about any family history do you have any family history of bowel problems um bowel so with bowel like just is the colon like something yeah so what i mean by bowel is a whole gut really anything from the mouth to the intestines so my yeah my my dad actually has colon cancer at the moment oh dear i'm really sorry to hear that how is he so um from what i heard he's kind of so i don't i don't speak to him that often so i don't i don't know the exact details and i don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing but um he's sort of in his third stage uh i'm not sure what that means exactly um yeah yeah so yeah it's it's um he's yeah you can i can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting him a lot and um all that sort of thing so it's quite i guess he's um had it for a little while now so i'm sorry i'll make a note of that because it's always important to know these kind of details um and socially tell me more about your home situation who's at home with you dan um so uh not my brother he doesn't live with me i'm i live with my um sister and my mom okay and uh how things are home um jenny what sense do you mean that in general day-to-day life are you managing okay any particular stressors i mean uh i think uh yeah it's been it's been tricky um going to work with all of this um i dislike um taking time off work i feel like i i just want to go um when i can so i i try and go um i think at home uh yeah i just haven't really um i i i don't normally actually eat with my family i normally i'm buying stuff and that kind of thing so i don't think it's affected them and i haven't really been haven't really gone into detail with my sister about it um yeah i i just rather deal with these things um so what you mentioned work what you mentioned work where is it you do uh for like socially but not like regularly um so normally if it's a friday or something like that i might i might have a cigarette something like that but um not next question sorry and alcohol so alcohol um i you know i might have a beer during the weekdays maybe not many maybe um but on fridays i have more um alcohol um yeah i love more units um on a i suppose um not every week but maybe uh once or twice a month that yeah i go out with my friends and we'll drink a lot so that that's um yeah sharing with me that's very helpful tonight so um dan just as a uh conclusion um just to wrap it all up i think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis okay a bit of a basically infection of your tummy of your gut there's nothing to worry about i'm i i suspect this will just settle down in the next few days just like i did for your brother drink make sure you drink plenty of fluids okay um you can just drink like normal water i just feel like every time i drink it's just coming out um your fluids probably just but i am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins um so you can get things like diolite which is um a fluid replacement you can get from the pharmacy it's probably worth recommending that do i need like a prescription for that and no you can just get over the counter okay over counter okay um you can try just you know regular paracetamol if you're feeling feverish but if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days say 48 hours i want you to give me a call back because um you know if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations okay but i think let's let's see how you are over the next one to two days okay and we'll catch up soon okay okay so you're saying that i should i could i'll try and buy this diary like what that i should i could i'll try and do this diary like what should i do in terms of um food and that kind of thing should i just go for fluids food dissolve yeah absolutely so clear fluids you can use soft diet things like soup mash and then gradually build up as much as your body can tolerate um but really let's try and keep yourself well hydrated first okay okay is it okay for me to carry on having like um paracetamol and things like that absolutely if you're having if you've got a bit of tummy pain if you're feeling feverish then i think paracetamol is very sensible okay okay try and avoid alcohol if you can uh okay i'll try yeah okay all right then okay thank you for your help all right thank you very much thanks thanks
