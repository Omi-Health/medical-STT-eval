this morning are you having this morning okay all right all right okay um a couple of things i'd like to do in order to try and get an idea of how unwell you are okay um the first okay the first thing i'd like to do is to try and measure your pulse so the way we're going to do this is that if you if i can get you to try and locate the pulse on your wrist okay not everyone can do this so don't worry if you can't but if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse it's just under the thumb if you put your fingers up and down like that you might be able to feel the pulse i've got it you've got it okay you're sure all sure yeah all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting okay so i'll just get my stopwatch up okay so if you can um you've still got the pulse yep okay so if you're going to stop now i think that was about 11 or 12 so that would make your heart rate about 66 to 74 that's okay good fantastic the next thing i'd like you to try and do okay it depends on the lighting so it may not be possible but the next thing i'd like you to try and do is just get you to squeeze the tip of your finger and then let me of your finger and then let me see how quickly the redness comes back okay so if you can see what i'm doing now my fingers come right behind the screen i'm squeezing it okay just watch me first so just watch me first yeah i'm squeezing it and then you can see that it goes pale and it goes back to the normal red color okay so if i can get you just to put your finger up to your camera and then with the other hand just try and squeeze it and you know you've got very good breathing circulation okay perfect that's great thank you so much the last thing i'd like to do is i'd like to try and have a look down your throat okay are you doing this consultation via a phone or a laptop phone a phone i've rested it on my laptop so i think we're good to go sorry say that again okay so if you if you position your device up above your head put your head back mouth open wide and let me see if i can have it that's fantastic and say ah perfect thank you for that excellent okay last thing is if i can get you to feel inside your neck just on the sides here okay buy your adam's apple tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not no they feel pretty normal to me okay thank you all right now um sorry i've forgotten your name um doris doris okay doris um what what i think we need to do is um this sounds like you might have a chest infection okay if you're coughing up blood and you're feeling your heart racing um uh i think you need to be examined today someone needs to listen to your chest and um maybe check your blood pressure as well and check that you're stable i have to say examining you now from what limited examination i could do online your everything does seem to be okay in terms of you you don't seem acutely unstable however if you've got this kind of pain um when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood we um when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood we do we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have pneumonia or chest infection and um that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope and you may need um an antibiotic this is one thing i need to ask you have you been on any long haul flight recently no no okay have you ever had any clots in your legs or clots in your lungs blood clots not that i know of no no okay anyone in the family have that no no okay all right um what i think we'll do is um we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today okay um i would like someone to listen to your chest and to check your blood pressure and to recheck your pulse as well just make sure and check your temperature make sure all those parameters are okay you may well need an antibiotic okay um do you have any allergies to any antibiotics no no okay um i no okay i'm not going to prescribe anything for you now because i think you need to have that basic assessment first before we proceed to the next step but that's what i would predict the next step might be i'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment for you to ring our support team and then they will book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our gps today and then they'll do that assessment and then we'll take it from there okay but we don't think i'm dying of lung cancer given the way in which you have presented now just one day with a fever and this slight pain concurrent with the blood and the phlegm that's not usually how lung cancer presents it's more insidious over a longer period of time with other symptoms however we might need to get some investigations to get some investigations to exclude that it depends on the examination finding we'll see you okay are you worried about lung cancer well you know if you start coughing up blood and you think you're going to die of lung cancer of course yeah so just remind me how old you are again i'm sorry 45 45 okay it's something we do need to be cognizant of okay um and we may end up having to do a follow-up chest x-ray if things don't settle down but at the moment it seems more but at the moment it seems more like a chest infection rather than a lung cancer that's good to know yeah that is good to know yes it's easier to treat but we still need to make sure that things are okay because chest infections can become an asthma as well it can lead to infection inside the body we want to avoid that as well so let's get you checked out today and hopefully we can put you to mind rest and get you on the right course of treatment perfect thank you very much all right you're welcome all right take care then all the best bye
