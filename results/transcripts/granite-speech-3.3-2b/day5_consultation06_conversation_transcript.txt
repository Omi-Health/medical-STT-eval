not going but like to the touch i'm like literally burning okay and any nausea or vomiting yes i've been throwing up i can't keep to i can't seem to be able to keep anything in me not even water not even my tea not even any liquid stuff i've just been throwing up everything okay and when when were you last sick um i was sick just after trying to have breakfast this morning so maybe about two hours ago okay and have you been passing water okay yeah i've been i've been yeah urinating okay is that what you mean yeah urinating yeah any what sort of color is the urine to be honest i wanted to know how to look so i really couldn't okay and when did you last pass urine and you think um at least an hour ago okay and any blood in the stool or in the urine that you've noticed no blood okay any episodes like this before how's your bowels is normally fine i would normally go to the toilet every day you know and is there anything you think might have triggered this off have you been abroad anywhere but then um my um my brother um has actually been having similar symptoms um for the past um few days as few days as well and it does say like everyone is gross gross so i don't know that might that might be from him so you've been in contact with him have you yes okay um and any other medical problems no no rush no nothing bad okay um any surgery before or abdominal problems or any other medical issues well apart from the fact that this one is giving me abdominal pains no previous abdominal pains before also i get the odd um you know menstrual cramps and all that but you know that's you know that comes and goes okay and whereabouts is the pain that you're getting um it's kind of like towards my navel area like i can't touch my navel area it's just so sore i mean that's yeah towards the center of my navel um and does the pain come and go yes it does come when it comes i feel the strong urge to go to the to the loo and then sort of releases me and sort of like comes again becomes okay um and do you know i have a pain from time to time and do you take any other drugs no like i said i only take um vitamins um for my menstrual comes when it comes maybe i might take a and i've been just to eat the tea and when was when was your last period um two weeks ago okay are you on any contraception no okay and what's your job um um uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh u and who do you live with at home i live with my brother and my mom okay and um have you tried anything yourself for this problem well i've had a home remedy um can you just repeat that the ores the the salt sugar forest um um mix the salt sugar mix okay and how often have you been taking that i've taken that i've taken that like um three times a day for the past two days okay um and do you feel like your symptoms are easing or for getting worse or to be honest i i i'm not getting any better because like i said i've been i've been vomiting literally everything i take so so i doubt that even that has had this chance to work okay um i mean it sounds like because your brother's had a similar thing it sounds like it might be some an infectious gastroenteritis gastrenteritis that you've got which is usually caused by a virus but it can be from something you've eaten as well if the symptoms they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts if the symptoms are continuing to get worse the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough sometimes you do require certain medication to help this if it's sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria what i would say is probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not sun to ease off i think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment okay and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated because if you're if you're not keeping fluid down then you can get dehydrated and so how do i how do i get myself hydrated when i'm not able to even like drink or temper one of everything yeah so you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts it's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago so you obviously still um hydrated enough to pass urine but we um we should see you so that we can check your hydration and um get that sample sent off as soon as possible because if if you come into the clinic you can send that sample off straight away otherwise we would have to post it out to you which would take time okay so when can i come to the clinic to have this um so we can we can make you an urgent appointment um and then you can you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration um but if in the meantime if you're feeling more unwell then we would get you seen urgently in amy okay so you could call us back in the meantime okay so while i'll do yeah if you could please book me the appointment and um yeah i'll see how i feel um before the end of the day hopefully i don't need to go to amy and yeah keep drinking keep going with tiny sips constantly so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and you vomit so just tiny sips but just keep going with it and just have very simple food if you're going to have anything like toast or biscuit or something really light like that avoid fruit vegetables milk anything like that which might just make it worse okay okay so you'll have to book an appointment through the support line yes please right okay we'll do that for you fine okay take care thank you thanks bye
