hello hi my name is dr jacob and welcome to babylon how are you i'm i'm i'm good i mean okay i'm um so i'm bad yourself okay right so just before we start is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please how about and your date of birth 17th of january 1987 and your address for me please uh 60 and over steps um that's good and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation yes okay so you mentioned in our notes that you've got um skin problem if you can tell me a bit more about it please yes over the past few days i had noticed my skin is sore and red okay so where is it sore and red it's all over my chest my hands and arms especially inside of on the inside of the elbows okay inside of the elbows yeah which is the worst area all right the worst area is it very itchy it's very itchy and dry okay have you had something like this in the past yes yes i have a had eczema in the past okay do you think this is similar to your usual eczema or lexum or is it worse i think it's it's yeah it's going worse like this past few days yeah but you could be like something similar so on your skin is there any you know any of the patches uh so are you mentioning it's quite sore is it weeping is it like watery liquid coming from that area weeping no nothing that was noticed okay right so are there cracks crack yeah so you have cracks over there okay and is there any scratch marks on your on any of the you know areas any scratch marks i mean uh it's very easy to scratch myself but there's no scratch back okay is there any thickened skin like you know where it's the skin's very um thick and darkened areas no no i don't see i no i don't think i don't think so okay right here so you've mentioned you've got a history of eczema so what do you do about it how do you keep it under control yeah usually yeah use a cream called deprobase in the shower i use something called dermo dermo all right and have you been using them recently or not yes i use them every day yes there's no change in that i didn't change any okay have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema um i'm not sure yes yes i've yes you use it but it's not helping yeah also you're still using the steroids yeah i tried i tried which one are you using the steroids what's the name i'm not sure it's uh i would have to look it up the pills it's not there okay so is it like the over-the-counter ones sorry over-the-counter hydrocoritason that does that ring a bell yep yeah so you're using the hydrocoritason yeah are you using any antihistamines at all no no no antihistamines okay right fine otherwise other than the rash you're feeling well in yourself there's no temperature no joint pains yeah you don't take no i will because i've tried those on cetaminine didn't work you've tried the antihistamines and didn't work okay which one did you try the one over the counter okay so like cetirizine yeah okay that's fine right okay so from what you're describing it looks like you know it is quite widespread your chest and hands and things like that um so do you have any allergies to any medication at all no no allergies no allergies okay and you don't other than eczema you don't have any other medical conditions i have asthma and in my mother has migraine and what was the other one i didn't understand who has hypothyroidism my mother okay so she has hypothyroidism okay that's fine right you you mentioned you have asthma so what medications are you using for asthma um you know probably naloxone so you don't you don't use it every day so you just use it on and off yeah yeah yeah it's only when i'm sick it's only when i have a flare so what we need to do is obviously you've got extensive as i've mentioned so extensive eczema what we'll do you need a couple of things because to keep you would probably need some antihistamines which i'm going to prescribe also hydrocoritason is a baby steroids that you use for young children you might probably need a bit more stronger one like betnorage or something like that okay so we'll try that first so i'm going to it's called the antihistamine is called fexofenadine and then we'll try with some betnorage first so it's like very small amount like it's like one fingertip yeah this much is is enough to cover your palms and your back of your hands yeah so it's very small amount so that if you can imagine you can cover with very small amount the whole body yeah so use that you have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks okay okay if if there's no improvement you need to get back to improvement you need to get back to us or if you have any kind of adverse reaction like an allergic reaction which is unlikely but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us okay okay so what we're going to do is we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy it looks like boots on the systems is that correct yeah yes yes so i'll send it across to boots i won't be there for collecting if things are getting worse in the next two weeks call us beforehand otherwise wait for two weeks take the medication and the cream you still need to continue on your emollients like the dermal soap and as well as the tissue provider yeah so you still need to use those in the interim any questions at all no no questions thank you you take care then bye bye
