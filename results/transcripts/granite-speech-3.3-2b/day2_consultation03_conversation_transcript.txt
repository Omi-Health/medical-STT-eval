numbness down in the rest of the body at all no no no nothing like that okay have you had any difficulty swallowing no and have you had any difficulty speaking have you noticed any problems with your vision at all no that's all good okay and do you have the numbness present right now yeah it's kind of kind of there quite often so it's not all the time so yeah right now it feels very doesn't feel like when i touch this side of my face sure sure okay all right um just going back to the kind of muffled hearing feeling in the ear um do you have any discharge coming from that ear at all no nothing nothing coming out any pain in the air or from the air uh no right okay and um have you had any fever at all no nothing like that and do you um have any itchiness in the ears do you use cotton buds to kind of clean your ears out i don't oh no no don't um do you need to ask a few other general questions um do you have any other illnesses at all um i've well i've got kind of been told i had polyps in my nose in the past and occasionally get some kind of half anny feeling um that's all fine and you know take a rennie's if i need to and if my nose polyps are playing up i've got a spray um other than that i think they said ages ago i had something called start off i remember but lab prin- something like that but again nothing nothing on the- sure okay so are you on any regular medication you mentioned the spray for your nose yeah so no i only take the spray for my nose when i need it for and um sometimes i get oh like rennie's but i just get that from the chemist sure and the spray for your nose where'd you get that from was that from a doctor yeah they gave me gave me a prescription ages ago yeah do you remember the name of the spray all right unfortunately i don't sorry that's all right that's good and you're not on any other medication at all no okay do you have any any allergies to any medication uh no just latex latex okay right let's continue um and um in terms of your family are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all my brother had neurofibromatosis fibromyositis i think it is and in terms of your own kind of background now are you working at the moment yeah so i'm a i'm a jockey um but because of all the kind of symptoms of the game especially sometimes when i get a ringing i feel a bit dizzy um i've just had to do far less training so kind so kind of beginning to yeah impacting work um a little bit now okay so you have to excuse my ignorance you mean jockey like with horses is that what you're talking about yeah oh right okay fine um great um and do you live alone um i uh live with my partner okay right um is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what's been going on recently uh no so what what what i think we've gone it was just like there was one thing i think just because i can panic and you can look online and get a bit frantic i guess what i'm trying to think is you know is there something particularly serious that you know would need to be sorted and obviously reading anything can make you really frantic is it is it hopefully nothing i so serious i would die from it i don't know i just i think okay so um uh obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via video portal but um from what you've told me this doesn't seem to be you know anything um that you're going to die from however i would like you to be assessed in a clinic today okay i would like you to come into one of my clinics i'd like gp to assess you yes what you're describing might be something called bell's palsy okay um we can go into that explaining what that is if um if that's confirmed on on physical examination um that's not usually a life threatening problem but um part of the reason why i'd like you to come in is just that we can just do what we call a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on and confirm whether that might be the diagnosis have a look have a look inside the ear see if there's any anything probably anything to see within the ear so in answer to your question no i don't think that you need to worry about that i think you know preliminarily i can i can reassure you however to know in order to definitively reassure you i think you need a physical examination today okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to send a message to admin team i'll ask them to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics within central london okay and then you can ring okay and then you can ring this uh the support team number i'll leave that number in your notes you can ring them after five minutes and then they'll slot you into a place that's convenient for you okay that's fine correct so someone will will see you and hopefully will be able to reassure you further but please make sure the appointment gets done today okay yep they will do it that's fine thank you very much all right then okay nice to see you take care bye bye
