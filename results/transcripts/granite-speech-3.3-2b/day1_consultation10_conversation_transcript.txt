hello hello hi can you hear me okay yeah i can hear you right excellent before i go any further can i confirm your name and your age please sure um i'm manda jackson and i'm 19 years old 19 years old okay manda and how can i help you this afternoon um so it's been going on for a few days now um it's not happened before and i'm a bit bit worried i was quite hurt when i kind of pee um and yeah it's like i'm going to the toilet a lot more um and it's really like i can't like go to uni properly i'm just like constantly looking for the toilet um and it kind of hurts sometimes when i'm like in the bottom of my tummy as well all right i'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and i can see why it's affecting you um so you mentioned you've been going for the last three days mainly the burning pain when so you mentioned you've been bleeding for the last three days mainly the burning pen when you pass urine um you're going to the toilet more often as well that right uh yeah it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days i think actually maybe just under a week oh on the week sorry sorry no i i didn't explain it properly before um yeah no i it's been going on for about just under a week um and yeah i've noticed sort of burning stinging when i go to the toilet yeah i've noticed any anything new urine for company blood or discoloration of urine i think what today i noticed it was like a bit pink the urine i think it was pink i don't know it was pink so okay fine we'll have to definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on you also mentioned some tummy pain as well can you tell me a bit more about that pain yeah it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy mainly when i go to the loo i think that's when it's worse can you describe it as a crampy pe pain is it more of a burning pain um i wouldn't describe it as crampy i don't think it's like a period pain it's a bit different it's hard to say an achy pain i suppose achy pain okay does it pain move anywhere else does it move towards your back towards your sides no no okay all right um any other symptoms at all if for example nausea vomiting no i don't know if i'm saying okay any temperatures or fevers um no not that noticed okay all right and how are your bowels are your bowels working okay uh i i usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway so i don't think it's any different okay and what what easily is we wouldn't say you have problems what kind of problems do you normally have um i think i have um ibs um so i just kind of pass my bowels out quite quite a lot um and sometimes it's quite it's quite variable like sometimes it's a bit softer sometimes it's a bit it's sorry it's a bit disgusting but like yeah it's it's it's a bit disgusting but like yeah it's it's it's a bit disgusting but like yeah it's it's it's a bit disgusting but like yeah it's it's it's a bit disgusting but like yeah it's it's it's a bit disgusting but like yeah it's it's it's a bit disgusting but like yeah it's it's it's a bit disgusting but like yeah it's it's it's a bit disgusting but okay all right but you've noticed no new symptoms no no no new symptoms in your bowels no no not all right um and amanda sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions as you can imagine um can i ask are you currently uh are you currently sexually active no i'm the uh yeah um i have a long-term um boyfriend okay and um have you noticed any other discharge from down below so from from the front passage no no i don't think so nothing unusual okay have you do you use any form of contraception uh yeah um i'm um on the pill the pill what kind of pill is it the combined pill or the mini pill uh combined pill okay fine um when was the last time you had um unprotected sex i mean i mean unprotected is it like no no condoms or anything yeah absolutely i guess because i i don't really use condoms with my boyfriend like i don't know we've just kind of we've just kind of agreed uh so uh i guess a week ago okay all right i guess what i'm trying to get at is whether um there's any chance you could be pregnant at all i know you're on the pill but we we we we do have to ask um when was your last when was your last period um two weeks ago two weeks ago okay all right just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better okay um fine in terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you eating and drinking okay uh yeah yeah eating drinking okay um i did have one kind of concern i don't know so i smoked uh this is quite bad but i smoked weed for the first time like a week and a half ago and i just wonder whether it's and i just wonder whether it's related at all probably not but i just thought i'd get some advice from you sure well thanks for sharing with me so i don't think it's is related to your symptoms i think it's probably just a pure coincidence but you know i do strongly advise you to you know make it a regular habit if you can just for your general health moving forwards okay um fine moving on in terms of your health otherwise do you have any other medical conditions apart from the ibs is there anything else i should be aware of no no okay great and were there any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the um combined pill apart from the pill um i take um something for the ibs as well um it begins with an n it's pretty hard to pronounce like m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m- now it's like maybe something yeah okay yeah yeah that's it yeah yeah and do you have any allergies any medications yeah i think that was an antibiotic um called clindamycin i think i took like a couple years ago something and yeah that that didn't that didn't go too well right okay sure i'll make a note of that um in terms of family history any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys no no we don't want to do anything else good and socially tell me a bit more about your home situation who's at home with you um so i am living in halls at the moment uni so i'm just living with a flatmate i suppose but my family uh live kind of outside of london not too far away um so yeah my family are fine and i see them now and then very good yeah thanks i think i think they're okay generally great and are you still in university i'm studying english for english okay good and how are you enjoying your course yeah yeah it's it's going well thanks just thanks just kind of started a few months ago a few months ago yeah i really enjoy it very good very good um in terms of smoking and alcohol do you do you participate in either uh as i admitted before i tried weed the first time uh but i don't smoke uh i drink occasionally um kind of socially um with friends okay what what just made you have your first joint last week was it um i was just a party um there were other people doing it um i kind of was a little bit tipsy so probably wasn't thinking quite straight um but yeah i completely agree it's not something i want to get into on a regular basis sure and obviously as your doctor's i'm here to look after you so i would strongly recommend you you know to avoid it great great um fine so this is i wouldn't normally examine you but i think based on your story i think um you know i'm reassured by the fact i i think it's um probably just a simple what we say a uti or a cystitis bladder infection um you know you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me there's anything to worry about so things like fevers and back pain um would be more worrying sorry for me to hear so something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics so we've got choice of two antibiotics something called trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin which is a three day course normally they're usually quite effective for your symptoms it's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well if you can so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there start the antibiotics make sure you're well hydrated drink plenty of fluids if you are having some pain simple parasiticum would probably be advisable we'll see what the urine sample shows and if it is indeed positive we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones but if things are still looking any better next week come back and see me and we can have another look again okay okay great um with the urine sample and how do i go about doing that so you know well that's a good question so i will give you i will organize for you to come in and drop off a sample one of my practices which we can test there and then and whether you're indian and send it off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results okay perfect okay perfect okay great do bear in mind those symptoms i mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting if you have any of those give me a call okay see you at breakfast yeah okay have a good day okay great thank you too bye
