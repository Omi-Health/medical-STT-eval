probably but not straight um and my ears are buzzing a bit it i'm just filling a bit off okay here's bazy so when did it all start started probably about two hours ago maybe but i i um i had a similar sort of thing about a month ago um but i didn't really think anything of it because it's it settled quite quickly um but this has been going for a bit more now okay so you said you mentioned it started a few hours ago so what did it start what were you doing um i was actually making my husband some breakfast um and i yeah i just suddenly felt very fuzzy and dizzy um and a bit shaky okay so as you mentioned it's like the room spinning around yeah okay and oh is it there now continuously now yeah it's there now for the past two hours you'd say yeah yeah okay did you have any kind of viral illness in the recent past past couple of weeks no no cold cough nothing no i've been pretty healthy i think um yeah yeah okay um you mentioned that you have some ear buzzing kind of thing any kind of ear pain or ear discharge anything like that no nothing okay do you have a temperature at all i don't think so um okay right you also mentioned that you can walk but you're not walking straight why is that is it because i think just because the room feels like it's moving a bit um it feels like the room is that's why you feel it feels like the room that's why you feel like you're a bit unsteady my my legs and arms and everything are working fine i just i don't feel like i'm sort of stable my the room is spinning so there's no weakness of your arms and legs okay okay right um so you mentioned you had something like this a month ago so how how how long did that episode last for probably only about five ten minutes okay right and do you have any problems hearing at the moment like is it muffled or something it's just a bit of a buzzy noise in my ears but otherwise i can hear everything okay right you okay so have you been physically sick no but i am feeling very sick research nausea okay right here and i don't have much information of your past medical history so if there any medical conditions you'd like to tell me surgical medical conditions um i've had premature ovarian failure um and i've taken hrt okay pregnancy and pregnancy ovarian failure okay and um any other medications at all no okay do you have any allergies at all no okay right okay so talking to you today um in the most common um you know diagnosis we would say we are suffering from at the moment is something called labyrinthitis yeah okay that's when your middle ear there is some inflammation going on there and there is some imbalances in the crystals there in your middle ear okay so what the most important treatment is actually giving you some kind of middle ear steroids so that you won't feel as if you're going around in a boat kind of feeling okay so that's what we need to start because to actually make you able because to actually make you able to function a bit more we'll start you on certain medications i would still like you to be seen by one of our doctors to take a look inside your ears to just make sure so this is like just symptomatic relief like if you have a fever we just give paracetamol so just to you know make you able to come and see one of the doctors and things like that while you're with the doctors we'd like to do your blood pressure just examine your mean you're you know you know how you're walking and everything is okay while we're waiting while you're waiting on seeing the doctor if you develop any weakness of your legs or arms or or you know a sudden headache any of those symptoms or you start being violently sick with it then you know you would need to take yourself to a ne okay but if not wait for the appointment for the doctor to examine you and we'll take it from there so i'll send the prescription across to your pharmacy it looks like it's the lloyd pharmacy on our system is that correct yes yeah so we'll send you across that prescription it's called cetil yep it's one tablet three times a day so i'll give you for about 10 days worth in the interim obviously in in the interim obviously in the next few days you'll get to see one of our doctors and we'll have to just take it from there okay thank you so much any questions at all um can you take do you need to take those tablets with food or can you just take them anytime it doesn't really matter you can take it because sometimes you know you get the symptoms as soon as you wake up so probably you feel a bit sick to eat and things so i might as well just take the tablets okay that's great thank you so much that's so helpful just make sure you call support to book that appointment okay i will thank you very much bye bye
