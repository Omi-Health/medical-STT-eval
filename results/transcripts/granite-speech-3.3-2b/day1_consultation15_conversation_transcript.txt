you this afternoon uh soreness in my fingers and my fingers like the skin on my hands is kind of cracked okay when when did this all start um a couple of months ago like three four months ago three to morrow because it's been that long has it yeah okay and so you mentioned your the is it the skin on your hands mainly that's dry yeah i haven't noticed i mean i have i have dryness like you know in other parts like my legs but it's not it's not very it's not severe it's just you know i've always you know i don't hydrate very much so right okay yeah like it's very it's very bad in my head okay can i ask why have you come to see me today is it because it's got worse recently your symptoms yeah i mean it's gone to a point where where where it hurts a lot and i can't really do my job so i thought i should probably get it checked out yeah that's not like a very sensible plan um and which part of your hands are affected mainly uh the palm okay all right um have you noticed any itchiness in your palms yeah it's itchy not all the time but yeah it does get itchy okay any bleeding at all uh i don't i mean no i don't think scratching yourself you scratching yourself off and then bleeding um yeah i guess when i scratched it yes it has but sometimes but yeah otherwise it hasn't bled on its own okay um fine uh okay okay sorry i'm just going to write some notes as we go along and you mentioned the skin is quite cracked as well is that right yes that's great okay all right um i know it's a long time ago but do you remember how it all started what were you doing at the time when it all started anything you may have done to bring your symptoms on uh i mean i am i do work as a housekeeper keyboard um and to be honest i'm not always very good about wearing gloves um so that i couldn't be sure but um i switched jobs uh four months ago i've been working for as a housekeeper for for a while though but um that's the only thing i can think of yeah i think that might be quite important actually i think that's definitely maybe a correlation between the two um fine and so you mentioned something about having general dryness is that you mentioned your legs as well yeah is that is that sorry is that something you've you've had for a while now yeah it's not really it's not really major yeah it's just a little bit of dryness in my legs right okay okay i'm just going to ask you some very brief yes or and no questions i was okay with your symptoms have you have you any other symptoms such as fever or temperatures any nausea or any vomiting any problems with your bowels any problems with your urine or water works otherwise you feel well do you and yourself you're eating and drinking your appetite is well maintained yeah i feel good okay all right fine um in terms of your past medical history do you have any other conditions at all i have diabetes do you know if it's type 1 or type 2 type 2 diabetes okay anything else um any skin problems eczema yes excma dermatitis for example no that i know of no i haven't been diagnosed no okay which medications do you take no problem okay do you have any allergies either to any medications or in general okay family history wise is there anything i should be aware of diabetes and what diabetes beets as well yeah okay again any skin problems uh no not that i know any history of asthma or bowel problems uh no okay all right um fine in terms of social history you mentioned that you work as a housekeeper um and you're not always very good at wearing gloves um you recently changed jobs which what which kind of places you work in is it mainly residential or is it commercial uh hotel hotel yeah i usually use bath for bathrooms but yeah bedrooms and corridors not always okay have your symptoms stopped you from doing any work have you had to take time off work recently uh yeah like the past three days i haven't been able to go to work okay all right can i ask a couple of questions do you smoke at all do you drink much in the way of alcohol a pint a week once a week a couple of pints a week a couple of pints a week okay so very minimal alcohol there um but have you tried anything for your symptoms have you tried anything over the counter any creams yeah i've tried a e45 any luck with that yeah no okay all right um and and test the mint and i think okay all right mrs parkinson so i think based on your story i think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis which is very common in particularly people in your in your in your field who are using cleaning products not using gloves you can sometimes get a bit of a reaction between the chemicals and your skin um so moving forward there's a couple of options so firstly what we try and do is you know avoid the triggers in your case i strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times in terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin we can try some steroid creams to help with the inflammation as well as some stronger emollients which you really need to kind of coat on throughout the day three four times a day for the next couple of weeks just to help with the moisturizing of your skin if it still hasn't got better in about a week to two weeks time i really need you to come back and see me again and we can maybe think about other things we can give to you is that all clear yeah that sounds good great do you have any questions for me where do i get the medicines from so i'll i'll do a subscription for you now and send it over to your pharmacy okay great yeah so you said a couple of weeks it should get better i think i think a minimum of a couple of weeks 10 days to 14 days um and if it still hasn't got better or indeed if it's getting worse so if it's spreading or dryness is getting worse come back and see me sooner okay great thank you laura thank you thank you very much bye bye now
