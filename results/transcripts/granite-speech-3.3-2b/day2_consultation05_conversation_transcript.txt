cb2 that's great thank you so much for that are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment yeah okay so how can i help you today you've been having some problems with your asthma is that right sorry sorry that's how can i help you today so um i've been experiencing very weird symptoms over the past month or so and i just wanted to cause them i have googled it the needles right and so what so just so again the connection's not so great you've been getting pins and needles in the hand is that right yeah that's correct okay is that the right or left hand my right hand is it always the right yes okay um we've lost video now maybe is there a button you can press okay are you happy for us to carry on without the video i can't see you at the moment yes that's fine all right um so you've been having these pins and needles episodes of numbness in the right hand is it just the hand or does it go up the arm as well the pins and needles are in the hand but i feel like my arm is getting weaker but it only lasts a few days and then goes back to normal so it's very weird right okay is there any involvement of your leg at all my colleague said i'm walking slightly differently to normal and again it's only for three days or three or four days okay you said you've been having weird symptoms for about a month yeah so what has been happening from the beginning of the month what else has been happening i generally feel tired and weak and sometimes i feel nauseous and i don't feel like i want to do anything right okay um and um you know your colleague said you've you've not been walking normally yes do you feel anything different on either side in terms of your legs have you noticed anything different yeah so at the same time i get my arm symptoms my leg feels weaker right okay and you know you the abnormal gait has that been present outside of these episodes no it has not so normally i'm fitting well actually all right okay um and these these episodes how often have they been happening they've been getting more regular so at the start it would be maybe once a week to every once a once a month but now it's getting a couple of times a day right okay and how long have these episodes been going on for when when did it all start is it maybe a month and a half maybe two months right okay okay and along with these symptoms of the weakness and numbness do you have any other symptoms at the same time like swallowing or difficulty speaking or vision problems so recently i've noticed i can't hold my cup of coffee and when i do drink coffee it's slightly harder to drink and that's only been in the last couple of days i guess right is that during these episodes or outside of these episodes only during the episodes okay do you have any difficulty swallowing this all not currently no during the episodes do you have any difficulty swallowing i i feel like there's something in my throat okay what about um difficulty speaking during these episodes any any issues with that at all no i can speak fine okay and any visual problems during these episodes i don't think so but i wear glasses okay all right now um can i just ask has is there any history of stroke or mini strokes in your family yes my father has had a operation to the side of his neck to reduce the risk of stroke right okay um and uh how about yourself have you had any history of mini strokes or anything like that along those lines i know you're quite young no so after my dad had his operation i was required to be checked and my cholesterol was fine good excellent so you had a blood test done and they did a diabetes as well they checked my diabetes my blood pressure and my cholesterol and the doctor said it was all okay fantastic okay do you have any other illnesses at all no no are you on any medication i take an aspirin 75 milligrams once a day but that's because of something i read on the internet okay so so why is that why do you take that i think it's meant to reduce your risk of stroke and heart attack okay have you ever told a doctor before your gp that you're on aspirin yes i took i started taking it after my father had his operation but that wasn't the doctor telling me okay and has any gp ever spoken to you about the risks of aspirin and whether you should be on it or have you not told the gp in the past no i haven't okay um all right um now um in terms of your uh your kind of social situation um are you working at the moment yes i am what do you work as i'm actually a doctor you're a medical doctor yes okay uh which specialty are you in i work in plastic surgery plastic surgery okay great and um do you have any allergies to any medication at all i'm allergic to penicillin only okay and um are you um living alone no i live with my wife okay um fantastic do you smoke at all no i don't right okay um that's fine now obviously you're a medic yourself did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on i've absolutely got no idea okay well the way you're describing these episodes they make me concerned about mini strokes or tias transient ischaemic attacks and so that's something quite urgent and given that you've got a family history of stroke even though you're quite young i think it's something that we need to exclude what i'm probably going to do in fact what i'm going to do is i'm going to refer you to a stroke pia clinic now just to double check do you have the symptoms right now no i'm perfectly fine at the moment okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to refer you to a mini stroke clinic or a pia clinic i send that referred off now and then you can attend them they'll usually call you in within the next one to two days okay because it's something relatively urgent now today it's wednesday so we've got a few days before the weekend so um basically the deadline should be thursday friday we're expecting to be seen by that time that's the kind of turnaround we're looking at and in that clinic they'll be doing a number of things they'll be checking they'll be checking they'll be doing the ultrasound of the corroded arteries like your father had and they'll be doing maybe they might do a scan of the brain as well to check if there's any signs of a bleed there but they'll be doing a range of tests in a short time frame in order to exclude whether you have any illness or you have got any kind of stroke or mini stroke now if your symptoms return and they persist they're prolonged then you may need to attend a and e okay because our presumptive working diagnosis is mini stroke or tia okay and if a mini stroke is prolonged then then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke and in that case that becomes even more of an emergency so we're not talking about waiting one or two days we want you to go to hospital in that instance as soon as possible okay sure now if things happen again feel free to contact us okay sure now if things happen again feel free to contact us we can assess you over the phone we can give you direction and guidance over the phone that's that's that's not a problem you know we've got you've got easy access to us okay so um this is the plan going forward um i'm going to um do that referral you should hear back from the hospital relatively soon the hospital you can actually ring them on um uh the pal's number and then there's the pal's number and then there's also the dai clinic number i'm going to note that number in the notes for this consultation okay so you'll have all the information you need to chase this appointment and if you want you can ring them either today or tomorrow morning today in the afternoon you wait one or two hours or tomorrow morning just to find out what time they're planning to slot you in and just to make sure they've got you in the system that they've got the books and they're going to be calling you in okay so this isn't an immediate emergency that you need to rush down to an immediate emergency that you need to rush down to any but it's something quite urgent that we need to deal with in a short space of time okay so if there's if there's any delay that transpires for example you can't make the appointment or you know that you don't get called something needs to be getting in contact back with us okay great all right did you have any questions at all no i think that covers most of it okay great so just bear with me a few minutes and then i'll send that all through and then you should you should be able to have the information at your hands in order to get things sorted out okay great thank you all the best take care bye bye
