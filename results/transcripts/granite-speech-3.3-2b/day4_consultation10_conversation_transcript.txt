hello hello hi how are you good thank you how are you fine thanks yeah i'm jo i'm one of the doctors at babylon can i just confirm your name please um my name's lizzie irvine um 23rd of july 1995 great thank you lizzie and are you in a confidential and comfortable space to talk yeah especially on a friday great how can i help yeah just for the last couple of days i've been feeling really sick in my lower tummy and i've had a bit of an ache okay so if um feeling hot sweaty unwell for three days uh feeling sick nausea um with an ache in your low tummy any actual vomiting um so yeah no just nauseous no vomiting yeah luckily and it's only been for a couple of days but yeah two days yeah okay um and uh any problems with your waterworks or diarrhea no so i'm i don't know i'm going to the loo a little bit more often than usual um drink i drink lots of water but it does feel like more often um yeah like nothing nothing too out of the ordinary um and uh i don't know constipated i guess um about a week ago but i'm okay now okay so you've been constipated a week ago uh things uh you're having regular bowel motions now you said you had a bit of diarrhea a bit of watery did you say no it was more like i was just a little bit bummed up and then about a about a week ago that kind of cleared and i'm normal now okay and you're saying you're going you're drinking lots of water you're going to toilet more frequently for a wee yes yeah i'd say so i i tend to drink a lot of water anyway but i feel like i'm going to the toilet more any pain no stinging uh no just it seems normal yeah okay and um and sort of no foul smelling urine or anything like that um no nothing nothing i can think of no are you having you say you're going a bit more frequently are you having to go with urgency to the toilet are we no there's no urgency um yeah no pain or urgency just yeah being quite frequently but it's all seeming normal yeah i probably wouldn't have thought of it being linked but yeah okay all right so um so the main symptom is feeling sick uh with this and you've been feeling bung up and this sort of pain in your tummy just to ask a few more questions about the pain in your tummy is it how would you describe the pain um it's yeah it's like below my belly button um it's it's aching um it does make me feel nauseous um yeah so it's kind of more like a i guess like in a a dull ache um just below the belly button kind of yeah here um and it's it is it constant or is it coming again um it's yeah it's feeling pretty constant over the last couple of days um and just need to ask a few questions about your periods stuff any chance you could be pregnant at the moment um i don't know um probably not i don't think so i'm very sexually active at the moment yes yeah and um you mentioned about periods i did notice a bit of um i don't know it's like not necessarily like spotting but like in my my p is like a little i suppose i think i thought it was my period it's like a little bit pink in your p did you say you so your p is slightly red i want to say slightly pink yeah but i am kind of like jew on my i don't know if that was like yeah a part of it okay so when was your last menstrual period um around a month ago yeah three and a three and a bit weeks ago okay um so and uh did you say you're sexually active are you using contraception i've got the arm the implant and one sexual partner a regular regular boyfriend yeah so just to go back to your symptom of constipation can i just clarify when was the last time you had a bowel motion yesterday okay and do you are still quite bung up at the moment no it seems to have cleared up so i was about a week ago but i'm okay okay now the last few days yeah it's been okay okay all right so you just to sort of confirm your symptoms um you're feeling sort of sick nauseous with tummy pain which is fairly constant um how did the tummy pain come on suddenly or gradually um it's only been for the last two days um so i guess yeah quite recently so it's come on gradually is it yeah not sudden onset okay and uh your last menstrual period was just three and a half weeks ago um and but you say you've had some a little bit of spotting possibly before um in between periods or recently yeah the last kind of week or so yeah the last couple of days really but because i was due on yeah i think yeah just the last couple of days okay but you're expecting your period soon yes yeah sure um okay and just to i'll ask a few questions do you uh do you have any other medical uh problems um that i need to be aware of i'm an allergic to amoxicillin um but no other medical problems that you no not that i'm aware of any drug allergies either you mentioned the mocilin but anything else no that's there and do you take any medications at the moment um no no medications but i'm on the implants i think it's called um implanton implanton yeah surely okay and uh do you live with alone with your partner with my boyfriend and um any other medical uh sorry any uh diseases running your running your family um sweaty feeling i'm not really sure i yeah why it's happening um yeah the last couple of days that's probably all that's yeah that's getting comfortable yeah anything that you'd hoped particularly to get out of having this consultation anything i'm sorry was there anything that you'd hoped to get out of having this specific consultation other than a diagnosis and getting better and you know being on the right track to feeling better yeah no that's kind of i just want to get back to normal yes but a bit more quickly yeah sure sure okay um so and then finally i didn't ask you do you have any discharge or anything like that from down below um no no no discharge no discharge okay all right so um i i think uh this could be a few different things it could just be simple constipation uh you mentioned that you were bung up but you did go yesterday so it's um and your your bowel habits are you've been going regularly uh but you did mention that you were bung up um but there could be a few other things going on i would we'd quite like to see you to do some further to do an examination and to do some some tests as well um we need to definitely rule out pregnancy with you and possibly um do some other examinations or or sort of further tests so would you be happy to actually see a gp face to face um soon today i did yes yeah i can make time are you and you're feeling hot hot and sweaty have you been feeling um light-headed at all or like you're going to faint no no not like i'm going to faint okay all right well we're just sort of tying up running out of time a little bit but um i'd really like to see you for some more examination and and me or agp seeing you you feel worse in any way you get lightheaded you have you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you then i think take them quite seriously and and see somebody more urgently if possible okay is that was there anything else that you want to talk about right now i'm glad we've got the ball rolling with this and we can sort of see you again to take this a little bit further okay yeah thank you really appreciate that okay all right thanks for your time
