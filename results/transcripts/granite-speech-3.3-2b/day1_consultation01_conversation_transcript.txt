close to the toilet and um yeah it's been affecting my day to day activities sorry to sorry to hear that um and when you say diarrhea what do you mean by diarrhea do you mean you're going to the toilet more often or are your stools more loose yeah so it's like loose and watery stool going to the toilet quite often um and like some pain in my like lower stomach okay and how many times a day are you going let's say over the last couple of days probably like six seven times a day six seven times a a day six seven times a day and you mentioned it's mainly watery have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools no no blood yeah just watery and loose stool okay and you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well yep whereabouts is the pain is that in my lower abdomen so uh like um yeah just to one side one side what side is that uh on the left side no sorry okay and can you describe the pain to me yeah it feels um like a cramp uh like a muscular cramp and um yeah i feel a bit weak and shaky okay and does it pain is that is it there all the time or does it come and go uh it comes and goes does the pain move anywhere else for example towards your back um no just mainly in my stomach okay fine and you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky and you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well what do you mean by shaky do you mean you've been having have you been feeling feverish for example um yeah it doesn't feel like yeah just making me feel weak i haven't had a fever um at the moment but i did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started so um yeah around about three or four days ago do you measure your temperature then yeah i i didn't measure my temperature no but i felt um just a bit hot okay okay and yeah there's symptoms like sweating or um like no no and any vomiting at all yeah so um i vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um i've stopped vomiting you stopped vomiting okay and was it vomiting i know it's not nice to talk about but was it just normal food color yeah yeah just normal vomit yeah just normal vomit yeah and there was no blood in your vomit is that right no no okay um and um any other symptoms at all so you mentioned the tummy pain you mentioned diarrhea you mentioned the vomiting anything else that comes to mind um i had a loss of appetite um so i haven't been eating as much um but i've been able to hold down fluids okay so you're drinking fluids yeah what kind of foods have you managed to eat anything um just soups and uh yeah light foods like smoothies and yeah liquid foods mainly okay fine um and so you started just three days ago your symptoms are you aware of any triggers which may have caused your symptoms to kick on so for example things like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people who would similar symptoms yeah so i had takeaway about four days ago um uh but other than that i've yeah been uh eating normally i think unusual yeah do you remember what you ate um yeah i ate at a chinese restaurant with friends okay anyone else in the family side a wife and two kids and one um child was vomiting but they haven't got diarrhea there's no one with the same symptoms okay okay fine um right and uh in terms of your your overall health are you normally feeling well or um yeah i mean other than um asthma um i use an inhaler everything uh else is fine okay and is your asthma well controlled yeah that's fine i just yeah you're saying inhaler and that's under control fine and you don't have any other tummy problems bowel problems i should be aware of no no okay um apart from the inhalers do you take any other medications uh no other medications okay fine and in terms of just your your day to day life you said it's been affecting your life um yeah your life um yeah in what way has it been affecting your life uh so i need to stay close to the toilet because i go quite frequently during the these past three days um yeah other than that it's uh yeah the main concern and have you are you currently working at the moment uh yes yeah i i work um i'm in accounting okay have you been going to work the last three days or have you been at home uh yeah i've days i've been at home uh yeah i've been going to work all good that must be difficult for you then yeah it's been quite difficult right and you say you live with a wife and two children is that right yes yeah all right um just a couple of other questions we need to ask um do you smoke at all uh no i don't smoke and do you drink much in the way of alcohol uh no i i don't drink alcohol no okay yeah so um uh normally at this stage i'd like to examine you if that's okay but um but but having listened to your story i think you just recap for the last three days you've been having loose stool diarrhea a bit of tummy pain mainly on the left hand side um and vomiting and feeling quite weak and lethargic um you mentioned you were having this chinese takeaway as well three days ago and i wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems okay um it seems like you may have something called gastritis which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your tummy mainly caused by viruses but it can be a possibility of bacteria causing your symptoms at this stage what we recommend is just what we say conservative management so i don't think you need anything feel like antibiotics is really just um making sure you're well hydrated so drinking your fluids um there are things like diorite you can get from the pharmacy which it's um it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins okay um and if you are having vomiting and diarrhea i would say recommend that in the first you know first couple of days yeah um if you are feeling feverish and weak you know taking some paracetamol uh that's a few tablets up to week taking some paracetamol uh a few tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help i would certainly advise you to take some time off work actually i know you're quite keen to work um i would say next to two to three days um as the infection clears from your system just take some time off and rest um you know if your symptoms haven't got better you know in in three to four days i'd like you to come back and see me again okay because if it is ongoing then we because if it is ongoing then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing symptoms yeah and we may need to do further tests like taking a sample of your stool so we can test that um etc etc yep sure yeah how's that sound that sounds great yeah yeah do you have any questions for me um no no further questions okay is is the treatment plan clear uh yeah yeah that's that's very clear thank you great well i wish you all the best okay thank you thank you bye
