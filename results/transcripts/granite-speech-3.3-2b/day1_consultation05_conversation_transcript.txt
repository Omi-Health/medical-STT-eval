hello hi good morning kim um how can i help you this morning um so i'm having some some pain in my tummy like the lower part of my tummy okay um and i'm just feeling quite hot and sweaty right i'm sorry to hear that that's when when did your symptoms all start about two days ago okay and whereabouts in your tummy is the pain exactly uh like below my valley button which i quite saw when i pressed on it okay did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual so it hasn't been it's more gradual and it's just it's getting a bit worse now okay okay and can you describe the pain to me it's kind of like a i guess a burning pain and it's just right there in that spot like that's mostly where i'm feeling it it hasn't spread anywhere else just in just below your belly button you weren't mentioned yeah okay um and is the pain constant or does it come and go it's getting constant it's like getting worse um it's not like i i can still move and walk around uh i mean i'm still kind of functioning it's just uh i'm aware of it all time mm-hmm okay um and with the pain have you noticed any other symptoms at all so for example let's let's focus first on your bowels are your bowels working okay yeah i had a bit of constipation but that's better now that was like since last week okay so you've got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose stools no i'm my bowel movements are normal now okay and what about your water works are you passing urine okay yeah i that's fine that i did notice that i was a little the urine was a little pink in color but i haven't like it hasn't really been burning specifically or hurting when i pee and uh and i did notice i was going to the i was peeing more regularly but i have been drinking lots of fluids so i wasn't sure um i wasn't sure um like you know if that was related to the pain can you mention pink urine do you was there any blood at all in urine or is it difficult to see i can't say i mean maybe okay all right but otherwise it doesn't hurt or sting when you pierce your ear and i haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that just that i'm seeing more than i used to regularly okay and moving up towards other symptoms have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all just a little nauseous um but no vomiting no vomiting any temperatures of fevers i haven't i felt a bit hot and sweaty but i haven't really measured it so i can't really say um i and came to have to ask um uh you know or or female patients it's just questions about your cycles if you don't mind me asking um are you currently um are you currently sexually active uh yeah i i've had the same partner i um we were last sexual acts about four days ago um my last sdd screen was normal which was about six months ago okay so you've had no other partners since then no other partners since then okay um uh and do you use any contraception at all um on the implanton i had the implanton inserted about a year ago implanton okay fine um are you still having periods yes when was your last period so we just used the i just have the implant on in the same partner um theoretically if the implant on hasn't been working then i could be pregnant but i don't suspect okay well so far i've been thinking about um maybe we'll do a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that um okay and and so just to summarize so far if you don't mind it's really for the last couple of days this tummy pain has really affected you mainly lower down towards your belly button and it's quite burning you say it's getting worse you noticed some pink urine but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine your bowels are working okay you felt a little bit nauseous and feeling hot and sweaty have i got that all right yeah that sounds very accurate is there anything else perhaps that you feel like you should share with me at this stage which you think might be important i don't think so i think we've covered everything that's really bothering me yeah okay um tell me tell me a bit more about your medical history otherwise are you normally fit and well yeah quite well i haven't had any surgical i don't have any surgical history i don't have any previous i haven't had any operations before or and i'm not on any other medication i just had the implant okay um have you had anything like this before in the past any similar symptoms i've never had i've never had these symptoms before no okay um fine um and you know family history i should be aware of anything relevant family uh related to bowels maybe related to gyno history no not that not that i'm aware of that okay all right um and so you just tell me a bit more about your situation who's at home with you i live in a share house with two other roommates okay and are you currently working yeah i currently work what do you do for work i am an accountant okay grace okay do you smoke at all kim no and do you drink much in the way of alcohol socially i drink but i don't think more than normal okay just before i go into examination i just want to go through just a few screening questions that's okay yes or no we've covered the majority of them already but just want to make sure i'm not missing anything else how's your how's your chest how's your breathing i just feel short of breath or i'm not having any problems or i don't have a cough or anything that's worring me okay any funny heartbeats or rhythms palpitations nothing no okay any headaches any problems with your vision no no okay all right um fine okay um so really just um moving on um so based based on your story really uh kim it's it's a it's a difficult one it's it's it's um we know you've got some pain in your lower abdomen we don't exactly know what's causing it it could be a you know it could be a urine infection for example could it be a you could this be a you know it could be a urine infection for example could this be something related to your gut um could this be something related to your you know a pregnancy related cause um and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out um what's going on here um which i can organize for you today okay um and the based on those tests we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed but certainly if if it's been going on for the last couple of days um you know it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for maybe a urinary infection um so it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for maybe a urinary infection um can we do that instead of me going for tests and then seeing how that goes yeah absolutely so um i think it's certainly worth you know covering worth you know covering you with some antibiotics today but i still want you to bear in mind you know having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here and and i want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time if your symptoms are not getting any better or indeed if they're getting worse so things to look out for would be you know worsening tummy pain um if you're feeling really hot and sweating and temperature's not coming down um vomiting etc does that make sense yeah i think i'm happy with that plan okay um you can try just regular painkillers paracetamol will be advisable um make sure you drink plenty of fluids you can try some cranberry juice as well which can sometimes help with your urine symptoms um take the antibiotics and give me a call if you know if you are worried about anything else uh sure that sounds great thank you very much um should i just collect the script at my pharmacy yeah boston's a stretch to your pharmacy study the antibiotics today something called trimethoprim um we'll take two tablets uh won't take it twice a day for three days okay let's see how you get on okay thank you very much great all the best bye bye
