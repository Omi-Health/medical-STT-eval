been a few days now i have like a sore and a red skin it's kind of it's really itchy and it's like super annoying so i'd like to find something quick to solve it no no problems i'm happy to help um whereabouts on your skin is it affected uh mostly like my chest my my hands my arms like like really it's it's super annoying like it's itching a lot like all the time and i can't even sleep at night like i really need something quickly to to solve it because even at work i like um when i'm in a meeting and i have to like uh think about but my work and focus like actually focus on my work it's really annoying because i can't actually think about what i have to say i'm always like disturbed by this disease no no okay i understand this is obviously affecting you and we'll try very best to get us sorted out for you have you had anything like this before in the past um so yes uh earlier i was like prescribed for my eczema and they gave me like some cream and something to uh when i like was showered uh when i was in the shower i had to put something okay but um did it help and i mean at that time yes but the symptoms like these symptoms are like when these symptoms appeared again i tried those and it didn't work i've tried a few things like i bought like steroid stirred cream at the pharmacy last night but it apparently didn't help because it's still itching a lot today okay yeah do you remember the name of the cream you bought steroid cream okay steroid okay that's okay um do you would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different um it's much more like itchy and my eczema was more like only in the arms um and now it's also on the chest and in the and the on the hands as well like yeah when like i like for instance hiking during the weekends and i i can't really do it anymore because it's like very like like i went to the that last weekend and twas super painful and i have to take like showers every day to be able to kind of ease this itching parts which which is very very annoying no well okay that's okay so you mentioned the itchiness um you also mentioned it's been quite sore um have you noticed any bleeding or discharge from your skin no um so my skin is a bit cracked in some parts like kind of cracked if you see what i mean okay but yeah i haven't noticed any other uh puss or blood coming out of your coming out of your skin and you mentioned it all started three days ago are you aware of any triggers so anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start so for example have you changed your shower gel any clothing have you been around anyone oh it's actually it's very annoying because i'm thinking about maybe i about maybe i should change something because i haven't and i don't understand and i'm kind of afraid of asking people around me because it's kind of you know i don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions it's kind of intimate and so i'll just you know your hair now no no okay that's okay um fine so just to re- summarize for the last four days you've had very itchy skin very sore skin all over your chest and did you also mention your arms and legs as well and no just the chest hands and like like inside the elbows okay and anything on your face at all in my what oh your face oh in my best no okay and apart from this any other symptoms have you noticed for example have you noticed any temperature or fevers no no just your chest itching nothing else okay so your bowels are working okay your chest is okay no cough no breathing difficulties no you're passing urine okay i think so okay all right um it's always good to know so i mean do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms anyones anyone any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms and i um so i had exam before so maybe it's this but it seems like more like my exam was only on the arm so i'm not sure i really have no idea okay that's okay so um normally at this stage i'd like to examine you um to see the rash itself and see exactly what type of rash it is but from what you've told me you mentioned it's you've got some dry skin and some cracked skin as well and it's been very itchy and so with your um uh your background of eczema um sorry to say it's a couple of questions i wanted to ask you which i completely forgot my apologies apart from the eczema do you have any other medical problems i should be aware of uh no i just had asthma in the past but okay not anymore okay and do you take any regular medications at the moment uh no no okay do you have any allergies to anything like something sorry yeah sorry i was going to german allergies things hello hello yes oh can you hear me oh sorry i think it cracked um do you have any allergies at all oh allergies no no okay um and tell me about your um your situation at home who do you live with um so i live with a few flatmates i'm uh so you know i'm 31 uh i yeah i'm i have a full-time job and so i'm living with a few people to save money okay and what do you do for work uh i work at a pharmaceutical company so it's been uh it's been a few years now uh it's uh it's kind of interesting we're working i'm a like a kind of project manager uh i mean do you want to to know more about it okay uh no no that's not actually that's absolutely fine um just a couple of questions i wanted to ask you which can sometimes affect your symptoms is do you smoke at all no no and do you drink much in the way of alcohol uh you know once in a while i can i like hanging out with people once in a while so yeah say a few a few beers per week something like this nothing nothing crazy i used to drink a lot more when i was younger but it's been it's been a while okay i've got to say at this stage i've got to say that the sound quality is not great but i'll continue because we've come this far so based on everything you mentioned sir i will continue because we've come this far um so um based on everything you mentioned sir i i do wonder whether this is a flare up of your eczema um the reason being that you said it's quite itchy um it's manifecting your chest and your back um and uh the having looked at your skin uh the the rash does appear quite familiar um you mentioned using steroid creams yesterday um today from the pharmacy i wonder whether giving you stronger prescription of a steroid may be beneficial which i'm happy to prescribe to you today as well as i'm going to give you some some emollients which helps moisturize the skin which i also use in the bath and shower and it's definitely worth using that for the first seven to ten days before we make a decision on whether it's working or not it's also worth using antihistamines which you can sometimes buy over the counter things like loratadine or piratin which can help with the itchiness of your skin and it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap because if if that's causing you symptoms then we need to have a discussion about that next time i see you okay just i have tried antihistamines lately but it didn't really help oh could you say again sorry i have tried the antihistamines okay so something for you to think about you can get different type of antihistamines i can give you something a little bit stronger today as well something like fexofenadine which i which i can give to you today it's definitely worth trying it's not going to do you any harm but as anything using the steroids and the emollients on a regular basis over the next week to 10 days should hopefully control your symptoms but do come back and see me next week if things don't get better that sounds good okay do you have any questions for me no that's it okay well i wish you all the best thank you very much thank you have a good day bye thank you doctor bye
