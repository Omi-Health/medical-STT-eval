hello hi i'm dr jacob and welcome to babylon hi so just before we start is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please yeah uh john dale okay and your date of birth um i had 21 12 and 19 uh 86 and your address for me please it is uh number one london street um nw3 6pq that's correct and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation we are yes okay so i understand you're having a headache is that correct uh yeah i've had a um a sort of a very sort of bad severe headache for the past four days um and i'm i've been sort of feeling a bit hot as well um i've got got a bit of a temperature i think i haven't measured it but um i think i here i think i've got fever okay right and um so what started first was it the headache or the fever um so um headache started first um and then sort of yeah fever sort of came along a bit afterwards okay afterwards right and what have you taken so far for your headache um so i've had some paracetamol and some ibuprofen but it's not really helping at the moment okay so just a few more questions with regards to your headache so do you find it difficult to look at the light um no my my like um it's fine light doesn't seem to i like um it's fine light doesn't seem to bother me too much okay and is there any pain when you try to move your neck from side to side look up and down is there any pain and i've got sort of general aching muscles um not necessarily sort of in my neck it's kind of a bit all over really okay all over right and have you been sick with this headache no i haven't i haven't been sick okay and do you have a cough uh no no cough okay so there's no cough for cold yeah uh no okay and you your ears are okay there's no ear aches um no it seems to be okay that's fine okay all right and with this headache have you experienced any pins and needles in your face arms and legs no no no can't say any muscle weaknesses at all um just i suppose general aching body aching not not many weaknesses but there you couldn't you know hold a cup or anything like that that's what i mean uh no um and so yeah and seems to be fine with that sort of stuff but yeah okay and um just a few more questions do you because i don't have any of your background history do you suffer from any medical conditions no general medical history is fine and no surgical history that no medical or surgical complaints yeah no and i suppose i have been away to thailand a sort of week or so i go um i've had some like usual mosquito bites from sort of traveling around and a a friend of mine has also been a bit unwell but um uh yeah that's the only sort of like history per se right and um do you have any kind of shivering at all do you're shivering with the fever um i um uh i do feel cold quite a lot um you know it's um i'm no i'm not shivering but definitely like a bit cold hot and cold yeah yeah okay right and are you using you've mentioned about the paracetamol i'm grinding now but are you on any regular any medication anything that you're using at and all right okay and okay so i believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you yeah it's not possible for us to do that online i think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination and i think you would need one quite urgently okay so the things that's running in the back of my mind are kind of a viral illnesses that can one can get with sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel like marium the other common thing around thailand it will be like some dengue but that would have like you would have some blood spots or bleeding or something which you don't have at the moment do you no no i mean i've got a bit of a rash but nothing like uh no no no bleeding okay so where's the rash um it's uh rashes kind of all over my body like how would this describe the rash um uh sort of red and itchy red and itchy okay so if you were to put a glass on top of the rash does that rash go away yes it goes away okay okay so what we need to do is we need to urgently examine you and that sometime today okay and um after our examination there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital but i'm not sure as yet so i'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible okay um i'll write notes in and recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor preferably in the next few hours time okay and um in any case is if that's not available i'd like you to take your stuff to a&e okay all right any questions at all uh no i'm serious you know obviously when i've spoken to you you you didn't take the box for many series but you're in the middle somewhere let's put it that way okay um if if you you know things like we have to rule out is meningitis and all but then you just have a general you just have a general muscle ache you didn't say that you had things like you had problems looking at light or something so those are things when we think of meningitis but and then it's the uh in meningitis you get a non-blanching rash rash while in any kind of virus you know the rash usually goes away saying that we don't know whether these are the beginning stages so that's why i'd rather but i would rather you see a gp the ucegp as soon as possible if we've got a slot available but if not i think you need to be seen and maybe have some blood tests and examinations okay again go thank you very much all right you take care then bye now cheers bye
