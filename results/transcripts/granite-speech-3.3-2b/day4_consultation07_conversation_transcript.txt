work for about three or four those days because of a bad it okay i'm sorry to hear that so you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week and what came what came first are the sore throats came first and then after that or two the cough okay okay and uh are you coughing up anything no it's very dry okay so i'm just going to ask a few questions about the uh your current symptoms and then i'm just going to ask a few questions about the your current symptoms and then a little bit about your background and something else about what we can do a little bit later on in the consultation to help you but before i go on anything you're particularly concerned about or have any ideas what might be going on you said that you had a cold well i mean you know you know how we all are once this happens you google it and it seems to be all kinds of bad things it could be all kinds of bad things it could be it could be it could be a cold or flu obviously it could be tuberculosis it could be cancer always comes up so it would be good if none of those wait so yeah can provide a little bit of reassurance and we can talk about those a little bit as well and was there anything you were particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation um well yeah so reassurance so hopefully some sense that it's not anything too serious but also if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it and some reassurance um i'll give you about your concerns so um you mentioned that you started with a sore throat about a week ago developed into a bit of a dry cough and i'll just ask a few questions around those so um do you have any shortness of breath yes yes i'm being having shortness of breath yeah i've been having shortness of breath yeah you are short of breath and uh do you have any wheeze or chest pain oh yeah a bit of both that's it you're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well yes okay and how when did you start to develop the shortness of breath i see so so the shortness of breath was about last week friday or thursday call for saturday or sunday so the cough for saturated so the shortness of breath was i think shortly after the cough so maybe a day or two later so three four days ago three or four days ago you started developing so and is the cough worse at night time no it's the same throughout the day and uh when you say you're short of breath just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are you able to to get um so like walk up a flight of stairs for example um or or are you short breath of rest oh yeah it's like when i'm doing walking um and i do exercise now and then so it hasn't been super bad like hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things but it's been pretty unusual and i'm a little bit worried and you're a bit concerned about that okay so i just need to ask a few uh things about your background as well so um do ask a few things about your background as well so do you have any other medical conditions or medical history no just no no past medical history no past medical history no history of asthma and any history of clot on your legs or your lungs so visibilities of peas none uh no no in your family has had those clots in the legs or the lungs well my mother had lung cancer your mother had lung cancer do you smoke not have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos you know don't know if asbestos ever smoked i mean once or twice in amsterdam i think that's but not really okay um and uh this they just going back to the your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough it's a dry cough no you're not coughing up any phlegm um do you do you have uh and you say you don't have any chest pain as such um uh are you taking any medications currently no no i'm not okay are you allergic to any medications not to any medication are you allergic to peanuts peanuts okay um and uh you mentioned and you say you have a cold so do you have sinus congestion or um no it seems to be all sinusitis with just my throat like my nose is it's really not like just your just your throat and any recent travel or have you always lived in the uk uh no so i i i haven't always lived in the uk like so i was born in the us and moved over about 12 years ago but it's been a recent travel just to europe nowhere too exotic okay so no so no recent travel no significant recent travel anywhere um okay and are you coughing up anything other than um so you're not coughing up blood or anything like that no um good and uh are you feeling feverish irish hot cold sweaty yeah so a little bit feverish um at first so the first three or so days of this but then it the fever's gone away okay and in general do you feel the fever's gone away okay and in general do you say you're feeling you're you're beginning to to feel better worse or or and i just need to ask any other sort of risk factors um that you may have so um no sort of significant weight loss um or unexplained weight loss any losses so no weight loss but i have been have been losing my appetite recently and i mean i usually eat a lot so i enjoy eating as well but like well that's that's been a bit concerning you've been losing your appetite recently yes and you're a little bit concerned about that but you haven't you haven't lost any weight that you think of no no okay um so i would ask to examine you now but um i i don't know if i could sort of look inside your throat at least to see if there's a probably we can try oh no well no it's okay i might think about doing that have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck that you can feel uh no not the no okay um and so finally you were talking about uh talking about i mean it sounds to me that you've been a little bit up and down sore throat developed a dry cough you are slightly short of breath but not too overly concerningly short of breath what i would say we're just coming to the end of the consultation now is if you feel significantly worse if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness or breathlessness that you are concerned about and i would advise you to seek medical attention again here at gp and actually see somebody physically but i think for now i can sort of try and reassure you that if this clears up as i expect it would so expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days if it's not please get in touch with the medical professional gain and i would expect it to and so therefore i wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis your concerns about lung cancer was that the other thing you were concerned about oh yeah yeah so so again if you're not getting better please see somebody again i've just and we've got a we've got a sick note here okay so um uh and i'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days off work um and paracetamol lots of fluids um and rest up and as i say if you're not feeling better please get in touch okay all right have a good day thank you
