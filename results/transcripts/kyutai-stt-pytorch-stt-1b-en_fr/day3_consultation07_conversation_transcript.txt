That's good. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Yes. Okay. So you mentioned in our notes that you've got skin problem. If you can tell me a bit more about it, please. Yes. Over the past few days, I had noticed my skin is sore and red. Okay. So where is it sore and red? It's all over my chest. My hands and arms. Especially inside of the elbows. And the elbows, on the inside of the elbow. Okay. Inside of the elbows. Yeah. Which is the worst area. All right. The worst area. Is it very itchy? It's very itchy and dry. All over my body. Itchy and dry. Okay. Have you had something like this in the past? Yes. Yes, I have had eczema in the past. Okay. Do you think this is similar to your usual eczema? Is it worse? I think it's, yeah, it's gotten worse. Like these past few days. Yeah. But you would be like something similar. So are your skin, is there any, you know, any of the patches of sore areas? You mentioned it's quite sore. Is it weeping? Is it like watery, liquid coming from that area? Weeping? No. Nothing that you notice. Okay. Right. But some of the areas are cracked. Yeah. So you have cracks over there. Okay. And is there any scratch marks on your, on any of the, you know, areas? Any scratch marks? You mean, it's very itchy. So I scratch myself, but it's not no scratch mark. Okay. Is there any thickened skin? Like, you know, where it's, the skin's very, um, thick and darkened areas? No, no, I don't think, I don't think so. Okay. All right here. So you've mentioned you've got a history of eczema. So what do you do about it? What, how do you keep it under control? Yeah, usually I use a cream called deprovase. The shower I use something called thermal. Thermal. All right. And have you been using them recently or not? Yes. Yes. I use them. Use them every day? Yes. There's no change in that. I didn't change any. Okay. Have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema? Um, I, I, I'm not sure. Uh, yes, yes, uh, yes. You've used But it's not helping. Yeah. Also, you're still using the steroids. Yeah, I tried. I tried. Which one are you using the steroids? What's the name? I'm not sure. It's, uh, is it the box? It's not there. Okay. So is it like the on the counter once? Sorry. Over the counter, hydrocortisone. Does that ring a bell? Yeah. So you're using the hydrocortisone. Yeah. Are you using any antihistamines at all? Uh, no, no, no antihistamines. Okay. Right. Fine. Otherwise, other than those rash, you're feeling well in yourself. There's no temperature, no joint pains. Yeah. No, but I will say I've tried those antihistamines. It didn't work. You've tried the antihistamines and didn't work. Okay. Which one did you try? The one over the counter. Okay. So like citrus in, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right. Okay. So from what you're describing, it looks like, you know, it is quite widespread. Your eczema. Yeah. Because you're having it all over your chest and hands and things like that. So do you have any allergies to any medication at all? No, no allergies. No allergies. Okay. And you don't, other than eczema, you don't have any other medical condition. I have asthma and in my family, there is a hypothyroidism and migraine. My mother has migraine. Mother has migraine. And what was the other one? I didn't understand. Hypotheroid. Who has hypothyroidism? My mother. Okay. So she has hypothyroidism. Okay. That's fine. Right. You mentioned you have asthma. So what medications are you using for asthma? You know, probably Nader. The blue tailor, so you don't use it every day. So you just use it on and off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Blue inhalers. But your breathing is all okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Only, I'm sorry. It's only when I have a flare. Sure. So what we need to do is obviously you've got extent, as I've mentioned, so extensive eczema. What we'll do, you need a couple of things because to keep you a bit comfortable, you would probably need some antihistamines, which I'm going to prescribe. Also, hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you use for young children. You might probably need a bit more stronger one, like Betnawage or something like that. Okay. So we'll try that first. So I'm going to, it's called the antihistamine. It's called Fexpenadine. And then we will try with some Betnawage first. So it's like very small amount. Like it's like one fingertip. Yeah. This much is enough to cover your palms and your back of your hands. Yeah. So it's very small amount. So that if you can imagine, you can couple with the very small amount, the whole body. Yeah. So use that. You have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks. Okay. Okay. If there's no improvement, you need to get back to us. Or if you have any kind of adverse reaction, like an allergic reaction, which is unlikely, but if it's still happens, you need to get in touch with us. Okay. Okay. So what we're going to do is we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy. It looks like boots on the systems. Is that correct? Yeah. Yes. Yes. So I'll send it across to boots. I mean, we'll be there for collecting. If things are getting worse in the next two weeks, call us beforehand. Otherwise wait for two weeks, take the medication and the cream. You still need to continue on your emollients, like the thermal soap and as well as the fibroate. Yeah. So you still need to use those in the interim. Any questions at all? No. No questions. You take care then. Bye bye now. Bye. Bye.
