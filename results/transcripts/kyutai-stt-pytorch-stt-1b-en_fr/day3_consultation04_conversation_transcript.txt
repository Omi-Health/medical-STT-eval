Hi, hello, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Hi, so just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please? Yes, my name is Dr. Jacob. And your date of birth? The 14th of 1996. And your address for me, please? And 28 Quicks Road, SW191EZ. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location, we can have a confidential conversation. Thank you. Okay, so you mentioned in our notes that you've got some tiredness, if you could like to tell me a bit more about it, please. Yeah, so about two to three days ago, I was running with a friend and usually I could talk to her whilst I ran, but I found myself actually short of breath. I'm not really short of breath when I'm walking. I think I'm just using that as and when I have symptoms. Yeah, so at the moment you are having shortness of breath, so are you using it every day at the moment? Yeah, and morning and evening to kind of prevent it as well. What's that, sorry? You do have a history of eczema, you know. My brother's asthmatic and my sister had eczema, and I've got a few issues. No, I don't... I'm not coughing up much beauty. Okay, no, it's beautiful. Right, here. And how are you using your plenil? So, are you using it every day? I think I'm using that every day, and the sound beauty model, just like as and when. So, how are you using the plenil? Is it twice a day? Yes, twice a day. Okay. And have you ever been admitted in hospital because your smell was so bad? No, I haven't. Okay. Right, here. When was the last time you had an asthma attack? About three to four years ago. Three to four years ago. And what did the GP do at that time? encourage me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative. Okay, so you didn't have any steroids or antibiotics? Not that I can remember. Okay. Have you ever had oral steroids in the past? No. When was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse? About two years ago. Okay, two years ago. Okay, but your asthma was pretty under control till now, isn't it? Yes, just in the last few years. So do you do a peak flow meter at home? Peak flow reading where you blow into, you know, do you do that now? Just every now and then I haven't done it over the last, since I've had symptoms. Okay, so what was, what's your peak flow reading when you're good? Like normally, peak flow. Okay, do you have any allergies at all? I have a fever, sorry, could you repeat that please? Sorry, I have hay fever. Okay, okay, now any allergies to medication? No, sorry. Okay, so you're not allergic to anything? So no allergies, okay. Excellent. Right, yeah. So what we need to do that, obviously, you haven't had it as much for some time and it looks like you can be having a small exacerbation. So what I would like you to be seen by one of our GPs in the next few days, in the interim, what I'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when. Okay, and use it maximum about every two to four hours, but you are using it that often, that means pretty much that, you know, your asthma is really bad. You can use it, but that's not ideal. The brown in your clemol, the brown inhaler, you can up the dose, if you're using just two puffs twice a day, you can increase it to four puffs twice a day. Yeah, and while this is to do while you're waiting to see us. Now, mentioned, you know, you're doing what, you know, increase the clemol to four puffs twice a day, and you're using the asthma, you know, the blue inhalers every two to four hours. And you're breathing is getting really worse, then you would need to take yourself to A&E, you shouldn't wait for our appointment. Okay, so when the doctor sees you, what we're going to do is we're going to examine your chest, yeah, make it to the peak that you're reading. So depending on what we find, you might need some antibiotics or some steroids, but anyway, while you're at home, we are going to by increasing your clemol, we are increasing your steroid intake anyway. Okay, so yeah, so any questions you want to ask me? Yeah, so book an appointment, call support, book an appointment to see and I will recommend that you do the face to face. In the interim, increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day, and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly, but if you're breathing, it's getting worse and you've not seen us, you take your breath to A&E. All right, thank you so much for your time. You're welcome. Take care then. Bye bye.
