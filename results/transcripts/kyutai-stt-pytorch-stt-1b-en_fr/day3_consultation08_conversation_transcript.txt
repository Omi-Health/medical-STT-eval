So you're not wheezy or so rattly noises in your chest? No. Okay. Right. So what have you taken so far? So just like painkillers and such. I mean, in addition to like my normal medication and such, but like. So you mentioned, have you come to your normal medications, but you've mentioned you've taken some painkillers, like could you tell me the names, please? I would just like paracetamol. Paracetamol, okay. Any ibuprofen at all? No. No. Okay. And also, you mentioned some regular medication. Unfortunately, I don't have your medical, complete medical history. So if you could tell me what your medications are and what you use them for. Yeah. So I take metformin. I have a diabetic. And also like have lisinopril. Lisinopril, okay. For the blood pressure. Yeah. Okay. And how long have you been a diabetic for? Like a few years, maybe five or six years. Five, six years. Okay. Okay. Do you want to do your blood sugars at all? Yes. Okay. And how have they been doing at the moment? No issues. Nothing like out of the ordinary there. Okay. So there's no problems with your blood pressure control at the moment, even though you're not. Okay. So that's absolutely fine. And when was the last time you took your blood pressure? I've been this morning. This morning. And what was the readings like? I can't remember off the top of my head, but it would have been normal rain. Because there was nothing alarming, yeah? Normal. Okay. Fine. Okay. So that seems all right. Okay. So can I hypothetically look into your mouth? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. So this, yeah, okay. So looking into your mouth, you know, there's just a bit mild redness at the back of your throat. There's no enlarged tonsils. Can you feel any glands around your neck at all? No, I haven't had any like that. Okay. So it looks like it's just a viral infection. Because it's just a cold and a cough. There's nothing there. And generally, if you have things like a chest infection, you would have a bit like a wheeze or shortness of breath. So things that we would recommend is you can use the, you know, night nurse, day nurse. It's still okay with your medications. Yeah. So I'm sure you are a bit wary to use them, but it's still okay with your current medication. You can still use that. Might be able to make you feel a bit more better quickly. If there's any change, like you're feeling short of breath or the, your symptoms are lasting more than three weeks or something, or you're becoming poorly, things like that, then you need to get in touch with us. Then probably we might need to examine you and especially your chest. But I don't think so. That's necessary at this point in time. Okay. That sounds good. Okay. Any questions at all? No, I think that's been very helpful. Thank you. Okay. So just to wrap up, just use the night nurse, day nurse. If any change in your symptoms, like shortness of breath, wheezy, or symptoms are lasting more than three weeks, then get in touch with us. Okay. So I don't need any prescription or anything. You don't need anything at the moment. Okay. Take care then. Thank you very much. All right.
