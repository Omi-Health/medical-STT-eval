Hello. Hello. How are you doing? Good, thank you. How are you? Fine, thanks. Yeah, I'm Joe. I'm one of the doctors at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? My name is Lizzie Irvine. 23rd of July, 1995. Great. Thank you, Lizzie. And are you in a confidential and comfortable space to talk? Yeah, especially on a Friday. Great. How can I help? Yeah, just for the last couple of days, I've been feeling really sick in my lower tummy. And I've had a bit of a temperature, so feeling quite like hot and sweaty. And it's, yeah, okay, I'm really uncomfortable. Okay, so you've been feeling nauseous, and you've had some pain in your lower tummy, or you say you've been feeling sick in your lower tummy? Yeah, it's more of an ache. So like an ache in my lower tummy. I think it's feeling hot and sweaty, sometimes. I think it's sickness, but yeah, a bit of an ache. Okay, so feeling hot, sweaty, unwell for three days, feeling sick, nausea, with an ache in your lower tummy. Any actual vomiting? So yeah, no, No, so I'm, I'm going to the loo a little bit more often than usual. I drink lots of water, but it does feel like more often. Yeah, like nothing, nothing too out of the ordinary. And I was, I was a little bit like, I don't know, constipated, I guess. About a week ago, but I'm okay now. Okay. So you've a bit constipated a week ago, things are you having regular bowel motions now? You said you had a bit of diarrhea or a bit of watery, did you say? No, it was more like I was just a little bit bummed up. And then about a week ago, that kind of cleared and I'm a normal now. Okay. And you're saying you're going, you're drinking lots of water, you're going to the toilet more frequently for a wee? Yes, yeah, I'd say so. I tend to drink a lot of water anyway, but I feel like I'm going to the toilet. Any pain on your past urine? No, no pain. No stinging? No, just seems normal. Yeah. Okay. And sort of no foul smelling urine or anything like that? No, nothing, nothing I can think of, no. Are you having, you're saying you're going a bit more frequently? Are you having to go with urgency to the toilet? No, there's no urgency. Yeah, no pain or urgency. Yeah, it's like below my belly button. It's aching. It does make me feel nauseous. Yeah, so it's kind of more like a, I guess like a dull ache. Just below the belly button, kind of, yeah, here. And is it constant or is it coming and going? It's, yeah, it's feeling pretty constant. And just need to ask a few questions about your periods. Any chance you could be pregnant at the moment? I don't know. Probably not. I don't think so. I'm very careful. Sexually active at the moment? Yes. And you mentioned about periods. I didn't notice a bit of... I don't know. It's like not necessarily like spotting, but like in my pees, like a little, I suppose, I think I thought it was my period. It's like a little bit pink. In your pee, did you say? So your pee is slightly red. But I am kind of like due on my... I didn't know if that was like, yeah, part of it. Okay. So when was your last menstrual period? Around a month ago. Yeah. Three and a bit weeks ago. Okay. So three... And did you say... So you're sexually active. Are you using contraception? I've got the implants. One sexual partner, a regular boyfriend? Yeah. Just to go back to your symptom of constipation, can I just clarify, when was the last time you had a bowel motion? Yesterday. Okay. And do you feel like you... Are still quite bunged up at the moment? No, it seems to have cleared up. So I was about a week ago, but I'm okay. Okay now, the last few days. Yeah, it's been okay. Okay. All right. So just to sort of confirm your symptoms, you're feeling sort of sick, nauseous, with tummy pain, which is fairly constant. Did the tummy pain come on suddenly or gradually? It's only been for the last two days. So I guess, yeah, quite recently. So it's come on gradually. Not sudden onset. Okay. And your last menstrual period was just three and a bit weeks ago. But you say you've had a little bit of spotting possibly before. Do you have any other medical problems? I need to be aware of. I mean, allergic to psillin. Allergic to moxicillin. But no other medical problems. No, not that I'm aware of. Any drug allergies? Oh, you mentioned the moxicillin, but anything else? No, that's it. And do you take any medications at the moment? No medications, but I'm on the implants. I think it's called Implanon. Implanon, yeah, sure. Okay, do you smoke? No. Okay, and do you live alone with your partner? With my boyfriend. With your boyfriend. And any other medical, sorry, any, these is running your family? Not any of this spring to mind in my immediate family. My brother is a type one diabetic. Sure. Great, so is there anything that you're particularly concerned about with this nausea and the constipation? I don't know, it's just a really, like, really horrible ache. And I'm nauseous. Hot, sweaty, feeling. I'm not really sure. Yeah, why it's happening. For the last couple of days, that's probably all that's happening. Comfortable. Yeah, anything that you'd hoped, particularly to get out of having this consultation? Anything sorry? Was there anything that you'd hoped to get out of having this specific consultation other than a diagnosis and getting better and, you know, being on the right track to feeling better? Yeah, no, that's kind of, I just want to, get back to. To normal, yeah. A bit more comfortably. Yeah, sure, sure. Okay, so, and then finally, I didn't ask you, do you have any discharge or anything like that from Damplo? No, no, no discharge. No discharge, okay. All right, so I think, this could be a few different things. It could just be simple constipation. You mentioned that you were bunged up, but you did go yesterday. So it's, and your bowel habits, you've been going regularly. But you did mention that you were bunged up. But there could be a few other things going on. I would quite like to see you to do some further, to do an examination and to do some tests as well. We need to definitely rule out pregnancy with you and possibly do some other examinations or sort of further tests. So would you be happy to actually see a GP face to face soon? Today, I do. Yes, yeah. And you're feeling hot and sweaty. Have you been feeling lightheaded at all or like you're going to faint? No, no, not like I'm going to faint. Okay. All right. Well, we're just sort of tying up, running out of time a little bit. But I'd really like to see you for some more examination and investigations. If in the meantime, between now and me or a GP seeing you, you feel worse in any way, you get lightheaded. You develop any symptoms which are concerning to you. Then I think it's taken quite seriously and see somebody more urgently if possible. Okay. Is that, was there anything else that you want to talk about right now? I'm glad we've got the ball rolling with this. And we can sort of see you again to take this a little bit further. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Really appreciate that. Okay. All right. Thanks for your time. Bye.
