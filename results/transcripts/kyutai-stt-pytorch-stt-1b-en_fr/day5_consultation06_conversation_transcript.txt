Okay um and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off or getting worse or? They're not getting any better because like I said I've been I've been vomiting literally everything I take so so I doubt that even that has had the chance to work. Okay um I mean it sounds like because your brother's had a similar thing it sounds like it might be some an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got which is you usually caused by a virus but it can be from something you've eaten. How do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even like drink or something, not everything? Yeah, so you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago. So you're obviously still hydrated enough to pass urine. But we should see you say that we can check your hydration. And get that sample sent off as soon as possible. Because if you come into the clinic, you can send that sample off straight away. Otherwise, we would have to post it out to you, which would take time. Okay, so when can I come to the clinic to have this? So we can we can make you an urgent appointment. And then you can you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration. But if in the meantime, you're feeling more unwell, then we would get you seen urgently in A&E. Okay, so you could call us back in the meantime. Okay, so what I'll do, yeah, if you could please put me in the appointment and then yeah, I'll see how I feel. For the end of the day, hopefully, I don't need to go to A&E. Yes, please. Right, okay, we'll do that for you. Okay, take care. Thank you. Thanks, bye.
