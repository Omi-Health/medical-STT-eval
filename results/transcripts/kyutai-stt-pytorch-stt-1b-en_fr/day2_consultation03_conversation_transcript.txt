Hello? Hi there, good morning. Hi. I'm Dr. Jim Niggle from Booker, nice to see you. Nice to see you, hello. Before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth, if that's okay? Yes, Mary Richards, and my 40-year-old Yeah, so again, it's the left side, it's kind of like around my left ear, and kind of a long here, so like my jawline, just all feeling a bit numb around here. Right, okay. Has anything else happened? Not that I, I can't notice, I think, occasionally notice like a ring in my ear, you know, part of it, sure, okay, and have you had any weakness or numbness down the, in the rest of the body at all? No, no, no, no, nothing like that. Okay, have you had any difficulty swallowing? No. And have you had any difficulty speaking? No, no. Have you noticed any problems with your vision at all? No, that's all good. Okay, and do you have the numbness present right now? Yeah, kind of, kind of there, quite often, it's like four times, so yeah, right now it feels very, doesn't feel like when I touch this line my second. Sure, sure, okay, all right, just going back to the kind of muff of hearing feeling in the ear, do you have any discharge coming from that ear at all? No, nothing, nothing coming out. Any pain in the ear or from the ear? No, right, okay, and have you had any fever at all? No, nothing like that. And do you, have any itchiness in the ear? No. Do you use copper or buds to kind of pin your ears out? I don't, oh, no, no, no, don't use copper or buds to pin your ears out. Okay, all right, do you need to ask a few other general questions? Do you have any other illnesses at all? I, well, I've got kind of been told I had colic in my nose in the past, and occasionally get some kind of heartburny feeling, that's all fine, and you know, I take a Rennie if I need to, and if my nerve colic is playing up, I've got a spray, other than that, I think they said ages ago I had something called heart, I can't remember, but lab colin cytus, something like that, but again, nothing, nothing on the table. Sure, okay, so are you on any regular medication? You mentioned the spray for your nose. Yeah, so I know, I only take the spray for my nose when I need it for, and sometimes take over like Rennie, but I just get that for the chemist. Sure, and the spray for your nose, where do you get that from? Is that from a doctor? Yeah, they gave me a prescription ages ago. Yeah, do you remember the name of the spray at all? Unfortunately, I don't, sorry. That's all right, that's good. And you're not on any other medication at all? No. No, okay, do you have any allergies to any medication? No, just latex. Latex, okay, all right, let's fix it now. And in terms of your family, are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all? My brother had neurofiber metosis, I think it is. Right, okay. Other than that, everyone else is okay. Okay, good, that's good to hear. And in terms of your own kind of background now, are you working at the moment? Yeah, so I'm a jockey, but because of all the kind of symptoms I've been getting, especially sometimes when I get a ringing, I can feel a bit dizzy, I've just had to do far less training. So kind of beginning to, yeah, impacting work, a little bit now. Okay, so you have to excuse my ignorance. Jockey like with horses, is that what you're talking about? Yeah. All right, okay, okay, fine. Great. And do you live alone? I live with my partner. Okay, right. Do you have any pets at all at home? No, no pets. Okay, fine, fantastic. All right. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what's been going on recently? No, just like I said, like the ringing, occasionally, and when I get that, I can sometimes feel a bit dizzy, but the main thing is really just lack of hearing. Obviously, we're limited in terms of assessment via video portal, but from what you've told me, this doesn't seem to be anything that you're going to die from. However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today, okay? I would like you to come into one of my clinics. I'd like a GP to assess you. What you're describing might be something called bell palsy. We can go into that explaining what that is. If that's confirmed on physical examination. That's not usually a life-threatening problem, but part of the reason why I'd like you to come in is just that we can do what we call a neurological examination just to make sure there's something else going on.
