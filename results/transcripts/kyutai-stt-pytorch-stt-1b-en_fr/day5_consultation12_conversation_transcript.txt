Hi there, it's Dr Smith from Babylon. Thank you. Can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address, please? Yes, I can. It's Mary Smith. I'm 28 and I live at apartment 4059C Carcamall Road. Okay, that's fun. Are you in a private place you can have a consultation today? Yes, I am. What can I do for you? I keep having a headache. Okay, and when did it start? It started yesterday. It's unusual for me to have a headache. Okay, can you just tell me where that's in your head it is? It's on the left side at the back. Okay, just on the left side. Yes. When did it start? What time did you say it started yesterday? About mid-morning. And how did it feel when it first started? Just quite intense and kind of quite throbbing. It kind of built up gradually after a short period of time. Okay, and did you get any other symptoms along with that? Any nausea, vomiting, tingling, numb, weakness anywhere? No, nothing. Okay, and I No, nothing like that. Any heart fever, you feeling shivery, sweaty? No, no fever. Any rashes at all? No. And in the past, have you had any headaches before? Not really. Okay. How bad would you say the headache is from 0 to 10 if 10 is the worst pain that you could have and 0 is nothing? I'd say about 8. Okay. And have you taken any painkillers? I took some Neurofen yesterday. Okay. And did that make any difference? Not really. Okay. And last night, did you manage to sleep through the night okay? Yes, I did. Has it been worse at any particular time of the day? No, it hasn't made any difference at the time of the day. Any difference if you lie down, stand up, bend over, pass or sneeze or anything like that? No. And have you got any other medical problems? No, I haven't. Anything you take medication for? No, I don't. Any over-the-counter medications or allergies? No, only the Neurofen I took yesterday. And any stomach problems or asthma at all? Anyone in your family got any medical problems? My mother's had hypertension and she does get migraines. And have you had your blood pressure checked? No, not recently. And who do you live with at home? Sorry? Who do you live with at home? My partner. And what's your job? I mean, the fact that you haven't had headaches before, is unusual, the fact that they've developed. Is there anything you think has changed, any increased stress, change in your diet or lifestyle? Not that I can think of. Okay, so what we would suggest is trying the slightly stronger pain relief. So similar to ibuprofen, but taking it instead of ibuprofen, not at the same time, and taking that regularly with food. Hopefully that will settle it down. You can take paracetamol along with that. Try and take rest, have lots of good hydration. But if the pain's getting worse, or you get new symptoms, fever, rash, vomiting, neck stiffness, or you keep getting epidose at the same type of thing, then we need to speak to you and make a plan for what we can do next. Okay, thank you. Any other questions? How long do you think it will last for? Well, I should think it should simple down. If it's getting worse or not settling in the next day or two, then certainly give us a call back when you tried the medication that I was right from the pharmacy. Okay, thank you. All right then, thanks a lot. Bye.
