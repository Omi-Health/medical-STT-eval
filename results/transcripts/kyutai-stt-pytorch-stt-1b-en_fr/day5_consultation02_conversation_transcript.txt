Okay, are you in a private place so you can have a consultation today? Yes, I am. Okay, what can I do for you? It hurts when I pee. Okay, and how long has that been going on for? It stays now. Pardon? For six days. Six days, okay. And just tell me a bit more about that. How did it start? I've got this thing when I pee and it hurts when I go to the loo.

Whereabouts? In my lower tummy. Okay, is it one-sided or in the middle? In the middle. And how bad would you say that is on a scale of one to ten? With ten being the worst pain? Seven. And is it constant or does it come and go? Comes and goes. Okay, and have you actually been having regular sexual intercourse or anything? No. No, okay.

And in the past, have you had any medical problems at all? No medical, no. Have you had any problems with your kidneys or any urine infections? I had IBS before. Okay. And how's that been recently?

And anyone in your family had any medical problems? No. That's fine. And where about do you live? Do you live with friends, family? I live with friends. Okay. And where do you work? What's your job? Mr. Botwalker. Okay. Do you drink alcohol at all? Occasionally. So how much in your average week? One glass of wine a week. Okay. Do you smoke? No. Okay. It sounds very much like you might have an infection in your urine. Did you say you haven't felt feverish? No fever at all. Have you got a thermometer at home? No. Okay. It would be helpful if you could get a thermometer from the pharmacy and do you check your temperature just to make sure that it isn't going up and down. Okay. Normally we can treat this infection without having to test your urine. With the course of antibiotics. Okay. How would you feel about that? Are you happy to take a course of antibiotics? Yes, I would be. It would just be for three days? Okay. Get my prescription? Yes. So I can send a prescription through to your requested pharmacy for that. If you take them as soon as you can, pick them up as soon as you can and start taking them. The other thing which is important to do is to drink lots of water. So two and a half to three liters a day. You can get some cranberry juice and drink that as well. That's sometimes helps. And also some sachets. Which you can get from the chemists and sachets. Which just help change the acidity of your urine. So I can put the details of that on your notes. Okay then. If you feel like your pain is getting worse or not settling, you get lower back pain. Or you're getting a high temperature. You have any problems actually passing the urine, then it's very important that we speak to you again. Okay. The other thing is if it becomes a common thing or a recurrent problem, then we need to talk to you again about it. So do I have to go after I finish my course of antibiotics? No, not if you're better. Okay. If you feel like your symptoms get worse at any point or they're not resolving with the treatment. Or you keep getting a similar problem. Then it's important for us to talk to you in more detail about that. Okay then. Have you got any other questions? No. What would be the pharmacy I'll be picking up? My medication from? So have you already requested a pharmacy through Babylon? Yes, I did. Can I just check that with you? Knightsbridge.
