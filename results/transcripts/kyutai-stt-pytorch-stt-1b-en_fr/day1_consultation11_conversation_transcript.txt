Hello? Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me okay? I can hear you, but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Is that okay? Am I meant to just listen to the connection on the screen? This audio, no, no, it's absolutely fine. Now, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? I'm saying my name is Dan Chowdhury. I am 27, okay. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan? So I've just been having some troubles. Basically, I guess it's been a little while now, and I've just been feeling not so great. And it's all come from like, it's like basically I think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out like loads of it. Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and yeah, it doesn't feel very solid. So it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's yeah, it's just not being very pleasant. And like I just it just kind of hasn't doesn't feel like it's getting better. Wow, no, sorry to hear. It seems like there's a lot going on there. When did it all start, your symptoms? So I think it was a few when I think about it. So Monday, Tuesday, I saw I think it was about three. It's been about three days now. Okay. And is it mainly diarrhea? So you mentioned watery stools. How many times are you going a day, would you say? So I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Right. You're losing a lot of fluid there. Yeah. So I mean, I'm trying to drink a lot of water. But yeah, it's just quite a lot. And it's yeah, I think I feel like it's just just fluids coming out. Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stools? So no, I don't remember anything like no, I think it's just nothing like that. There's nothing. And any any tummy pain, any any any pain in your tummy? Yeah, I mean, I feel I feel a cramp and then I know it's time to go. Right. So around every hour, I just feel something come up and then I have to go. So yeah, I mean, that's that's the kind of first sign. Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? It's kind of as I want to if I think about it, it's like it's like at the bottom. I don't know if that makes sense. Well, why don't we start with is it is it in the middle or is it to one particular side? I think it feels pretty like in the middle to me, not on any side, left to right. Okay. And this is pain come and go or is there constantly? It comes and goes. It comes and goes. Fine. Okay. And if I was to ask you, let's get a one to ten, ten being the worst pain you ever had. How bad is this pain? Okay, so like I don't Apart from pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, yeah, I definitely feel kind of nauseous. Like I've had vomited when I, like, I think it's maybe something to do with like, whenever I have like milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit and actually like, yeah, one time I just like had some milk and I just completely vomited it. Sorry, can you repeat that? The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhea, is that right? Unknown, no, it's not. Okay, okay, all right. Any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? So, yeah, I think I am pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that, but it's, yeah, I'm sure I'm not a normal temperature. Okay, so you're feeling hot, okay. In terms of your water work, so are you passing urine, okay? Yeah, but I guess less frequently maybe. But yeah, it seems to be okay. Okay, all right. Fine, and you said that it mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you, for example, gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else with diarrhea, for example? So, my brother has actually had something like this for five, he has it as well for five days as well. And I'm not, yeah, I can't think of what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally can deal with this stuff a lot better than me, but yeah, that's why. Your brother now better? So, he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not really sure. He said he had something for a little while as well. Okay, all right. Are you having anything to eat and drink? I can see you're drinking your coffee, but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? So, it just feels like, the fluids do go down, but it just feels like it's going straight through. It just feels like it's going straight through. Okay, all right, fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat? Which you kept in? I mean, I had some lunch today. But again, it just came to come out pretty loose. Okay, all right. And Dan, moving forward, are you otherwise fit and well? Do you have any other medical history? So, I'm fit and well. Yeah, I mean, I'm okay weight. I can't think of any related medical history. I mean, yeah, no, I don't think so. I'll take it you don't take any regular medications then? So, I don't What about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? So with bowel, like, is the colon like something? Yeah, so what I mean by bowel is a whole gut to it. Anything from the mental illness? So yeah, my dad actually has colon cancer at the moment. Oh dear, I'm very sorry to hear that. How is he? So from what I heard, he's kind of, so I don't speak to him that often. So I don't know the exact details and I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer. He's sort of in his third stage. I'm not sure what that means exactly. So yeah, I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting him a lot. And that's what he thinks. He's quite, I guess he's had it for a little while now. I'm really sorry to hear. I'll make a note though, because it's a little important to know he's kind of details. And socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan? Not my brother. He doesn't live with me. I live with my sister and my mum. And how are things at home? What sense? Do you mean that? In general, day to day life, are you managing okay? And you particularly? I mean, I think it's been tricky. Going to work with all of this.
