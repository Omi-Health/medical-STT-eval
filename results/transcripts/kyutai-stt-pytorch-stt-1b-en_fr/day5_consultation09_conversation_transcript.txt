Hi there, it's Dr Smith from Babylon. Hi there. Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address, please? Yeah, it is When do you think you were last, well, where are we now? Just started April. Definitely Christmas New Year. I felt relatively well, I think. So since then, actually, yeah, I was on holiday in in the States and yeah, probably coincided with sometime around then. End of January, start of February. Do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back? Probably a couple of weeks after I got back. Were you well when you were on holiday? Yeah, I think I had a great time, very active. Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhea, vomiting, anything like that? No, not that I recall. Yeah, not no, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards. OK, so just tell me what symptoms you've been having in terms of just your general health, any persistent cold symptoms or aerate sore throat, chest, cough, shortness of breath, phlegm, anything like that? Any change in your weight at all? I don't think so. I'm probably less hungry, but no, no weight change, just a bit. Are you eating different amounts? Yeah, probably slightly smaller, portions or more of an effort to actually eat everything that's in front of me. Any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat or abdominal pain? No, any change in your wild habit, diarrhea, vomiting or blood in the stool? No, any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine? No, that's all fine. OK, and any other general symptoms like rashes, how many rashes now? In fact, I've got a photo on my phone and if that's helpful. OK, try and show you. Hang on. Because this, yeah, this was weird. This sort of came up and then I disappeared after a couple of weeks. That went the light. And then that whereabouts was it? I think sort of carp. Back of my carp, because I didn't notice it, my wife noticed it actually. When did you first notice it? Probably around the end of February. The middle to end of February. And then it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time. And it faded over a couple of weeks, I guess. Did you have any fevers at that time? To be honest, that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat I had. So possibly a little bit feverish, but I sort of put it down to that. Do you know where you got that when it started? Had you been walking? Did you get any bites that you noticed? I do quite a lot of walking. We did quite a lot while we were out in the sun holiday as well. But definitely around No, the sort of headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy. And have you been able to go for bath procedural? I've been going to work, I don't know how effective it's been, but yeah, I've been. What's your job? I work for a health technology company actually. Okay, and has your concentration been affected or your time has settled in the daytime at work? Yeah, definitely sort of tired and yeah, less energy sort of, probably getting aged than I would normally be. Have you been able to exercise okay? No, not as much. I don't know if it's, I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it. I'm not exercising as much as I would normally. Okay, fine. And how's your mental health, your stress levels, all that? Pretty good at the moment actually. Previously that has been an issue, but other than sort of physically feeling a bit crappy, I've been in a pretty good place. Okay, apart from that rash, any other rashes on your skin or swelling of your joints or pain in your joints? Yeah, sort of aching, shoulders, back, the hips, knees, but sort of, yeah, not any of that. Swelling that you've noticed? No. Well, how happens to wrists, ankles, toes? No. Okay, and any other significant medical problems in the past? I mean, 80% of my count. Pardon? Asthma and hay fever if they count. Okay, any flare ups you've got asthma recently? No, pretty well, I think I I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the normal things, like liver, kidneys, blood count, except for, but also some more specific things, like bacterial infection, you can sometimes get, including one that you can get, which can produce a rash like that. So that would involve blood tests, so you're happy to do that. Yeah, and I don't know how people get blood tests. What's the infection? Well, you can get bacterial infection caused, it was called Lyme disease, but you can get a rash like that from a tick pot, so that's something you would do a test for, as well. Okay. And if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it, so it's definitely worth checking for, but we would also check just for other things, which can cause reduced energy, tiredness, and aching, but persistent over six weeks. Okay. So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line, and then when you've had the test arranged, a follow-up, that week after you've had the test,
