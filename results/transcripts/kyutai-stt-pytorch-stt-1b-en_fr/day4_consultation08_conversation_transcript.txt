Hello? Hi, hi there. My name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors at Babylon. I just, can I confirm your name, please? Yeah, my name is Joe. So your name was? Name was Brian. Brian, hi Brian. Nice to meet you. And your date of birth? Yeah, my date of birth is the 8th of August, 1982. Great. And are you in a sort of confidential place where you can speak freely? Yeah, no one else can hear me. Great, and you're happy to continue with the consultation? Yes. Marvellous. Okay, so how can I help today? Yeah, so basically it's just been happening over the last few weeks or so. But I don't really feel like getting up in the morning is really difficult, and I don't have much energy at all. During the day. Often, yeah, just like doing most things that I would normally find easy. It's become quite difficult. Okay, so things have become quite difficult for you. Yeah. Is there anything else? It's quite hard to say. Things like I'm not eating very much at the moment. I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy. Okay, well I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had difficulty waking up, no energy, not eating. And that's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks, do you mean two or three? Now I kind of think about it maybe even longer. I guess it might be related to this. So I also started a new job, slightly recently. It might have even coincided with that job a couple of months ago. When did you start your new job? Two months ago, did you say? Yeah. Okay. And so this has been going on perhaps for sort of six weeks or so. More like two months, I would say. Okay. All right, so I I'm not sure how that is, what the best way is of doing that, but it gives some advice or whatever, that'd be really useful. Okay, sure. Okay, well, what would I like to do is just ask you a few more sort of questions around what's been going on, and also around your background health and things like that. And then we can go on to sort of what can be done from there. Is that right? Okay. Okay, great. So you say you've been feeling unwell with not a lot of energy, difficult waking up in the mornings. Do you tend to just on that, do you tend to wake up early and then stay in bed in the morning? Actually, I'm just not really waking up early. It's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all, probably. I think that's probably close. Difficulty sleeping as well. Yeah. And have you, how is your mood been over this period? Have you been feeling, were you just dragged? I'd say. I kind of finding it really hard to quite difficult to keep focusing, I would say. Not unhappy or happy, but just quite, just not focused. Okay. So difficulty focusing, quite distracted. And would you say you've been in good spirits or is your mood low? Actually, now you mentioned it, like my mood is a bit lower recently. And so I've noticed like my sex drive has kind of decreased. A bit over the past few months as well. So, yeah. And so, lower mood, decreased sex drive recently as well. And just on that note, just a few questions around that. Are you able to, maybe slightly personal questions, but if you're okay to answer this, do you tend to have morning erections like you? I have not noticed those recently. Okay, so and that's been a change, has it? Important one, I don't think. Sorry? Yeah, I don't think it's an important change. So you don't think there's been a change there? No, there hasn't been a change there. Oh, okay, sorry. Okay, so just going back to the mood symptoms as well. When you've had difficulty focusing, easily distracted, your mood has been slightly lower with lower sex drive. And in what way is your sex drive being lower? Are you in a relationship at the moment? Yeah, I'm married. I've been for many years. Yeah, just I over the last few months, just been disinterested. Okay, sorry, you froze there for a moment. So less interested as well. Okay, and just to ask you a few questions before we go. Sorry, can you say that again, please? Hyper, as in high, hyperthyroid. Hypo, okay, hypothyroid, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, and... Also, in the past, I mean, I haven't had any kind of specific medical diagnoses along these lines. But they're suspicion that it may have had an impact on me. But my father has committed suicide. 15 years ago. Okay. Okay. And I have a drug history of thyroxine. So maybe, yes. Do you continue to take thyroxine now? Yes. You do? So you're taking thyroxine at the moment? Yes. Cool. And any drug allergies? Are you allergic to any medications? No, I have no medication allergies. No allergies. And you mentioned the suicide of your father 15 years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other significant family history of medical conditions or psychiatric conditions? No. No depression or anything like that running in your family or? I think that's all. Okay. And your mother is well? Any brothers or sisters? Yeah, she's fine. I know I'm an only child. Okay. So I just, so I'm slightly around the question, but any change in your vision? No, no, nothing like that. No change of vision. Okay. And just to go back to your, you're saying you had low mood. Some people who do have low mood and low sex drive can sometimes feel suicidal as well. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else? No. No, not really. And are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities that you have done in the past? Sometimes. I mean, I guess I Okay, so you've become more short of breath over the last few months. Yeah. And you've had a No, nothing specific. So do That would be ideal, I think, here. And then we can, yes, we can probably do some more, or do an examination and do some investigations, really, to see what's going on here a little bit more. That makes sense, yeah. Is that all right? Yeah, that's very useful. Thank you. Okay. Better to have some kind of plan. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I definitely think we need a plan here. It's been nice talking to you. I'm sorry we ran out of time now. But we've at least started the ball rolling with some further investigations and tests. I'm glad that although you have a low mood, you're not feeling suicidal, just to confirm that. And we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some of your tiredness and your other symptoms. And we'll see you, okay? Thank you very much for taking the time. Okay, thank you, thanks.
