Hi there, good morning. I'm Dr. Dean Mesut from Babylon. Can you hear me okay? Can you find me? Yeah, okay, great. Well, nice to see you this morning. Before we start your appointment, can I confirm your full name and date of birth, please? Yes. Jack Smith. 31st of October 1990. That's perfect. Thank you, Jack. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? I am, yes. Okay, great. So, tell me what's been going on. You've been saying there's a problem with your hearing, is that right? Yes, I just feel like I can't really hear as well as I used to, like my hearing is kind of deteriorating in some way. Right, okay. How long has this been going on for? About six weeks. Six weeks, okay. And before that, have you had any hearing problem at all? I had something maybe about a year ago, but it only lasted a couple of days. It wasn't anything as long as this. Right, okay. And in this six-week period, have you had anything else happen? Have you had any other ear symptoms at all? So we need to exclude that first and then after that we can consider other potential possibilities And for that we need to have a look inside the eardrum. So what I think we could do is Maybe if we book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics, it's not an emergency It can be done within the next four or five days or so. Okay, and then What I'll do is I'll send a message to our admin team. I'll ask them to slot you into in a clinic one of our clinics in that time frame you can come in and one of the GPs will just have a quick look down the ear and figure out whether there's a physical blockage or whether there's something else going on. Okay, can I just double check? The dizziness that you've been getting How severe is it? Nothing major. It's just kind of It's not the kind of dizziness you get with nausea like Proper room spinning or anything like that, but just just a little bit kind of off balance and right, right? Have you any chest pain with it? No, no palpitations heartbeats and fast So let's get your ear checked out I think that would be the most sensible thing to do and then after that we can will be a step closer to figure out which way we're going to go it might be that there's a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear, but we just need to exclude whether there's a physical blockage first and try and deal with that if that's the case, okay? Sort of thing that can cause This ringing up wet my ear The ringing that you've got that you've got something called tinnitus And tinnitus is something actually that medicine doctors We don't really understand it fully we haven't you know, people can't give you a specific cause for why some patients get tinnitus and some patients don't it can be triggered by a wide range of different things and in fact, I'm glad that you mentioned that what I might do in the time between now and when you come for the appointment I'm going to put paste the link for a leaflet about tinnitus In the notes for this appointment. I really appreciate it. If you could start reading about it Okay, and often that that awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are and they're limited options That helps us in terms of conversation about what we do next if your ear is clear Okay, so I'm going to paste a link to that and you can read about that and What we'll do is we'll see you in about four or five days time. It won't be with me It'll be another GP, but they'll have my notes and they'll know exactly what what my question is, which is just a check your ears Is that okay? Yes, that's great. All right, great. So bear with me five minutes and then you can run the support team I'll leave the number in the notes for this appointment bring them and then they'll stop you in. Okay Okay, brilliant. All right, if any if there's any problem any issues Between now and when the clinic appointment is just book another appointment and you can speak to one or certain video. Okay All right, then take it nice to see this way
