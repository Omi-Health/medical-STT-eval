Hello. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, I hear you. Right, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Sure. I'm Amanda Jackson and I'm 19 years old. 19 years old, okay. Amanda, how can I help you this afternoon? So it's been going on for a few days now. It's not happened before and I'm a bit worried. It's quite hurts when I kind of pee. And yeah, it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more. And it's really like I can't like go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. It kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in the bottom of my tummy as well. Right, okay. I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there. Yeah, it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days, I think, actually. Maybe just under a week. Oh, under a week, sorry. Sorry, no, I didn't explain it properly before. Yeah, no, it's been going on for about just under a week. And yeah, I noticed sort of burning, stinging when I go to the toilet. Yeah. Have you noticed anything in your urine, for example, any blood or discoloration of urine? I think, well, today I noticed that it was like a bit pink. The urine. Yeah. I think just today. Have you noticed any kind of frank blood? I mean, red blood at all in your urine? I think it was mixed in, probably. I don't know, it was pink. Okay. Fine, well, we'll have to explore that in a little bit. More detail later on. You also mentioned some tummy pain as well. Can you tell me a bit more about that pain? Yeah, it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy. Mainly when I go to the loo. I think that's when it's worse. Okay. Can you describe a bit of crampy pain? Is it more of a burning pain? I wouldn't describe it as crampy. I don't think it's like a period pain. It's a bit different. It's hard to say, an achy pain, I suppose. Okay, okay. There's a pain move anywhere else. There's a move towards your back, towards your sides. No, no. Okay, all right. Any other symptoms as well, for example, nausea, vomiting? No. No nausea, vomiting. Okay, any temperatures or fevers? No, no, not diagnosed. Okay, all right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are you bowels working okay? I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any different. Okay. From what it usually is. When you say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have? I think I have, um, IBS. So I just kind of pass over my bowels like quite a lot. And sometimes it's quite variable. Like sometimes it's a bit softer. Sometimes it's a bit, sorry, this is a bit disgusting, but like. Yeah, you're not a bit. Okay, all right. But you know there's no unique issues. No, no, no new symptoms in your bowels. No, no, not that I'm going to do that. All right. And Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions, as you can imagine. Can I ask, are you currently, are you currently sexually active? Yeah, I have, When was the last time you had unprotected sex? If you don't want me to ask you. I mean, unprotected is a no condoms or anything. Yeah, exactly. I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend. I don't know, we've just kind of agreed. When was your last period? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, okay. All right. Just something for us to bear in mind, if you're attempting something any better, okay. Fine. In terms of your general health, otherwise at the moment, are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, yeah, eating and drinking okay. I did have one kind of concern. I don't know. So I smoked this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time. Like a week and a half ago, I just wonder whether it's related at all. Probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. Sure. Well, thanks for sharing with me. So I don't think it is related to your symptoms. I think it's probably just pure coincidence. But I do strongly advise you to make it a regular habit if you can. Just for your general health moving forwards, okay. Moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions? Apart from the IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of? No, no. Okay, great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis, apart from the combined pill? Apart from the pill, I take something for the IBS as well. It begins with an M. It's really hard to pronounce, like med-ed, something. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Okay, and then up the cramps, the crampy pain. Yeah. Yeah, thank you. And do you have any allergies to any medications? Yeah, I think there's an antibiotic called Clindas, Clindamycin. I'm studying English. English, okay, good. And how are you enjoying your course? Yeah, yeah, it's going well. Thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago, a few months ago. Yeah, I really enjoy it. Very, very good. Good. In terms of smoking and alcohol, do you do participate in either? As I admitted before, I tried weed for the first time, but I don't smoke. I drink occasionally. Okay, what's made you have your first joint last week? I was just a party and there were other people doing it. I kind of was a little bit pipsy, so probably wasn't thinking quite straight. But yeah, I completely agree. It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure, and obviously as you drop something into the cup, so you say, oh, I'll strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid it. Great. Fine, so as they said, I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think I'm reassured by the fact, I think it's probably just as simple when we say UTI or cystitis, bladder infection. You know, you haven't put any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about, so things like fevers and back pain. We'll see what the urine sample shows. And if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. But if things are still getting better next week, come back and see me. And we can have another look again. Okay. Okay. Great. With the urine sample, how do I go about doing that? Have a good day. Okay. Thank you. You too. Bye
