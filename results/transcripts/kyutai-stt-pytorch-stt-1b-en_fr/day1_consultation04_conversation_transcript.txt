Alex? Hello. How can you hear me? Yeah. Okay, great. How can I help you this morning, sir? Hi, sir. I've been feeling kind of under the weather for the past four days. It started with a sore throat and runny nose. And it sort of, it sort of going into a cough now. The sore throat is kind of going away, but I'm starting to cough. Okay. Sorry to hear that. Kind of bad and tired. Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. I think that there's a lot going on there. So let's start with your sore throat first. Tell me a bit more about that, if you can. So I think I had all started with the colleague of mine. She just kept sneezing. Next to me all the time. I think her kids are catching something from the kindergarten or something. And it started as normal sore throat. I was quite painful for a couple of days, but then it was fast. Okay. Okay. And do you have any difficulty or pain or swallowing? Yeah. Yeah. It was quite painful to swallow. Okay. For one of the days. Did you manage to have a look in the back of your throat in the mirror? No, not really. No. Okay. You don't notice any abnormal white spots, redness at the back of your throat? No. I didn't think of that. Looking. That's okay. That's okay. And you mentioned the runny nose. Again, what kind of discharge is coming out? Is it clear or is it a bit more colored? Yeah. Yeah. It's clear, but I I'm an accountant. Okay, and how's your work going at the moment over the last, has it, has it been affecting your work? A little bit, I've been a bit slower, and you know, it's, it's, it's a bit of a stressful period just around the end of the year. Okay, is that stress affecting your, your mood at all, in any way? No, I think, I think it's, it's the, you know, it's the good kind of stress. Okay, it's good work. Well, if there's anything you ever want to talk to me about, you can always come and see me, about your mood, and stress, anxiety, we're happy to help. I like my job, it's just, you know, it's a bit more work. Okay, okay, and just very briefly, in terms of smoking, do you smoke at all? Yeah, occasionally, you know, cigars and things on company parties. Okay, so not, not regular. And what about alcohol? Occasionally, I would have some, not a very big drinker. Again, socially with work. Okay, so I just haven't listened to your story. Really, just to summarize, you know, it's the last four days you've been feeling generally quite unwell, sore throat, runny nose, a bit of a dry cough, a bit of muscle pain, weakness. Had an initial fever, but now settled. I don't think there's a lot to worry about. I think you probably have, you know, a bit of a viral, what we say, viral illness, and maybe a viral upper spiritual tract infection, or maybe early signs of a flu. It normally lasts for about seven to 10 days and just gets better, really, over time. But things you can do to really help yourself is get plenty of rest. I'll probably advise you taking a day or two of work if you can. Making yourself, you know, pushing fluids will make yourself well hydrated. Continue with a regular paracetamol and ibuprofen. And we should see how things go, really. If next week you're still not better, I'd like you to come back and see me. Is that clear? Does that make sense? I think I felt I'll take a couple of days off. Yeah. See how it goes. And things to look out for if you're really not getting better, if you have a high fever or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored or chest pain. I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner. Give me a call. We can help you out. Okay. Yeah, I understood. I'll take care. Great. Have a great day. Good luck with your work. Thank you. Thank you.
