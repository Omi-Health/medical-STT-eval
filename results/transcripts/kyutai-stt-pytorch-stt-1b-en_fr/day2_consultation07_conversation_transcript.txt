Thank you so much for that. You look a lot younger. So that would make you roughly about 50 years old, 51, 51 years old. Is that correct? Yeah, yeah, around that. Yeah, about 60. Yeah. All right. So nice to see you this morning. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes, I am. Yeah. Okay, fantastic. So how can I help you today? Yeah, I was I was having a bit of chest discomfort. So I was doing some gardening, a couple of hours ago. And I felt not exactly a pain, but like a pressure on my chest. Feels like someone sitting on my chest. And I've noticed a bit of nausea, not no vomiting, but I'm pretty sweaty. Short of breath. And it kind of feels like someone sitting on my chest. Right. Okay. Now, do you have those these symptoms right now? Or have they gone off now? No, they're still present. Okay, so you've still got the chest discomfort right now? Yes. Okay. We're probably gonna have to call an ambulance for you to pick up. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to task my colleague next to me. So let's sort that out. While we do that, I'm going to ask you a few more questions. Okay. A bit more information to the ambulance team when they when they arrive. Okay. So just just a double check. Where exactly in the chest is the pain? It's in the middle of my chest. Over my pecs. So yeah, but not necessarily to one side. And it's quite a diffuse pain. Right. Is it spreading anywhere else? I don't do your arm up to the jaw and the neck and you like that? Yeah, it's it's mainly my left arm. It's feeling a little bit. Painful and in my shoulder as well. Right. Okay. Do you remember what you were doing at the time? Yeah, so it started just when I was gardening. So nothing that was too strenuous. I was just kneeling down and yeah, wasn't running or anything.

I generally don't do much activity at all. Yeah. Have you had this before? No, this is the first time actually. Right. Okay. Are you aware of any palpitations like your heart beating faster or more prominently than normal? Yeah, it's it's beating a bit faster now. I think that's because I'm a little bit stressed about the situation, but I haven't noticed it beating faster than usual. Today. So I know you're stressed. We've got an ambulance coming on the way. Okay. We'll take care of everything. So don't don't. Okay. The house with you at the moment? No, no one's in the house at the moment. Okay. And is your front door open? Yes, it's open.
