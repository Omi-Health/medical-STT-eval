Hello, can you hear me okay? Hey, yes, I can. Can you hear me? Yeah, good, good. So my name is Joe. I'm a doctor here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? Hey, my name is Vincent. And your date of birth? 9th of May 2016. Okay, great. Sorry. And are you in a safe place? Oh, sorry, a safe and confidential place to talk and just... I have to go ahead with consultation. Yes, yes, I am. Great. So how can I help? Yeah, so I have a call that I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week and it's been causing me problems. I've had to stay away from work. For about three or four of those days because of how bad it is. Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week. And what came first? The sore throat came first and then after a day or two the cough. Okay, okay. And are you coughing up anything? No, it's very dry. Okay, so I'm just going to ask a few questions about your current symptoms and a little bit about your background. And something else about what we can do a little bit later on in the consultation to help you. But before I go, anything you're particularly concerned about or have any ideas what might be going on? You said that you had a cold. Well, I mean, you know how we all are. Once this happens, you Google it and it seems to be all kinds of bad things. It could be a cold or flu, obviously, but it could also be tuberculosis. It could be cancer, all this kind of stuff. So it would be good if none of those... Right, so yeah, I can provide a little bit of reassurance. And we can talk about those a little bit as well. And was there anything you particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation? Well, yeah, so reassurance. So hopefully some sense that it's not anything too serious. But also, if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better or any advice or maybe even a sick note. So if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer, I can get one. Sure, sure. Okay, all right. So we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms and I'm sure we can get those things sick and crisp and some reassurance. You're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well. Yes. Okay. And when did you start to develop a shortness of breath? Let's see. So the sore throat, so today it's Friday, sore throat was about last week, Friday or Thursday. I've got a full Saturday or Sunday. So the shortness of breath was a thing shortly after the cough, so maybe a day or two later. So three, four days ago. Three or four days ago, you started to develop shortness of breath. And is the cough worse at night time? No, it's the same throughout the day. Same throughout the day. And when you say you're short of breath, just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are. So are you able to walk up the flight of stairs, for example, or are you short of breath at rest? Yeah, so when I'm doing walking, and I do exercise now and then, so it hasn't been super bad, like it hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual and a little bit worried. And you're a bit concerned about that, okay. So I just need to ask you a few things about your background as well. So do you have any other medical conditions or medical history? No, just no, no past medical history, no. No past medical history. No history of asthma? No. And any history of clots on your legs or your lungs? These are peas. Not on your families have those, clots on the legs or lungs? Well, my mother had lung cancer. Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke? No. You ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos? You know, I don't know what asbestos, ever smoked. I mean, once or twice in Amsterdam, if that counts, but not really. Okay. And this... We're just going back to your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough. It's a dry cough, no, not coughing up any phlegm. Do you have any... You say you don't have any chest pain as such? Are you taking any medications? No, I'm not. Okay. Are you allergic to any medications? Not to any medication, but I'm allergic to peanuts. Peanuts. Okay. And I No, it seems to be all in entirely with just my throat, like my nose is turning up, just your throat, and any recent travel, or have you always lived in the UK? No, so I haven't always lived in the UK, like, so I was born in the US, and moved over, about 12 years ago, but in terms of recent travel, just to Europe, nowhere to Antarctic. Okay, so no recent travel, no significant recent travel, anywhere. Okay, and are you coughing up anything other than you're not coughing up blood, or anything like that? Good, and are you feeling feverish, hot, cold, sweaty? Yeah, so a little bit feverish, at first, so the first three or so days of this, but then the fever is going away. Okay, and in general, do you have a fever, sorry? Yeah, I was just going to say also had a bit of a headache. Like, headaches that come and go either, but like right now it's fine. Okay, and in general, would you say you're feeling, you're beginning to feel better, worse, or sort of staying the same? So it's up and down, so let's see, so I started last week, and I stayed home from work two days this week. I think it was maybe Tuesday and then Thursday, so like I felt better and then worse again, and then better and then worse again, so it's been, yeah, I kind of constant, but constant in being, very well, that makes sense. Okay, and I just really need to ask any other sort of risk factors, that you may have, so no sort of significant weight loss, or unexplained weight loss, any wonders? So no weight loss, but I have been, I have been losing my appetite recently, and I mean, I usually eat a lot, so I enjoy eating as well, but like, that's been a bit concerning. You've been losing your appetite recently? Yes. And you're a little bit concerned about that? But you haven't, you haven't lost any weight, do you think? No, not that. And any, sort of rashes or anything, any symptoms If you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness, or breathlessness that you are concerned about, and I would advise you to seek no consent, you're going to see a GP, and actually see somebody physically, but I think for now I can sort of try and reassure you that if this clears up, as I expect it would, so expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days, if it's not, please get in touch with the medical professional again, and I would expect it too, and so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis, you're concerned about lung cancer, was that the other thing you concerned about? Oh yeah, yeah, so again, if you're not getting better, please see somebody again, I've just got four seconds now, so nice talking to you, and have you got to tidy up, yeah, okay, so yeah, and I'll provide you with a sick note, just to give you a few more days off work, and paracetamol, lots of fluids, and rest up, and as I say, if you're not feeling better, please get in touch. Okay, all right, so I'll get back. Thank you.
