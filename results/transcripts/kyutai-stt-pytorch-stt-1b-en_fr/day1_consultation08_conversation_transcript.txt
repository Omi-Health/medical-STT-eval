Okay. Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Hello, Alex. Just before we go any further, can I confirm your name and age, please? My name's Isa, and I'm 26. Okay, and how can I help you this afternoon? So basically, I've been really stressed out at work for the past few days. And I've realized that I've got really dry, itchy skin. Okay. Sorry to hear work has been so stressful. Tell me more about your skin firstly. Tell me, you mentioned it's been dry and itchy. Whereabouts on your skin? All over my arms. And my hands, mainly. Okay. And is this something you've had before? No. Did it come about quite suddenly, or was it more kind of a gradual thing? I think it started a few days ago. Okay. And has it spread anywhere else in the spreadsheet, your chest, your legs? Your face? No. Okay. So apart from being dry and itchy, any other symptoms? Has it been sore? Has it been... Have you noticed any cracked skin? So my skin's quite red. And I'm using coconut butter for the past few days. Okay. I don't have any spots. Okay. No fever. I'm not sweating either. Thank you. We'll mention all those. Okay. So the coconut butter hasn't helped? With the itch? No. Okay. And you mentioned work's been quite stressful. What do you do for work? I work as a teacher. Okay. And in what way has work been stressful? I think the kids have been really annoying these days. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. And I hope it gets better. Going back to your skin, is it anything you've done perhaps which may have triggered your symptoms? Anything you've touched or shower gels, soaps? I went swimming a few days ago. Okay. So the first time in your life or have you been before? No, I've been before. Okay. And did your symptoms start after you went swimming? Yes. Okay. All right. You mentioned you've had no other fevers. Is that right? No fevers, no vomiting. No. No. How's your health otherwise? It's pretty good. Yeah. Not on any medication. We'll get to medication in just a second. Do you feel genuinely run down? Do you feel tired? Yeah, I think I have been quite tired. Okay. Okay. Are you eating and drinking? Okay. Yeah, I've been drinking and eating as normal. Your appetite's fine, is it? Okay. And your bowels, are your bowels working okay? Yeah. No, no problems with vomiting or loose stools. No. Okay. And your water works all okay? You're possibly doing okay? Yeah. Okay. All right. So just moving on. In terms of your other medical history, is there anything else I should be aware of? I'm currently taking microchip. Microgynol? Yeah. Okay. Do you know what that is? No. Okay. It's a contraceptive pill. Does that make sense? Is that something you're, does that ring the bell now? Oh, yeah. Okay. Is it any other medications that you take? Oh, no. No. So in terms of your medication, there's no problems of skin problems in the past, things like eczema or dermatitis. No, I think it might just be the weather. Sorry, what was that? You think it's, I think it might just be the weather. The weather? Yeah. Oh, you think the weather, okay. You think the weather. Okay. No, it's okay. No, no problems. Well, move and do you suffer from allergies? Are you someone who suffers from allergies? Through allergies, medication allergies? I think I might have lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance. Okay. That could be helpful to know. Fine. In terms of family history, is there anything in the family that you're aware of? Yeah. So my dad has asthma and my mom has head fever. Head fever? Yep. Okay. Fine. But again, any skin problems I should be aware of? No. No. Okay. All right. Socially, who do you live with at home? I would just be. Live alone? Yep. And do you smoke at all? Do you can't, do you smoke? Are you a smoker? No, I don't smoke. Have you drink much in a row of alcohol? Oh, no. Recreational drugs? Yep. Okay. And you said you meant you work as a primary school teacher? Yes, that's right. The reason I ask is sometimes stress can be a contributing factor. You felt, you noticed yourself finding, life's been more stressful recently. All right. Do you think I might have any correlation to your symptoms? I mean, I don't. I don't think so. Okay. All right. Fine. Okay. Well, normally at this stage, I like to proceed examination, but based on your story, it's difficult. I think, you know, essentially the story is you've got to dry, itchy rash on your menu or hands you mentioned. And your arms, which started, perhaps after swimming a few days ago. But no other symptoms, you're feeling otherwise well, no fevers, no bleeding or discharge from skin. I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis. Have you heard of that condition before? I have, yes. Okay. Great. Well, I can give you a patient information, Leopold, about that, which gives me more information about the disease. But it's something that we can readily treat it. With a couple of options, we have steroid creams I can give you. Which will help with the inflammation. And something called emollients, which can help with the dry skin. And that's something you just need to kind of paste on. Not much of your skin. Throughout the day, for the next few days. And hopefully that helps your symptoms. Okay. Oh, thank you very much. You can also try antihistamines. So you can get things over the counter, pyrotin, laratadine. That can sometimes help with the itchiness. Yeah, that sounds good. Okay. And that's probably what I'd recommend. Paracetamol, in this case, wouldn't be helpful. Painkillers wouldn't be helpful in this occasion. But let's see how the next few days go. And if it's still not getting there, so come back and see me next week. And we can have another look again at your symptoms. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Great. Do you have any questions for me? I know. Okay. Well, I'll wish you all the best. Have a good day. Oh, thank you very much. Bye.
