Hi there, it's Dr Smith from Babylon. Hi. Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address, please? Sandra Bloom. 20th of February 1958. And your home address? Okay, how bad's your cough at the moment? It's quite bad. It's kind of quite dry. I'm coughing maybe every 20, 30 minutes or so. Okay, are you bringing up any phlegm at all? No. No? Any chest warm? Chest what, sorry? Any pain in your chest? No. Any difficulty breathing, feeling short of breath, or any pain we need to take a deep breath? No, that's all fine. Have you coughed up any blood or anything like that? Nope. And what about your no symptoms? Nothing up in here, but just constant streaming, like using a million tissues. Okay, and any blood coming from the nose? No, it's pretty green. Right, okay. Any other symptoms, like sore ears, sore throat? I had been feeling really hot, I don't know if it's fever as such, but to touch I'm quite hot, but sometimes I'm feeling really chilly and needing to be under a blanket, that sort of thing. Having touched your temperature with a thermometer? No, I haven't. Okay. And are you eating and drinking normally? Yes, kind of around when it started I had some diarrhea, but I don't know if that was associated, but since then it's all been pretty fine. Okay, so you're drinking while holding down fluids, okay? Yeah. And passing water, okay? Yeah, that's fine. You're pumping diarrhea now? Yep. Okay, that's fine. Any rushes that you've noticed? Rushes? Yeah. No, nothing like that. Any headaches or change in your vision? No, I've had quite achy muscles, but that's pretty much it. Okay, and normally, do you have any chest problems? No. Do you ever get wheezing, short of breath? I mean, like if I do it in tense exercise, then yes, but not normally. And do you regularly have any infections in your chest or anything that needs treatment normally? No, a book high pretension, so I'm on some drugs for that. I can't remember. And with your blood, with your diabetes, have you had a blood test recently? Yeah, it was normal, it was around three weeks ago, and do you know what dose of the lysinopril you're taking? 200. Okay, have you been on to pass water normally, any increase in frequency that you're passing water or any increase first? No, not particularly. And is your weight being stable? Yeah. What is your weight and height? My height is five foot five, and my weight is sixty five, kilograms. Okay, and do you smoke at all? No. Do you drink any alcohol? Yes, the odd sherry. Okay, and who do you live with at home? My partner and my dog. And do you work? Yes. I'm an office manager. Okay. And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms, anything that you've bought in the chemist? Quite a few limb sips. They seem to be helping. What do you mean by quite a few? How many in a day do you normally take? Maybe two or three, maybe like at the start of the day and at the end of the day. Okay, have you noticed any improvement in that? Yeah, it tends to soothe my throat a bit for when I'm going to sleep. Okay, do you have any allergies to anything? Sometimes I suffer from some like hay fever. Any allergies to any medications at all? Not that I'm aware of, no. Okay, so what you've described to me, it sounds like you probably have got an infection in the chest. Because you're obviously getting the symptoms from your nose and your chest. It sounds like you might have a high temperature, so it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature. Okay, I can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something. Yeah, most of the time these infections are called by viruses. So they do normally settle by themselves, but it can take a week or two. And you can consistently have the cough ongoing longer than that. The important thing to do would be to check your temperature. And if you feel like, if the temperature is ongoing, above 37.5, 38, you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down, or your cough's getting worse, you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood to come out your nose. Or any shorts of breath, chest pain. Then we certainly would need to speak to you again. With the diabetes, you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes. So it's something that we do need to be careful of. Okay, so then we would look at potentially antibiotics at that time, perhaps? Yeah, potentially. If it's not settling, all of the temperatures ongoing, getting worse, then we definitely need to talk to you again. Okay. Have you got any other questions? No, that's all fine. It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment with the limb sip. I wouldn't take, and that can taste pricey as well, so don't take any other pricey to alcohol containing products. With that, at the same time, the cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime, so it's best for your body if you just keep coughing. But if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all, then it's okay to have a little bit of cough syrup just to settle that down. Okay, cool. Okay. Do you have blood sugar checking? Equipment? I'm not at home. No. Okay. Well, if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that you will, GPS, ask you for. Okay. Great. All right, then. Take care. Thanks so much. Bye.
