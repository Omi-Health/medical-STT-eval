Hi. Hi there, it's Dr. Smith from Babylon. Hi, good afternoon. Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth, and your home address, please? Yes, my name is Mary Jill. Well, I had a garden variety stuff, cold and I do have on the far side it and so I had lasing surgery and then once I had this really bad UTI they thought it was kidney stones and so they had me actually ER and if my GP didn't call them, tell them that they don't need to give me morphine, that was kind of an awful experience but other than that, I'm pretty good, do you take any other medications apart from the ones you told me about? Well, I'll take vitamin D, I take melatonin, sometimes just for cramps I'll take ibuprofen or actually I'll take one of my taking, Aleve, whatever Aleve is, I think that's maybe setaminophen or I can't remember what class of drugs, you know, occasionally if I'm really having hard times like I'll sleeping, I'll take Xanax, but I prefer melatonin, it's just sometimes melatonin doesn't work. Okay, and any forms of your stomach or asthma, indigestion, acid, blood? No problems. What I would suggest is definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using, so as much as you can because that really does make a difference to injuries, for anything like a healing blood into the area and it gives it the best chance of getting better, so as much as you can use the ice. Obviously you're trying to stick to American program, but I would try and ease up on the running if you can and if it's painful enough that you're having to stop running then it's not a good idea to do that. It's fine to take the ibuprofen, I can prescribe you a slightly stronger anti-inflammatory, you can take regularly instead of the ibuprofen but not with the ibuprofen, but make sure you keep up with food. Ultimately we probably need to examine the knee, so the best thing I would suggest getting an appointment with a physiotherapist first, you can do like a long assessment and examination of the knee and then make an assessment as to whether we need to do any imagery to have a look inside the knee and see if there's any problem with the cartilage. Well you know I read some stuff online that maybe like my ligaments, I think it's like ACO or something like that, right? And so if that's, I mean I'm kind of like freaked out that that may break, so do you think it's that or? It's not really possible to diagnose that over the video, so we definitely would need to see you, the physio is the best point of call because they'll probably be the most likely initial treatment, but certainly the appointment times too long to wait, then we can see you in camp as well. Can you, sorry you send referral for that? Yeah, we can refer for that. If in the meantime you develop like persistent swelling, heat, redness, of the knee or high temperature, feel unwell or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it, you'd need to see a doctor urgently, so call us back in that case. Thank you, yeah, sure, I mean give me the stronger meds and I'll give that a try. Okay, I'll send it through to your pharmacy for you. Thanks so much, bye.
