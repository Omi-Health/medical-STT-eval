Hello, I'm Dr. Smith from Babylon. Hi there, can you confirm your full name, date of birth and the first line of your address, please? I'm having really bad tummy ache, like at the bottom, at the lower bottom of my belly. Right, okay, and when did it start? A few days ago, I was all way, I was doing well, everything was okay, just pretty good. It started, and it was kind of really getting worse with time. Okay, and whereabouts in your abdomen do you think it is? Can you just explain to me whereabouts it is? Yeah, it's like lower in my lower abdomen. Okay, and is it in the middle? All to one side? No, it's in the middle. And is it around your belly button or above or below that? Below, yeah, below. And is it there all the time or does it come and go? It's there all the time. Okay, and what would you say it is on a scale of one to ten with ten being the worst pain you've ever had? It might be an eight. Okay, and have you, are you having any other symptoms with it? Yeah, like as in like I have like vaginal, sometimes BBD, but it's like light colour and sometimes I'm constipated. Okay, so when was your last period? Last month, two weeks ago, I'm sorry, about two weeks, three weeks ago. Okay, and are you having sexual intercourse regularly? Yes, yes, I do four weeks ago, I do four days ago, sorry, I just started. Are you using any contraception? Yes, I am, I use it from last one year and in planon, call it planon. Okay, and do you have your period, do you have your periods when you, since you've been using the implanon, do you have periods? Yes, I do. Or are they sporadic? No, they are sporadic, like most, the time it changes, yeah. Right, okay. And was your last period normal? Yeah, and any problems with nausea or vomiting? Yeah, I feel nausea, like I feel like vomiting, but I don't, I get nauseated, but I don't vomit. Right, and have you been eating and drinking okay? Yeah, yeah, my reclined readings and drinking, other things, okay, yeah, but it just, a very uncomfortable time. Okay, and have you opened your bowels normally? Sorry? Have you opened your bowels normally? You've been to the bathroom? I had problems, but this week it's... What problems did you have last week? Like I was constipated for a week. Yeah, my period stopped like last two weeks ago, and this is different, I can see, because it's not really like dark, it just like pink colors, or I don't know what is it, I don't know, say what exactly what it is, but I can't see it in the... Any abnormal discharge, other discharge, or just this light bleeding? Just a very small extra, other vaginal discharge, just... Any difficulty breathing or pain in your shoulders or anything like that? No? And have you had a high temperature? Have you got a thermometer? No, I don't, I should be okay. Do you feel feverish? No. And do you feel faint when you stand up? No. What have you been doing for the last few days? Have you been at work as normal, or had to stay at home? Yes, I have been, I'm doing... I work, I like doing like cooking and stuff, everything. It seems okay just when I get the pain, it just very bad. Okay, but you said the pain's constant, they're all the time, or is it getting worse from time to time? It is getting worse, yeah, definitely. Okay, have you had any other medical problems in the past? Yeah, I have allergy, I have epilepsy. Pardon? I'm more excellent. Yeah, I'm a teacher, okay, and who do you live with at home? My husband and my husband's family. Okay, and do you smoke or drink alcohol? Some of them. You take any other drugs? No. Have you been abroad recently? Yes. Whereabouts too? Out in the air. Pardon? Yeah, about a year ago, not recently. No? And any problems passing water? No. Any pain or strong smell or having to go more often than normal? No, I don't really, I have noticed that I don't really go often, like before, so yeah, I do, I can't drink a lot though. Right, okay, and any change, any, weight loss or blood in the stool or urine? Yes, I have, as I said, I have some, I can see some charge and bleeding, but then I do other things that there is not. Fine. I think, with the abdominal pain, as it's getting worse and it's been going on for the last few days, it would be very helpful to be able to examine you properly. Would you be happy to have an examination with a doctor? Yes. Okay. So what we can do is we can arrange a face-to-face examination where they can see you in a clinic and do an abdominal examination and advise further from them when we've got more of an idea what schools in the problem. Would you, be happy to call the support line and arrange that appointment? Yes. Okay, that's fine. So we'll do that. In the meantime, if it gets a lot worse, or you're not holding any fluids down, then we should see you before then. Did you say your pregnancy test was a month ago? Yes. Okay. And your implant on was just put in a year ago? Yes. The other thing we would need to do is to do a pregnancy test today, if possible. I would do it. So if you can do that today, and if it's positive, we need to see you straight away, so give us a call back. Okay. Have you got any other questions? No. Right. Okay. So if you call the support line and make an appointment, we'll go from there. Thank you. Thanks.
