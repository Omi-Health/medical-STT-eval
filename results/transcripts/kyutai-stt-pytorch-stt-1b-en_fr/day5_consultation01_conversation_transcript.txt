Oh, hello, I'm Dr. Gerrity. Oh, I'm sorry. No, that's fine. Can I take your full name, date of birth and your home address, please? Yeah, it's And are you in your date of birth? It's the 20th of August 1990. Okay, and are you in a private place so you can have a confidential consultation today? Yes, I am. What can I do for you today? I've got a really bad headache. I've had it for about a day now. Okay, and can you just tell me about how it started, what were you doing when it came on? Yeah, just yesterday morning since I woke up, really. Just, yeah, kind of throbbing, headache. I'm really wanting to leave the house much since then. Okay, and whereabouts in your head is the pain? Mainly on the left side. Okay, and what does it feel like? It just kind of feels like it's throbbing. It's quite intense. It sort of comes and goes. Yeah, quite sensitive to light. Yeah, quite painful. When you say it comes and goes, does it completely go away? It just kind of fades, so it's still there a little bit, but it kind of gets more or less severe. Okay, and any other symptoms that you've had, any problems with your eyes No, not really any sort of cold symptoms. I was doing okay the day before. Okay, and at the moment, how are you feeling? It's still pretty bad. Yeah, still just kind of bobbing. Have you had any changes in your skin? No, skin's been fine. Have you checked your temperature at all? Have you got a thermometer at home? I haven't. I don't feel like I'm feverish, but I haven't checked. And any problems with weakness, tingling, numbness in your arms or legs? No, not at all. And what have you been doing since it came on? Have you been able to go to work or have you been at home? Taking some painkillers, mainly been at home. Yeah, just kind of trying to see things do worse when, I mean, a light room or like sunlight, so I've kind of been staying in as much as possible. Okay, does it get worse with any position that you're in? Is it worse with new life flat or when you bend forward? No, I think I've generally been lying down, to be fair to that way. Any problems if you cough or sneeze? No, but I haven't really got a cough or anything. Okay, can you just tell me a bit about your medical history in the past? Have you had any significant medical problems, any hospital admissions, operations, anything like that? No, not recently, nothing. Do you take any medication? No, just cough deception. And which cough deception do you think? Microgynons. Did you start that one? About six years ago. Do you get any side effects from it? Not really. No, not too much. Okay, and anyone in your family, how do you get medical problems? My mum had a high blood pressure and she's got a history of migraines. And have you had your blood pressure checked through her recently? I haven't actually, no. Have you had it checked when you've had the repeat prescription done? Yeah, yeah, so probably about six months ago. Do you know if there's been any problems with it? It's always been fine, I think. Okay. And whereabouts do you live at the moment? You can really just do, who do you live with at home? Just with housemates. Okay, and do you drink much alcohol day to day? I'd say a normal amount. Probably, you know, a few drinks at the weekend. Okay, and do you smoke? No. Do you take any other drugs of any sort? No. So, see, what tablets do you just leave until you're ready? Sorry? What tablets have you been taking already for it? I just had a second mile. I'm allergic to aspirin, so I haven't been taking that. What happens when you get, when you take aspirin? I just feel really sick. Okay, and have you ever taken any non-steroid or anything countries, like ibuprofen, naproxen, anything like that? I have in the past, I haven't been taking it. Not like a thing, girl. I did a bit of stress out at work, that kind of thing. Well, that would be the first thing to do, is to take some anti-inflammatories along with the paracetamol, make sure you're really well hydrated, and see how that goes. And if it isn't settling, or it's getting worse, or you get any other change in your headache, or you're unwell with it, with a high temperature, then we would certainly need to speak to you straight away about that. The other thing is, if you're getting persistent headaches, or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle, or certain things seem to trigger these headaches, then it would be worth having a further discussion about it to see whether we can work out if we can help that longer term. Okay, brilliant. Thank you. I would try and make sure you get your blood pressure checked, if you haven't had it checked for a while. Okay, Carol. I'm going to do, if you have a thermometer at home, so you can make sure that your temperature is okay. Yeah. If you have a raised temperature, or your headache is just getting worse, you're going to be developing any rashes or anything like that, then we need to speak to you straight away. Yeah, okay, that's brilliant. Okay, so I'll take some iProte then, and I'll hopefully be a bit better in a day or two then, so yeah. Okay, so have you got any other questions? No, that was it today. Okay. Okay, then we'll speak to you again
