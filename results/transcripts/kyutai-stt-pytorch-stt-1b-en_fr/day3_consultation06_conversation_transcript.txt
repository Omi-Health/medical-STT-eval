Hello, hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hi, I'm Ben. You're right. So just before we start, is it alright if you could confirm your name for me, please? My name is Jonathan Irving. And your date of birth? 6-12-80. And your address for me, please? That's correct, and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Yes. You've mentioned you have some breathing difficulties in the notes. How can I help you? Yes, about 15 minutes ago I was gardening and I was stung by a wasp ran inside. And now I'm just starting to notice a few things. I'm having quite shallow breath. You're having difficulties breathing since then, yeah? Yes, yeah. Okay, so is there any swelling of your lips? You feel like your throat is closing up? Not throat, but I can definitely feel something in the lips, yeah. Like a tingling kind of feeling? Yes, yeah. Okay, but no swelling, yeah? I mean, to be honest, I'm just doing this to establish whether I should go to the hospital. Okay, right, okay. Have you had anything like this before? No. No, okay. So do you feel wheezy in your chest or just tightness? Yeah, a bit of tightness, yeah, a bit of tightness, yeah. A bit of tightness, okay. Okay, so I unfortunately don't have much of your past medical history. Do you have any significant past medical or surgical history you'd like to share? No, not really. A bit of eczema and I'm allergic to penicillin. Okay, are you on any regular medication at all? Not at the moment, no. Okay, right here. Fine, are you having any rash in your body at the moment? Yes, there's a bit of locking down. Locking, okay. Have you taken anything at all for the blocking? I wouldn't even know what to take now. Okay, so you've, okay, that's fine. So from what you're saying, you do need to have medical attention straight away. Okay, do you have any antihistamines in your house at all? Yes, I've used them for flying. I have aerosinocytosis, so yes, I do it somewhere. So why, and I'm, because you're breathing problem can get worse very quickly. I like you to call. Is there someone else at home with you? Yes, my wife can take me to the emergency room, yeah. I know, I wouldn't want your wife to take you. I like her to call the ambulance because that might take a bit longer and, you know, we need to deal with it quickly. So what we are worried about is, you know, in case you develop an anaphylactic reaction. Okay, she's listening, I'll get her to call now, yeah. So ask her to give you the antihistamine. In the meantime, while the ambulance is coming, and take yourself to hospital, it might just be an urticary reaction, but because you're complaining of breathing difficulties, it is quite important that you go to hospital straight away. But I'd like you to call the ambulance because, you know, so that you will be sorted out quickly. All right, thank you. She's on it now. Yeah, she's on the phone. Okay, all right, then. You take care. All right, thank you for the advice.
