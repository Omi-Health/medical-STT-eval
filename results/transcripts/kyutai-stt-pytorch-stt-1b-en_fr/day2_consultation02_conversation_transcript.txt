Hi there, good morning. I'm Dr. Dean Mesut from GPS. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Okay, before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth? Yes, my name is John Smith and I was born on the 5th of April 1930. Okay, that's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes, absolutely. Okay, great. Okay, so tell me a bit about what's been happening. You said you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow. Yeah, I just noticed this like about a week ago or something. I had like a weird swelling on my elbow. I noticed that when I was in the shower. It's not painful at all. I feel fine, but it's just a bit weird to see that. It's slightly warm. And I kind of feel like it's a bit fluid inside. Not really, no, I just, you know, sit at the desk, Yes, yes, a few years ago. Okay, was that a GP or a specialist or was it a physiotherapist? A GP, okay, all right. Rick, can I just, sorry, can I just double check how old you are, please? I'm 53. 53, okay, fantastic, all right. And do you have any other illnesses at all? Well, not really, you know, so for you, I'm allergic to peanuts. Right, okay. That's very reasonable, I have to say, but my medical... Are you allergic to any medication? No. Not that I know of. Sure. And do you, are you on any medication on a regular basis? No. No, okay. And you normally fit in well, mobile, active? I do, I do, I do some sports, I run regularly, like two, three times a week. Yeah, no, I think I'm healthy. Okay, good, good. Well done, that's good that you're doing that on a regular basis. Okay. And can I, is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now? Yes, sure. Okay, bear with me one second. Right, okay. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit, a bit higher, so I can just see the underside. Okay, fantastic. All right. And then just bring it around to this side, essentially. I can see the other side. Okay, fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers, is it hot compared to the surrounding skin that adjacent skin? It's a bit warm, yes. It's a bit warmer, okay. And is it very tender when you're pressing on that now? Do you give it a press? Does it hurt you at all? On the tip of the elbow, it's okay, just like next to it, like where the swelling is, it's a bit, yeah, it feels a bit fluid. Okay. All right. I noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow. Do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body? No, not really. I have more skin. Do you suffer from eczema at all? No. No, all right. Okay, so what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem, okay, is I think it would be worthwhile this seems like what we call the bursitis, okay, so that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. What I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication. The first instance, and as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done. To check for other types of causes of joint swelling. Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some blood test forms to be sent out to your house. And there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done. And that will involve you having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies, and so we'll do a full screen and also check things like gout as well. The time frame for that will be the results will come back to us after about five, six days. We take time for the forms to come out to you and if you get the forms of blood tests done straight away, by the time that we're expecting a result back, you know, one or two days after that, we're looking at maybe six days. And what I'd suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you. And one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood tests, and we can get a gauge as to what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now, it doesn't look like to me like something called excuse me, septic arthritis. So we are worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint. And your joint doesn't look like that. However, if the elbow was to become very red, very painful, and the retina was to spread or become, you know, more intense, then you need to get on the phone or have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible. Because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment. Okay. Do you think it's something dangerous, like something like could I die from that? Or is it? No, I don't think this is anything dangerous. You don't need to worry. Okay. What I'm doing is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop. Okay. So if things were to develop, this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward. Nothing's sinister or life threatening. What I'm doing is I'm just saying in case things worsen, these are the things that we'd be looking out for. And this is what we have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully. And I don't think you're going to have it. But I'm just saying the what if scenario. Is that okay? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me? Well, just yeah, I just wanted to know about this. Yeah, it feels a bit better now to know that at the end of that, thank you. Okay. So I would take I'm profiling regularly. Okay. You can get that over the counter. That's 400 milligrams, two times a day. And you should take that after food, not an empty stomach. If you get any heart burn, stop taking it. Okay. Sure. All right. So what I want to do is I'll get the form sent out to you. And we are going to arrange a follow up appointment, maybe within actually, you know, the follow up appointment doesn't have to be face to face. It's more convenient to do to do over the phone. We can do that with the phone. We can do that. That's your call. But you contact us after you've had the blood test done, and we can review things then. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. I'll do that. If I see that it's getting worse, I'll probably ask for it. Physical appointment. Sure. Sure. That's a good idea. All right, then. Okay. Take care, then. So just leave that with me. I'll sort all those bits and pieces out, and then we'll get them sent out to you. And then we'll review you after the test. Thank you. All right. All right. Take care. All the best. Bye bye. Bye.
