Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Yeah, I can. Can you hear me? Hi, my name is Dr. Gohill. Hi, I'm one of the physicians that works at Babylon. Are you in a quiet and private space to talk? Well, I am, yes. Good. And can I confirm your name and date of birth, please? It's Joe Blugs. It's the 7th of June. That is correct, yes. I'm experienced in discomfort in my chest. Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort when it started and how you're feeling at the moment? Sure, it's an ongoing for a couple of hours now. I'll say the discomfort is quite suddenly. I was sitting in the garden and it has described where it is. It's somewhere in the middle of my chest. And it's more, it feels more like a pressure. The discomfort is more than a pain. If I had to just describe what's happened with the discomfort feeling, it's like someone's sitting on my chest. Great, so you've talked about your chest. Are you still in discomfort at the moment? Yes, as is correct. Okay, and when it started, how would you rate it out of 10? Okay, about 87 out of 10. Okay. 10 being very sort of terrible and it's either 10, 7, it's quite manageable. Well, it's quite this old comfortable... And how about now? It's still the same. Okay, and tell me before this happened, what were you doing? I was relaxing. And we're watching Jeremy Kyle. Okay. Still got into the garden. Okay, and how often do you do gardening? Every other week, so fortnightly. Okay, and are you normally fit and well? So are you normally okay to garden as you would? Yes. Great. And apart from this, do you have any other medical problems? High cholesterol. I've had high tension, not have high tension. Okay, so that's high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Do you take any medical things for that? No, I don't take any medicine. Okay, and are you allergic to anything? Aspirin. Okay, so let me summarize what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago, and your experienced chest discomfort, which was roughly seven out of 10. Yeah. It feels more like someone sitting on your chest, as opposed to pain. Yes, that's fair. And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual, specifically with your breathing? Yes, I have. I've got the shortness of breath. I feel slightly lightheaded. Okay, and is that getting worse or better? It's remained the same, although I'll say recently I've noticed in terms of sort of breathing, I've had some difficult declines and stairs, and if I have to sort of walk uphill, there's that sort of challenge as well. And when you get shorter breath, when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain? No pain as such. But there's often calf pain and legs swellings. Okay, so let me confirm. You have the pressure at the moment, and you have shortness of breath, is that correct? That is correct, yes. So given what you've told me about your past medical history, I think it might be worse, you calling an ambulance? Okay. You get you to the hospital as soon as possible. Because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart. So. Why don't you talk to you? I will ring an ambulance who should come to your address. Right. But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone so I can gather some more information that we can give to the paramedics. Is that okay? Should I be concerned about anything? It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and you've got some chest pain, I'm always worried about the heart first before anything. Okay. And we need to look after your heart before anything else. So apart from this lightheadedness, and this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else unusual? Nothing. And have you noticed any problems going into the loo? No problems going into the loo. And you're normally fit and well apart from the two things you told me about. Yes, however, there are some problems just performing daily activities. Like I said, with the difficulty of climbing upstairs and going uphill, I tried to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house, not into stress. And do you live at home with your wife at the moment? Yes. I would suggest if she's there, you let her know that you're both having an adventure to the hospital today. So she might need to get your things together. Got it, okay. The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm and have some water if you need to. Don't take any of those medications. The paramedics should be with you very shortly. Right. So when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about. Okay. The one is your chest, so your heart. And the second is your breathing, which is your lungs. Okay. So they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms. Just to check things like for blood pressure and your heart rate. So don't be worried. Okay. And when you get to the hospital, you'll be seen by a consultant pretty much immediately. Okay. Reassuring calming things. Sure. So I will let the paramedics do their job. And when you're at the hospital, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how everything's going. Oh, that's great. Great. I'll book another appointment to see you soon. Okay. Once you've had your adventure. Thanks, Patrick. Thank you so much. No problems. Do you have any questions for me? No questions. I'll just await the answers. Great. Thank you very much. No problems. I'll speak to you soon. Thank you so much. Bye. Okay.
