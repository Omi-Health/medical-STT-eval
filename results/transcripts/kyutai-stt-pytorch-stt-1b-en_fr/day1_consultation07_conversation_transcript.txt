Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me okay? Yes. Yeah, I can. Great. But how can I help you this afternoon, sir? I am not feeling very well. And I haven't been feeling well for a good few days. No, and I'm really hoping you can do something about it because it's been bugging me for a while now. Well, I was certainly trying my best for you. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on? I just feel a bit run down. You know, I've got a cough, a cold, you know, it's been nagging me. I just, it's just all, yeah, it's just, that's it. That's it. Well, let's start with your cough first. Tell me a bit more about your cough. Is it, for example, are you coughing up anything at all? Or is it mainly dry? Yeah, yeah, mostly dry. You know, it's a wee bit. In the morning, it's a bit worse. But, you know, it's fairly, fairly dry. So you're not bringing up any mucky, phlegm, Well, it's a team called Partick Thistle, and they're in the, they're not even in the top division. shouting myself a wee bit hoarse because the performance has been pretty shite if I'm being honest with you. It sounds fascinating to wish them all the best. So you mentioned a sore throat, have you had a chance to look in the mirror, have you had a look in the back of your throat? I mean, I shaved every day, so I'm looking at myself. It's not a pretty sight, to be honest, at the best of times, but it's been a wee bit rough the last few days for sure. Yeah, I mean, have you had any, have you noticed any kind of white spots in the back of your, back of your throat or redness? Oh, right, sorry, you mean like looking, no, I don't really like to look, you know, to look at it, so I haven't, I haven't tried to do any of that. I understand, it's not pretty, as I said, it's not something we always, but moving on, in terms of your ears, any dullness or blocked ears, pain in your ears? Yeah, a wee bit, I mean, you know, I'm 50 years old now, my hearings, you know, it's not as good as it used to be, but, you know, I think, I think it's all right, it's all right. Okay, okay, fine. Moving down to your chest, how's your breathing been? So do you feel more breathless or tight in your chest? No, no, it's not. So you're breathing? No, no, no, sorry, what was that? Your breathing is fine, is it? It's not laboured or pain in your chest at all? No, no, it's weird. It's just, you know, it's just a wee bit, it's just a wee bit shortness of breath, but it's not, it's not, it's not pain, you know, as such. Okay. Have you noticed yourself, any temperatures or fevers? Feeling hot and cold, sweaty? Yeah, yeah, that's definitely something I've noticed. Like, you know, in bed with a wife, I'm having to, you know, get out and get the blank off and put it back on again. It's not, it's not, I am keeping her up at night as well, which is a bloody nightmare. But I mean, you know how these things are. Seems, seems very difficult at the moment. Have you measured your temperature at all? Have you? No, I mean, no, I mean, you know, I can, I just feel it on my forehead, but you know, use the thermometer and okay. I'm just moving on just very quickly. Any other symptoms, any nausea, any vomiting? Any tummy pain? The first, the first day I had, you know, a wee bit of what would, you know, you know, the rock, like a wee bit of diarrhea, you know, but that's, that's fine. Now, yeah, but apart from that, no. Okay. And how's your appetite? Are you eating and drinking? Okay. Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to, and I think what, what is it you starve? A cold and you feed the, I can't remember what it is, but I think I have, my appetite's been, been all right. Yeah. Yeah. Floods off as well, you know, here that's what you should do. Yeah, absolutely. Completely recommend that. So keep, keep doing what you're doing. And just lastly, you know, any, any kind of muscle pain, joint pains? Yeah, it's, it's, it's just been a, I mean, again, you know, I'm, I'm getting just a wee bit older now. So it's, it's not something that I was thinking about, but I have, I have noticed like when I, you know, when I'm bending down and, you know, moving about, it's just a wee bit stiffer than, than normal. You know, and I, I think that might be to do with whatever this thing is, but again, it's, you know, we're just getting, where do you feel the stiffness? It's just kind of like, you know, when you're, when you're bending like elbows and knees and just, just a wee bit kind of stiff, you know, all over. Okay. And just remind me, when did your symptoms all start? You say a few days ago, yeah, I would say, what day is it today? It's Wednesday. Wednesday, it's, it would have been, what is it? Saturday, because I was out. I was out having dinner and then, yeah, I came, yeah, yeah, yeah, it would have been that because I was out for my wife's, she's, she was doing this wee thing with a wee bit of celebration. So we're out for that. And I remember saying to her, I was like, you know what, I'm not feeling, great, you know, I stuck it out with her, but I, it would have been that Saturday. So what's that? About five. Five days ago. Yeah. Yeah. And you were making that might have set your symptoms off. Is it something you've eaten or have you been traveling recently abroad or? No, I haven't been, I haven't been, I mean, as I said, I was out with my wife. I don't know whether it's like, you know, the restaurant went to is like, it was like pretty good. So I wouldn't have expected them to be serving me anything dodgy or anything like that. But I don't know, you know. So not that I can see. And with that prying too much, what were you celebrating? Well, my wife has just been promoted. So she's now going to be a head teacher. Not that I'm not that I'm aware of, you know, I mean, what the allergies you get just just Patients really I'm asking not as opposed to other things Right. No, nothing. Nothing that nothing that I'm aware of not just never said no. I mean, so okay and just very briefly socially So I just want to be very important to ask you said you live with your wife anyone else at home with you No, not kids the kids have a phone the nest So just me and the missus, okay Yep, and are you working at the moment?

Do you do either? I do I do like a wee drink either dot Doctor I had he he did say I was drinking just a wee bit too much. I mean, I'm not like, you know I'm not not an alky or anything, but just just Yeah, do like a few a few pints Roughly on average. How many you drink a week? Pints well, whatever you drink is a pint beer lager wine spirits You know, maybe Maybe what with four? Four pints and like Saturday and then you know Sunday as well.

I've got a wee What are those wee things called the wee vaporizers? Okay You mentioned feeling a bit short of breath. I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but we could think about is giving you a script for antibiotics, which you maybe use the next 24 to 48 hours if your symptoms don't get better. Right. So if I just lie down and take it easy. Yeah. If I'm still on a bit rubbish, then I Right, okay, okay, so I just, plenty of rest, lots of water. Exactly. Hopefully that's going to pass.
