It's kind of like Like either like normal like it hasn't gone away it hasn't worsened Okay, and how often do you go to the toilet? I go I need to go I I can't go to work because I need to go like every I don't know if this feeling like I go to the toilet and then when I finish I need to I feel I need to go again Okay And yeah, so I need to be like close to the toilet That must be hard Yeah, yeah, you have to drink more water than normal Ah, I don't know. Maybe i'm not drinking enough water Yeah I drink I think I yeah, I don't know. I think I don't drink enough water An important question. Have you noticed any blood? No, I haven't noticed any any blood And you mentioned tummy pain. Can you tell me more about your tummy pain? Like where it is? And if it goes anywhere so The pain is mainly Focus in in the center area of that domain like under the belly under the belly bottom. Yeah Yeah, and sometimes I can hear my stomach like the crumbs Yeah, you've been able to eat and drink Yes, but yes, but I I go to the toilet so often so I I Yeah, I try not to eat a lot because I yeah, I just go into the toilet every 10 minutes And you said that the tummy pains in the middle of your tummy. Does it go anywhere else? No, no, just there and it seems to be alleviated to be Toilet and maybe it's like gas. I don't know what it is, but Okay, and when was the last time you vomited? I think it was this morning this morning. I But the thing is like because i'm not eating anything now, so I I haven't vomited again Did you have any breakfast? I I don't know I didn't no, sorry. Yes, I did actually I did hold on. I have some crumbs. I have some crumbs Okay, and that and you vomited that up afterwards And afterwards, I didn't have anything then I got a bit of nausea and I vomited and then Yeah, and that was it and that was it and I have any Depends on them. So now i'm I think i'm okay, but Yeah, and I got yeah Did you notice any blood when you vomit? I think I do I think I do but this No, no, actually, I can't say sorry. I'm sorry. I I I don't think there is blood because Yeah, it was it was a strawberries that I was having for breakfast. So so yeah, it wasn't blood. Okay, and um Did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain? uh I I don't know to be honest. Sometimes I have when I get a bit too anxiety. I I use my inhaler. Yeah But my inhaler kind of Run out the one because you know, i'm a foreigner so I have This brand that I bought a new one here. Okay and I don't know maybe this new one has caused it Okay, it's problem. I don't know Okay, it's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this Normally, it's when you eat, um bad food or food that has gone off and You normally get symptoms like you have suggested But just to double check have you noticed any problems with your breathing? I always have problems with my breathing because of the asthma like When I Make sure I need to use my inhaler a little bit but apart from the normal I haven't I haven't okay And how about chest? Have you noticed any chest pain? No, I haven't I haven't noticed any chest pain Okay, and how about um walking and talking are those all both okay? Uh walking and talking Yes Yes, uh, I but uh But yeah, I don't walk very far because I Yeah, I need to I need to go to the toilet now and then so i'm spending some time at home And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain? Oh, it does a little bit Sorry, I was just writing some things down So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain Okay, and it's normal. This is normally called gastro enteritis. So an infection of the tummy Okay, normally when patients have this Do some things Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids Because you're losing lots at the moment Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers. So if you start getting a temperature Then you need Stay home for the time being Until you get slightly better Okay, and normally, okay, I Normally things like antibiotics don't help they make the situation worse Okay, so that's Yeah, go ahead No, I was saying I didn't have any fever recently. I was sweating a little bit last for bed, but I Not sure if I had a bit of fever, but very bitter or but I don't think so. I don't think I don't know maybe So I think that what we should do for the time being if you feel you're getting much worse Then I would suggest you go and see your GP in real in real life in person So they can look at your belly Okay, I will yeah, I will book them. They will book. I will wait a couple of days to see or one per day And then I will book. Great Do you have any more questions for me? No, that's that's it I was maybe just concerned about my father's Medical history that would Yeah, some kind of risk So the the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had but if your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look up from the GP and Okay, does that sound okay? Yeah, that sounds good. That sounds good Thank you Thank you very much doctor for your time. Bye. Bye
