Hi there, good morning. Hello. I'm Dr. Dean Mizzler from GP Ham, nice to see you. Happy to meet you. Okay, so before we start your appointment, can I please confirm your full name and date of birth? My name is Tracy Chapman, and my date of birth is just tell me how old you are. I'm 45. 45, okay. Could you confirm the first line of your address and your postcode? 15, Babylon Street. Well, I've had, I've got a bit of a slight fever, and I, well, I, I coughed up a bit of blood. On, on two occasions. Right, okay. I don't know what that means. Okay, all right, we might, it might all be connected then. And, yesterday, before this, all of this, when you completely fine? Yeah, yeah, kind of. I sort of feel my heart beating, but other than that, no, sort of fine. Okay, so you can feel your heart kind of beating a bit faster? You think that normal? Is that? I don't know, I can just sort of feel it. Sure. But I've also, I've been feeling a bit, like a bit tired at work. Haven't really been, like, exercising has been a bit difficult because I've been feeling tired. Yeah, performing daily activities has been a bit harder than usual. Okay, all right. And how long has that been for, the tiredness and, you know, not wanting to exercise? Only after, only for a couple of weeks or so. Couple of weeks, okay. And then, and the last day or so, that's when you get the cough and the pain in the side, and you've coughed a lot. Okay, all right. You said you felt a bit warmer. Have you measured your temperature at all? With the lack of my hand, yeah. Yeah, just for like, for the help of that. Okay, fair enough. All right. Okay, and now, can I just ask, you smoke at all? No. Okay, what do you work as? I work in an office, just a desk job. Okay, all right. And do you live alone? Yes. Yeah, in a flat or a house? Flat. Okay, do you have any pets? Cats. A cat, okay. Are you on any medication at all, regular medication? Yeah, metatrexate, metatrexate. Metatrexate, okay. What are you on that for? I've got SLE. SLE, okay. Do you have any other diagnosis, any other answers at all? No. Right, okay. And do you have any allergies to any medication? No. Any other allergies at all? No. Okay, so you're on, you're taking metatrexate at the moment. When was the last time you had metatrexate? This morning. Oh, you had it this morning, okay. All right, all right. Okay, a couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and get an idea of how unwell you are, okay. The first thing I'd like to do is to try and measure your pulse. So the way we're going to do this is that if I can get you to try and locate the pulse in your wrist, not everyone can do this, so don't worry if you can't. But if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse, it's just under the thumb. You've got two fingers up and down like that, you might be able to feel the pulse. I've got it. You've got it, okay. Are you sure? Yeah. All right, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting, okay. So I'll just get my stopwatch up. Okay, so if you can, you've still got the pulse? Yeah. Okay, so if you can start counting, now please. One. Two. Three. Five. Six. Eight. If you can stop now, it's good. I think that was about 11 or 12. So that would make your heart rate about 66 to 74. That's okay, good. Fantastic. The next thing I'd like you to try and do, okay, it depends on the lighting, so it may not be possible, but next I'd like to try and do is just to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger, and then let me see how quickly the redness comes back. Okay, so if you can see what I'm doing now, my fingers come right behind the screen. I'm squeezing it, okay, just what we first, sorry, just what we first, yeah, I'm squeezing it, and then you can see that it goes, hey, and then it goes back to the normal red color, okay? So if I can get you just to put your finger up to your camera, and then with the other hand, just try and squeeze it, and it's No, I feel pretty normal to me. Okay. I think. All right. Now, sorry, I forgot to... Doris. Doris, okay, Doris. So Doris, what I think we need to do is this sounds like you might have a chest infection, okay? If you're coughing up blood and you're feeling your heart racing, I think you need to be examined today. Someone needs to listen to your chest. when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood, when you do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a pneumonia or chest infection. And that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope. And you may need an antibiotic. This is one thing I need to ask you. Have you been on any long haul flight recently? No, no. Okay. Have you ever had any clots in your legs or clots in your blood clots? Not that I know of, no. No, okay. Anyone in the family have that? No. No, okay. All right. What I think we'll do is we'll arrange for you to get your reviewed in a clinic today. Okay. I would like someone to listen to your chest and to check your blood pressure and to recheck your pulse as well. Just make sure and check your temperature. Make sure all those parameters are okay. You may well need an antibiotic. Okay. Do you have any allergies to any antibiotics? No. No, okay. I'm going to prescribe anything for you now because I think you need to have that basic assessment first. Well, you know, you start coughing up blood and you think you're going to die of lung cancer. Of course, yeah. So just remind me how old you are again. I'm sorry. 45. 45, okay. It's something we do need to be cognizant of, okay. And we may end up having to do a follow-up chest x-ray, things don't settle down. But at the moment, it seems more like a chest infection rather than a lung cancer. That's good to know. That is good to know, yes. Because that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are okay, because chest infections can become nasty as well. It can lead to infections out of the body. We want to avoid that as well. So let's get you checked out today, and hopefully we can put your mind to rest and get you on the right course of treatment. Perfect. Thank you very much. All right, you're welcome. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye.
