Hi there, good morning. I'm Dr. Vin Nurse. Nice to see you. So before we start your project, could I confirm your full name is Dr. Bertes? Yes, John Smith, and I am in church with two years old. Sorry, I didn't catch the break of birth. I'm 32 years old. 32 years old, okay. Could you tell me the first time you were dressed on your postcode, please? At four o'clock, having you, and it's AB1CB2. That's great. Thank you so much for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yes. Okay. So how can I help you today? You can have some problems with your accent, is that right? Sorry, say that to me. How can I help you today? So I've been experiencing very weird symptoms over the past month or so. And I just want to call things in. I have Googled it, and nothing's coming up. I thought I'd come and speak to you about it. Okay, so tell me a bit more about these weird symptoms you've been having. So it started with getting very tired. So for a couple of days, and then I get back to normal. And then I started losing feeling and feeling like I had my hands on arms. I get all these sensations like, I get the pain of the needles. Right. So what would I say? Just say that the connection is not so great. You've been getting pins and needles in the hand, is that right? Yeah, that's correct. Okay, is that the right or left hand? My right hand. Is it always the right? Yes. Okay. We've lost video now. Maybe, is there a button you can press to carry on without the video? I can't see you at the moment. Yes, that's fine. All right. So you've been having these pins and needles episodes of numbness in the right hand. Is it just the hand or does it go up the arm as well? The pins and needles are in the hand, but I feel like my arm is getting weaker. But it only lasts three days, and then goes back to normal. So it's very weird. Right. Okay. Is there any involvement of your leg at all? My colleague said I'm walking slightly differently to normal. And again, it's only for three days or three or four days. Okay. You said you've been having weird symptoms for about a month. Yes. So what has been happening from the beginning of the month? What else has been happening? I generally feel tired and weak. And sometimes I feel nauseous and I don't feel like I want to do anything. Right. Okay. And I There have been getting more regular, so at the start it would be maybe once a week, to every once a month, but now it's getting a couple of times a day. Right, okay. And how long have these episodes been going on for? When did it all start? Roughly a month and a half, maybe two months. Right, okay. And how long would these symptoms of the weakness and numbness, do you have any other symptoms at the same time? Like swallowing or difficulty speaking or vision problems? So recently I've noticed I can't hold my cup of coffee. And when I do drink coffee, it's slightly harder to drink. And that's only been in the last couple of days, I guess. Right, is that during these episodes or outside of these episodes? Only during the episodes. Okay. Do you have any difficulty swallowing it for? Not currently, no. During the episodes, do you have any difficulty swallowing? I feel like there's something in my throat. Okay, what about difficulty speaking during these episodes? Any issues with that at all? No, I can speak by... Okay, and any visual problems during these episodes? I don't think so, but I wear glasses. Okay, all right. Now, can I just ask, is there any history of stroke or mini strokes in your family? Yes, my father has had a operation to the side of his neck. I take an aspirin, 75 milligrams once a day, but that's because of something I read on the internet. Okay, so why is that? Why do you take that? I think it's meant to reduce your risk of stroke and heart attack. Okay, have you ever told a doctor before you're a GP that you're on aspirin? Yes, I started taking it after my father had his operation, but that wasn't the doctor telling me. Okay, and has any GP ever spoken to you about the risks of aspirin and whether you should be on it or have you not told the GP in the past? No, I haven't. Okay, all right, now in terms of your kind of social situation, are you working at the moment? Yes, I am. What do you work as? I'm actually a doctor. You're a medical doctor? Yes. Okay, which specialty are you in? I work in plastic surgery. Plastic surgery, okay, great. And do you have any allergies to any medication at all? I'm allergic to penicillin only. Okay, and are you living alone? No, I live with my wife. Right, okay. Fantastic. Do you smoke at all? No, I don't. Right, okay. That's fine. Now, obviously you're a medic yourself. Did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on? I've absolutely got no idea. Right, okay. Well, the way you're describing these episodes, they make me concerned about mini strokes or TIA, transient ischemic attacks. And so that's something quite urgent. And given that you've got a family history of stroke, even though you're quite young, I think it's something that we need to exclude. So what I'm probably going to do, in fact, what I am going to do is I'm going to refer you to a stroke, a TIA clinic. Now, just to double check, do you have the symptoms right now? No, I'm perfectly fine at the moment. Okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to refer you to a mini stroke clinic or a TIA clinic. I send that referral off now, and then you can attend them. Usually call you in within the next one or two days. Okay, because it's something relatively urgent. Now, today it's Wednesday, so we've got a few days to call the weekend. So basically the deadline should be Thursday, Friday. We're expecting to be seen by that time. That's the kind of turnaround we're looking at. And in that clinic, they'll be doing a number of things. They'll be checking, they'll be doing the ultrasound of the carotid artery like your father had. And they'll be doing maybe they might do a scan of the brain as well to show that there's any signs of a bleed there. But they'll be doing a range of tests in a short time frame in order to exclude whether you have any illness. You haven't got any kind of stroke or mini stroke. Now, if your symptoms return and they persist, they're prolonged, then you may need to attend A&E. Okay, because I presumptive working diagnosis is mini stroke or TIA. Okay, and if a mini stroke is prolonged, then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke. And in that case, that becomes even more of an emergency. So we're not talking about waiting one or two days. We want you to go to hospital in that instance. No, I think that covers most of it. Okay, great. So just bear with me a few minutes and then I'll send that all through and then you should, you should be able to have, yes, you have the information at your hands in order to get things further, okay? Great, thank you. All the best, take care then, bye bye. Bye
