Hello. Hi. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, I can hear you. Right, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Sure. I'm Amanda Jackson and I'm nineteen years old. nineteen years old. Okay, Amanda, and how can I help you this afternoon? So it's been going on for a few days now. It's not happened before and I'm a bit worried. It hurts when I kind of pee. And yeah, it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more. And it's really like I can't go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. Oh dear. And it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in the bottom of my tummy as well. Right. OK. I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you. So you mentioned you've been going for the last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. You're going to the toilet more often as well, is that right? Yeah, it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days, I think actually. Maybe just under a week. Oh, under a week, sorry. Okay. Sorry, no, I didn't explain it properly before. Yeah, no, I, it's been going on for about just under a week. And yeah, I noticed sort of burning, stinging when I go to the toilet. Yeah. Have you noticed anything in your urine, for example, any blood or discoloration of urine? I think, well, today I noticed that it was like a bit pink, the urine. Okay. Yeah. I think just today. Have you noticed any kind of frank blood, any red blood at all in your urine? I think it was thin probably. I don't know, it was pink, so. Okay, fine, we'll definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on. You also mentioned some tummy pain as well. Can you tell me a bit more about that pain? Yeah, it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy, mainly when I go to the loo. I think that's when it's worse. Okay. Can you describe as a crampy pain, as a more of a burning pain? I wouldn't describe as crampy. I don't think it's like a period pain. It's a bit different. It's hard to say an achy pain, I suppose. Achy pain. Okay. Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back, towards your sides? No, no. Okay. All right. Any other symptoms at all? For example, nausea, vomiting? No. No nausea, vomiting. Okay, any temperatures or fevers? No, no, not that I've noticed. Okay, all right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working okay? I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any different. Okay, and what it usually is. When you say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have? I think I have IBS. So I just kind of pass my bowels like quite a lot. And sometimes it's quite variable, like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit it's sorry, this is a bit disgusting, but like sometimes it's a bit harder and hard to predict. Okay, all right. But you've noticed no new symptoms in your bowels. No, no, not that. Okay, all right. And Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions as you can imagine. Can I ask, are you currently sexually active at the moment? Yeah, I have a long term boyfriend. Okay, and have you noticed any other discharge from down below so from the front passage? No, I don't think so. Nothing unusual. Okay, do you use any form of contraception? Yeah, I'm on the pill. The pill? What kind of pill is it? Is it a combined pill or the mini pill? A combined pill. Okay, fine. When was the last time you had unprotected sex? If you don't want me asking that. I mean, unprotected is in like no condoms or anything. Yeah, exactly. I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend. It's like, I don't know, we've just kind of agreed. So I guess a week ago. Two weeks ago. Okay, all right. What I'm trying to get at is whether there's any chance you'll be pregnant at all. I know you're on the pill, but nonetheless we do have to ask. When was your last period? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, okay, all right. Just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better, okay? Fine. In terms of your general health otherwise at the moment, are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, yeah, eating and drinking okay. I did have one kind of concern. I don't know So I smoked, this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time, like a week and a half ago. I just wondered whether it's related at all, probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. Sure. Well, thanks for sharing with me. So I don't think it is related to your symptoms. I think it's probably just a pure coincidence, but I do strongly advise you to make it a regular habit if you can, just for your general health moving forward. Okay. Fine. Moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions apart from the IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of? No. No. Okay, great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the combined pill? Apart from the pill, I take something for the IBS as well. It begins with an M. It's really hard to pronounce, like mehbeh something. Maybe. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Okay, and then that's the cramps, the crampy pain. Yeah, yeah, thank you. And do you have any allergies to any medications? Yeah, I think there was an antibiotic called Clindamycin. Clindamycin. Okay, okay. That took like a couple years ago something and yeah, that didn't go too well. Right, okay, sure. I'll make a note of that. In terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? No. No problem with anything else. Good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? So I am living in Halls at the moment, uni. So I'm just living with a flatmate, I suppose. But my family live kind of outside of London, not too far away. So yeah, my family are fine and I see them now and then. Very good. Yeah, things are okay generally. Great and what are you studying at university? I'm studying English. English, okay, good. And how are you enjoying your course? Yeah, yeah, it's going well. Thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago. Yeah, I really enjoy it. Very good. In terms of smoking and alcohol, do you participate in either? As I admitted before, I tried weed for the first time, but I don't smoke. I drink occasionally, kind of socially with friends. Okay, and what made you have your first joint last week? It that? It was just a party. There were other people doing it. I kind of was a little bit tipsy. Probably wasn't thinking quite straight. But yeah, I completely agree. It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure. And obviously, your doctor has something to look after you. So I would strongly recommend you to avoid it. Great. Fine. So at this age, I wouldn't normally examine you. But I think based on your story, I think I'm reassured by the fact that I think it's probably just a simple what we say, UTI or cystitis bladder infection. You haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about. So things like fevers and back pain would be more worrying for me to hear. So some of these we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. So we've got choice of two antibiotics, something called trimethoperin or nitrofurantoin, which is a three day course. Normally they're usually quite effective for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well if you can so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there. Start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids. If you are having some pain, simple paracetamol would probably be advisable. We'll see what the urine sample shows. And if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. But if things are still not getting better next week, come back and see me. And we can have another look again. Okay, great. With the urine sample, how do I go about doing that? Well, good question. So I will give you, I will organize for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices, which we can test there and then with a urine date and send it off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results. Okay, perfect. Okay, great. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call, okay? Fever, back pain, vomiting, great. Okay, yeah. Okay, have a good day. Okay. Thank you. You too. Have a good day. Bye.
