And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Yes. Okay, so you mentioned in our notes that you've got skin problem. If you can tell me a bit more about it please. Yes, over the past few days I had noticed my skin is sore and red. Okay, so where is it sore and red? It's all over my chest, my hands and arms, especially inside of the elbows. Where are the elbows? You can touch that. On the inside of the elbows. Of course, okay, inside of the elbows, yeah. Which is the worst area. All right, the worst area. Is it very itchy? It's very itchy and dry all over my body. Itchy and dry. Okay. Have you had something like this in the past? Yes, yes I have it. I had eczema in the past. Okay, do you think this is similar to your usual eczema or is it worse? I think it's gotten worse like these past few days. Yeah, but it could be like something similar. So on your skin is there any, you know, any of the patches, sore areas, you mentioned it's quite sore. Is it weeping? Is it like watery liquid coming from that area? Weeping? No. Nothing that you notice. Okay, right. But some of the areas are cracked. Yeah, so you have cracks over there, okay. And is there any scratch marks on your on any of the, you know, areas? Any scratch marks? I mean, it's very itchy to scratch myself with no scratch marks. Okay, is there any thickened skin? Like, you know, where it's the skin's very thick and darkened areas? No, no, I don't think so. Okay, right here. So you've mentioned you've got a history of eczema, so what do you do about it? How do you keep it under control? Yeah, usually I use a cream called Deprobase. In the shower I use something called Thermal. Thermal, all right. And have you been using them recently or not? Yes, yes, I use them. You use them every day? Yes, there's no change in that. I didn't change any of them. Okay, have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema? I'm not sure. Yes, yes. You've used steroids? No, I've used it. But it's not helping. Yeah, also, you're still using the steroids. Yeah, I tried. I tried. Which one are you using the steroids? What's the name? I'm not sure. Is it the over the counter? The bumps is not there. Okay, so is it like the over the counter ones? Sorry. Over the counter, hydrocortisone. Does that ring out? Yeah, so you're using the hydrocortisone. Are you using any antihistamines at all? No. No, no antihistamines. Okay. Right. Fine. Otherwise, other than this rash, you're feeling well in yourself, there's no temperature, no joint pains, yeah? No joint pain. I realized that I've tried also antihistamines and didn't work. You've tried the antihistamines and didn't work. Okay, which one did you try? The one over the counter. Okay, so like said Trisin, yeah? Yeah, okay, that's fine. Right, okay, so from what you're describing, it looks like, you know, it is quite widespread your eczema, yeah? Because you're having it all over your chest and hands and things like that. So do you have any allergies to any medication at all? No, no allergies. No allergies. Okay. And you don't, other than eczema, you don't have any other medical condition? I have asthma and in my family there is hypothyroidism and migraine. My mother has migraine. Mother has migraine and what was the other one I didn't understand. Hypothyroidism. Who has hypothyroidism? My mother. Okay, so she has hypothyroidism. Okay, that's fine. Right here, you mentioned you have asthma. So what medications are you using for asthma? Probably inhaler. The blue inhaler, so you don't use it every day, so you just use it on and off, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Blue inhalers, but your breathing's all okay, yeah? Okay, yeah, yeah, it's only when I have a flare. Sure. So what we need to do is obviously you've got extensive, as I've mentioned, so extensive eczema. What we'll do, you need a couple of things because to keep you a bit comfortable, you would probably need some histamines, which I'm going to prescribe. Also, hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you use for young children. You might probably need a bit more stronger one like betna weight or something like that. Okay, so we'll try that first. So I'm going to give it's called the antihistamine is called hexaphenidine and then we will try with some betna weight first. So it's like very small amount, like it's like one fingertip. Yeah, this much is enough to cover your palms and back of your hands. So it's a very small amount. So that if you can imagine, you can cover with a very small amount the whole body. So use that. You have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks. Okay. If there's no improvement, you need to get back to us. Or if you have any kind of adverse reaction, like an allergic reaction which is unlikely but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us. Okay? Okay, thank you very much. So what we're going to do is we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy. It looks like boots on the systems. Is that correct? Yeah? Yes. Yes, so I'll send it across to boots and it won't be there for collecting. If things are getting worse in the next two weeks, call us beforehand. Otherwise, wait for two weeks, take the medication and the cream. You still need to continue on your emollients like the dermal soap and as well as the diprovate. Yeah, so you still need to use those in the interim. Any questions at all? No, no questions. Thank you very much. You take care then. Bye bye now. Bye.
