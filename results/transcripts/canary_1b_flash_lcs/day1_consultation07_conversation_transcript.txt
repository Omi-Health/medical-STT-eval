Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me okay? Yes, yeah I can. Great. How can I help you this afternoon sir? I am not feeling very well. I'm sorry. And I haven't been feeling well for a good few days now and I'm really hoping you can do something about it because it's been bugging me for a while now. Well I will certainly try my best for you. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on? I just feel a bit run down. I've got a cough, a cold, you know, my mouth's been nagging me. I just it's just all yeah. That's it. Well, let's start with your cough first. Tell me a bit more about your cough. Is it, for example, are you coughing up anything at all or is it mainly dry? Yeah, yeah. I mean, mostly dry. You know, it's a wee bit in the morning, it's a bit worse. But, you know, it's fairly dry. So you don't bring up any mucky phlegm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not something I'd talk about, but about, but yeah, it's either. Yeah, I can certainly hear you've got the sniffles, so you've got a bit of a runny nose you mentioned. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. Is that coming through loud and clear on the phone? Yeah, yeah. So it's here though. Yeah, there's definitely a problem. And any other symptoms, for example, have you had any sore throats, any ear pain? Yeah, yeah, I've had a bit of a sore throat. I mean, you know, I'm doing a lot of, you know, watching the football as well. So I do a lot of shouting at that, but I'm not sure if that's related or not. Okay. Who do you support? Well, it's a team called Partik Thistle and they're not even in the top division of the Scottish league. They're actually in the championship, which is the league below that and they're bottom of the table. Right. So I've been shouting myself a wee bit hoarse because the performance has been pretty shy if I'm being honest with you. Well, sounds fascinating. Well, I wish them all the best. Yeah. Yeah. The table. So you mentioned a sore throat. Have you had a chance to look in the mirror? Have you had a look at the back of your throat? I mean, I shave every day, so I'm looking at myself. It's not a pretty sight, to be honest, at the best of times, but it's been a wee bit rough the last few days for sure. Yeah, I mean, have you noticed any kind of white spots in the back of your back of your throat or redness? All right, I mean, looking. No, I don't really like to look at it, so I haven't tried to do any of that. I understand, it's not pretty, as I say a lot, it's not something we always recommend, but moving on, in terms of your ears, any dullness or blocked ears, pain in your ears? Yeah, a wee bit. I mean, you know, I'm fifty years old now, my hearing's, you know, it's not as good as it used to be, but you know, I think it's all right, it's all right. Okay, okay. Fine. Moving down to your chest, how's your breathing been? Do you feel more breathless or tight in your chest? No, no, it's not. So you're breathing out? No, no, no, no. Sorry, what was that? Your breathing is fine, is it? Is it, is it, is it not labored or? No, it's, it's not, it's not good. It's not good? No, no, no, no. Okay, okay, so you're feeling more short of breath? Yeah, Okay, okay. Any pain in your chest at all? No, it's weird. It's just a wee bit shortness of breath, but it's not pain as such. Okay, have you noticed yourself any temperatures or fevers? Feeling hot and cold, sweaty? Yeah, yeah, that's definitely something I've noticed. Like, you know, in bed with a wife, I'm having to, you know, get out and get the blanket off and put it back on again. It's not, it's not pleasant. I mean, I'm keeping her up at night as well, which is a nightmare, but I mean, you know how these things are. Seems very difficult at the moment. Have you measured your temperature at all? Have you got a No, I mean, I mean, I can, I just feel it on my forehead, but I haven't, you know, used a thermometer or anything. Cool. Okay. And just moving on just very quickly, any other symptoms, any nausea, any vomiting, any tummy pain? The first, the first day I had, you know, a wee bit of, you know, the rot, like a wee bit of diarrhea, you know, but that's fine now. And yeah, but apart from that, no. Okay. And how's your appetite? Are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to, you know, I think what is it? You starve a cold and you feed the I can't remember what it is, but I think my appetite's been been all right. Yeah. Yeah. I'm trying to keep your floods up as well. You know, here that's what you should do. Yeah, absolutely. Completely recommend that to keep doing what you're doing. And just lastly, you know, any kind of muscle pain, joint pains? Yeah, it's just been a week. I mean, again, you know, I'm getting just a wee bit older now. So it's not something that I was thinking about, but I have noticed like when I'm bending down and moving about, it's just a wee bit stiffer than normal. And I think that might be to do whatever this thing is, but again, it's just getting on Where do you feel the stiffness? It's just kind of like when you're bending elbows and knees and just a wee bit kind of stiff, you know? All over. Okay. And just remind me, Sarah, when did your symptoms all start? You say a few days ago? Yeah, I would say what day is it today? It's Wednesday. Wednesday, so it would have been, was it Saturday, because I was out. I was out having dinner and then yeah, I came, yeah, yeah, yeah, it would have been that because I was out for my wife's, she was doing this weekend with a bit of a celebration. So we're out for that. And I remember sending her, I was like, you know what? I'm not feeling great. You know, I stuck it out with her, but it would have been that Saturday. So what's that book? Five, four, five days ago? Yeah. Okay. Are you aware of anything that might have set your symptoms off? Is it something you've eaten or have you been traveling recently abroad? No, I haven't been, I mean, as I said, I was out with my wife. I don't know whether it's like, you know, the restaurant we went to was like, it was like pretty good, so I wouldn't have expected them to be serving me anything dodgy or anything like that, but I don't know, you know. Okay. So, not even that I can see. And without prying too much, what were you celebrating? Well, my wife has just been promoted, so she's now going to be a head teacher of primary school. So just in contact with her. Yeah, we knight in the tiles for that. So, yeah, yeah. Well, good, excellent. So just moving on, sir, regarding your, what we say, past medical history, do you have any other medical problems that should be aware of? So anything to do with your heart, lungs? I'm a wee bit on the chunky side, you know. I've got a wee bit a wee bit around the midriff. The spare tire is definitely there. And I've got the diabetes. Diabetes, right? What type of diet is it type one or type two? It's type two. Type one. Aye, aye. Because he said the other guy I spoke to was sort of saying like, you know, as a bigger guy, it's kind of like, yeah. Yeah, okay. And when I was speaking to, it was this, it was another doctor I spoke to a while ago, but when he took the, when he was telling me this as well, he took my blood pressure and that he said that was high, higher than it should be. You've been diagnosed with high blood pressure or was that just a wonderful one? Okay, all right. So moving on in terms of your medications, which medications do you take on a regular basis? Give me, I'm just going to check, it's, let me know if I'm pronouncing this correctly because I haven't got my glasses with me. So it's methylormine. That's correct, okay. And there's another one, Lisinopril. Lisinopril, yeah. I think that's those two. I've got them written down with the papers, so. No problems, no problem. Anything else, sir? No, just those two. I mean, a wee bit, like, you know, a wee bit of aspirin or whatever every now and again, but nothing long term. Okay, all right. And just moving on swiftly, sir. Do you have any allergies at all? Not that I'm aware of. I mean, what the allergies you get just Just allergies really, I'm asking as opposed to other things. Right, nothing that I'm aware of. Doctors never said anything to me. Okay. And just very briefly, socially, sir, just one of is very important to ask, you said you live with your wife, anyone else at home with you? No, not kids, the kids have they've formed the nest, so just me and the misses. Okay, yeah. Good luck. Yep, and are you working at the moment yourself? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you do? Well, it's one of the, there's a wee factory just down the road, so we just, you know, we just manufacture like, uh, like kind of steel parts, things like that, you know. So it's a good wee job. It keeps us, the roof over us. Pays the bills, yeah, really. Yeah, exactly. What about smoking and alcohol, sir? Do you either? I do, I do like a wee drink. The old doctor I had, he did say I was drinking just a wee bit too much. I mean, I'm not like, you know, not an alchie or anything, but just, yeah, do like a few pints right now and again. Roughly on average, how many you drink a week? Pints. Well, whatever you drink, is it pine, beer, lager, wine, spirits. Yeah, maybe what? Like four pints on like a Saturday and then, you know, Sunday as well. Maybe like nine pints in a week, I would say. Okay. Okay. And what about smoking, sir? Every now and again, but I'm trying to cut that down. I've got a wee what are those wee things called? The wee vaporizers. Oh, okay. Yeah, I've got myself one of those. So I've been cutting down on the cigarettes and I just got this wee thing. It's great. It's actually amazing. I wish you all the best in your journey to quit. I highly recommend it if you can. It will certainly help your health as well. So just to summarize, I think, you know, based on your story, I'm not worried. I think, you know, what you essentially have is a bit of a viral illness, perhaps, a bit of maybe early signs of a flu, which I think should settle down really on his own over time. Things to, you know, you can do to help yourself, you know, stay rested, drink plenty of fluids. If you are, if you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular paracetamol would be beneficial. You mentioned you're feeling a bit short of breath. I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but what we could think about is giving you a script for antibiotics which you maybe use in the next twenty four to forty hours if your symptoms don't get better. Right, so if I just lie down and take it easy. if I'm still running a bit rubbish, then I'll give you a script today, give it about twenty four to forty hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and run down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like amoxicillin, one tablet three times a day. And if you're still not better by next week, come back and see me and we can have another look. All right, okay, okay, so I just plenty of rest, lots of water. Exactly. Hopefully that pass. Yes, absolutely. All right, that is perfect. That's just what I wanted to hear. Great. Well, I'm glad I could help. And I wish you and your football team all the best. I hope so, I hope so. It's not looking too good, but I Thank you. Cheers. All the best. Bye bye.
