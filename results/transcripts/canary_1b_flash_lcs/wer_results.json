      "reference_text": "Hi there. Good morning. I'm Doctor from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. Hi. OK. So, um, before we start your appointment. Could I confirm your full name and date of birth please? Yeah, it's John Smith, and I am thirty two years old. Sorry, I didn't catch your date of birth. I'm thirty two years old. Thirty two years old, OK. Could you tell me the first line of your address, and your postcode please? It's four Park Avenue, and it's AB one CB two. That's great, thank you so much for that. Are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment? Yes. OK. So how can I help you today? You've been having some problems with your asthma. Is that right? Sorry, say that . How can I help you today? So, um, I've been experiencing very weird symptoms, over the past month or so. And I don't know what's causing them. I have googled it and, um, nothing's coming up, so I thought I'd come and speak to you about it. OK. OK. So, tell me a bit more about these weird symptoms you've been having. So, it started with, feeling very tired, but for a couple of days, and then I get back to normal. And then I started losing feeling, in my hands and arms. I get a weird sensation like, uh, I guess, pins and needles. Right again, the connection's not so great. You've been getting pins and needles in the hand. Is that right? And. Yeah, that's correct. OK. Is that the right or left hand? My right hand. Is it always the right? Yes. OK. Um, we've lost video now, maybe is there a, a, a button you can press? OK. Are you happy for us to carry on without the video? I can't see you at the moment. Yes, that's fine. All right. Um, so, you've been having these pins and needles, and episodes of numbness, in the right hand. Is it just the hand, or does it go up the arm as well? Uh, the pins and needles are in the hand, but I feel like my arm is getting weaker, but it only lasts few days and then goes back to normal. So, it's very weird. Right, OK. Um, is there any involvement of your leg at all? Uh, my, colleague said, I'm walking slightly differently to normal. And again, it's only for three days, or three or four days. OK. You, you said you've been having weird symptoms for about a month. Yes. , so, what has been happening from the beginning of the month? What else has been happening? Um, I generally feel tired, and weak. And, sometimes I feel nauseous, and I don't feel like I want to do anything. Right, OK. Um, and, um. You know, , your colleague said you've, you've not been walking normally. Yes. Do you feel anything different, on either side, in terms of your legs? Can , have you noticed anything different? Yeah, so, at the same time I get my arm symptoms, my leg feels weaker. Right, OK. And. You know you, the abnormal gait. Has that been present, outside of these episodes? No, it has not. So normally, I'm, fit and well actually. Right, . All right, OK. Um, and, these, these episodes. How often have they been happening? They have been getting more regular. So at the start, it would be maybe once a week, uh, to every once , once a month, but now it's getting uh, uh, a couple of times a day. Right, OK. And, how long have these episodes been going on for? When, when did it all start? Was it a month ago? , probably a month and a half, maybe two months. Right, OK. OK. And, along with these symptoms, of the weakness and numbness. Do you have any other symptoms at the same time? Like swallowing, or difficulty speaking, or vision problems? So, recently I've noticed, I can't hold my cup of coffee. And when I, do drink coffee, it's slightly harder to drink. And that's only been in the last couple of days, I guess. Right. Is that during these episodes, or outside of these episodes? Only during the episodes. OK. Do you have any difficulty swallowing at all? Not currently, no. . During the episodes, do you have any difficulty swallowing? I, I, I feel like there's something in my throat. OK. What about, um, difficulty speaking during these episodes? Any, any issues with that at all? No, I can speak fine. OK. And any visual problems during these episodes? I, I don't think so, but I wear glasses. OK, all right. Now um, can I just ask? , has, uh, is there any history of stroke, or mini-strokes in your family? Uh, yes. My, father has had a, operation to the side of his neck, to reduce the risk of stroke. Right, OK. Um, and, uh, how about yourself? Have you had any history of, mini-strokes or anything like that, along those lines? I know you're quite young. No, so after my, dad had his operation, I was required to be checked, and my cholesterol , was fine. Good, excellent. So you had a, a blood test done. And did they check for diabetes as well? Yeah. They checked my diabetes, my blood pressure and my, cholesterol, and the doctor said it was all OK. Fantastic, OK. Now, do you have any other illnesses at all? No. No. Are you on any medication? I take an aspirin, seventy five milligrams, once a day, but that's, because of something I read on the internet. OK. So, so, why is that? Why do you take that? I think it's, meant to reduce your risk of stroke and heart attack. OK. Do, have you ever told a doctor before, your GP, that you're on Aspirin? Yes I took, I started to , taking it after my, father had his operation, but that wasn't the doctor telling me. OK. Uh, and, has any GP ever spoken to you about, the risks of Aspirin, and whether you should be on it? Or have you not , told the , the GP in the past? No, I haven't. You haven't, OK. Um, all right. Um. Now, um, in terms of your uh, your kind of social situation. Um, are you working at the moment? Yes, I am. , what do you work as? Uh, I'm, uh, I'm actually a doctor. You're a , a, a medical doctor? Yes. OK. Uh, which, specialty are you in? I work in, uh, plastic surgery. Plastic surgery, OK, great. And, um, do you, have any, um, allergies to any medication at all? I'm allergic to penicillin only. OK. And, um, are you, um, living alone? No, I live with my wife. Right, OK. Um, fantastic. Uh , do you smoke at all? No, I don't. Right, OK. Um, that's fine. Now, obviously you're a, you're a medic yourself. Did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on? Uh, I've actually, got no idea. Right, OK. Um, well the, the way you're describing these episodes. They make me concerned about, mini-strokes or TIAs, , transient ischemic attacks. Um. OK. And so, that's something quite urgent. And given that you've got a family history of um, stroke. Um, even though you're quite young, I think um, it's something that we need to exclude. So, what I'm probably going to do, uh, in fact what I am going to do, is I'm going to, refer you to a stroke, a TIA clinic. Um, now just to double-check. Do you have the symptoms right now? No, I'm perfectly fine at the moment. OK. So, so, what I'm gonna do, is I'm uh, I'm gonna refer you to a, a mini-stroke clinic, or a TIA clinic. Um, I send that referral off now, and then you can attend them, they, they'll usually, call you in within the next one to two days, OK. Because it's something relatively urgent. Now, today it's Wednesday, so we've got a few days , before the weekend. So, um, uh, basically the deadline should be, Thursday, Friday. We're expecting you to be seen by the time, that's the kind of turnaround we're, we're looking at. And in that clinic, they'll be doing a number of things. Um, they'll be checking, they'll be doing a ultrasound of the, carotid arteries, like your, your father had. Um, and, they'll be doing a, maybe a, they might do a scan of your brain as well, to check if there's any signs of a bleed there. But, um, they'll be doing a range of tests in a short time frame, in order to exclude whether, you have um, any illness. OK, whether you have got any kind of stroke or, mini-stroke. Sure. Now, if your symptoms return and they persist, they're prolonged. Then um, you may need to attend A and E. OK, because um, our presumptive, working diagnosis is, mini-stroke or TIA, OK. And if, a mini-stroke is prolonged then uh, then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke and in that case, that becomes even more of an emergency. So, we're not talking about waiting one or two days, we want you to go to hospital in that instance, as soon as possible, OK. Sure. Now if , things happen again, feel free to contact us, we can assess you over the phone, we can give you direction and guidance over the phone. That's, that's, that's not a problem, you know, you, you've got easy access to us. OK. So, um, this is the plan going forward. Um, I'm going to, um, do that referral. You should hear back from the hospital, relatively soon. The hospital, you can actually ring them, on um, uh, the PALS number, and then there's also the TIA clinic number. I'm going to leave that number in the notes for this consultation, OK. So you'll have all the information you need, to chase this appointment. OK. And um, if you want, you can ring them, either today or tomorrow morning. , today in the afternoon, wait uh, one or two hours. Or tomorrow morning just to find out when they got time to slot you in. And, just to make sure they've got you in the system, that they've got in the books, and they're going to be calling you in, OK. , this isn't, a, an immediate emergency that you need to rush down to A and E. But it's something quite urgent we need to, deal with in a short space of time, OK. So if there's, if there's any delay that, transpires for example, you can't make the appointment or, you know, they, you don't get called. , you, you get, get in contact back, back with us, OK. All right. Did you have any questions at all? No, I think that covers, most of it. OK, great. So just bear with me a few minutes, and then I'll send that uh, all through and then you should, um, you should be able to help, you should have the information at your hands to, in order to take things further, OK. , thank you. All the best. Take care now. Bye bye.",

And then I have like, a hayfever, you know, and some allergies just to dust, stuff like that. , OK. You have any, inhalers? Or any, any medications? Um, yeah, so, uh, you know the um, uh, Ventolin. It's called uh, Salbutamol. Yeah. I got that one, and then I have a steroid, a Clenil, Clenil inhaler. Clenil, Clenil Modulite, yeah, OK. Yeah, yeah. And um, uh, have you been using Clenil and the Ventolin? And how often have you been using them? Um, well to be honest, I was away at uni last week, and I forgot to bring it with me, so I haven't really in the past week. Uh. Both of them? Because , because um, sorry, they ran out and I, I forgot to, go and grab the next one. Yeah, sure. About a week ago. Yeah. OK. All right, all right. So, so, so you've, you haven't got any Clenil, or any Ventolin at the moment? Not with me right now, no, I ran out. OK. All right. Um, and , any drug allergies, that you know of? No, no, not allergic to anything. Just like, just the, dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs. OK, great. Now, uh, do you, anyone in your family have any medical problems, that you know of? Um, yeah, my mum has eczema, and my dad has asthma. , ohh, when I was young, I also had eczema. And I had a milk protein allergy, when I was young too. Hmm. OK. Um. Right. So, just uh, , do you have any other, sort of concerns? Or ideas about what might be going on? Or, um, hopes for this consultation? Um. Not really, like I feel like asthma's probably a part of it, and, probably getting my, inhalers would be helpful Um. It's just kinda scary, 'cause I haven't had, a time like this where I've been so, tight, uh, in a long time. Yeah, absolutely, I can, I can imagine. Um, well, it certainly sounds like uh, you've, you've had this cold, so you've got wheezy with a cough. Um, and it's non-productive cough, and you're short of breath. Uh, is the cough worse at night-time? I mean, it gets a little bit worse at night but, basically, just pretty consistent, and it hasn't gone away. Yeah. OK. And you've got this tight, tight chest. But you, you wouldn't say you've got chest pains? It's more of a tight chest, is it? No, not really pain, it's more like, tight. It just feels like sometimes, I can't get a full breath in, you know. Yeah, sure. Um, OK. Well, I, I would quite like to, uh, certainly get you some, uh, Ventolin, Clenil Modulite. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit, more like, back in high school. Um, but, I've been pretty good at taking my , my inhalers, so, not, not so much any more. Yeah. Have you ever been to hospital, uh, as an inpatient? As in, you know, stayed in there overnight, for asthma? Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat. Ohh, OK. So you, so, so you, uh, you , you went to hospital, and had a, a, . So you stayed in hospital for a few days did you, with an asthma exacerbation? Yeah I did, yeah. OK, but currently you're just on Ventolin and Clenil? And you haven't got any of those steroids, uh, those inhalers at the moment? Yeah, I'm doing pretty good, I'm doing pretty good, just on the Clenil, and the Salbutamol. OK. When, sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation? Uh, I think I was like seventeen. Sixteen maybe. Sure. OK. Um. Just to quantify how short of breath you are, um, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you? No, you won't have will you. No, no. Um, are you able to, uh, like walk up, flights of stairs OK? Walk on the flat OK, without getting to short of breath? Or um, are you short of breath at rest? Uh, I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like, except for that feeling I was describing. It does when I'm walking up stairs, I do feel like, I have a little bit, more short of breath than I would normally be. Sure. Yeah. OK, but you're not short of breath at rest at the moment? No, no, no I'm not. OK, fine. So, what, what I think, um, and just to, just to go over, . Is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the uh, a, prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else you'd hoped about getting from this? Well I just wanna know that I'm OK, to just like keep. I just don't wanna have to get, um, that, that intubation again. Sure, yeah, no, absolutely. Well, I'm really glad you have talked to me today. I think what we can do is, is give you a prescription for, uh, some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you, within the hour, I would hope. Uh, . Um, and, uh, I think, what, the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a, dose of steroids. So this is, these are tablets which, um, you can take for five days. Uh, two tablets in the morning. And, uh, that should just dampen down your asthmatic response, OK. OK. Um, now there are some side effects to the steroids. Which I should really tell you about, but please read the label, that's associated with. Don't be too worried about the side effects. They're , most, you know , most of the time the steroids are, very well tolerated. And, uh, you . Have you had them in the past, do you know of? Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? . Have you had steroids in the past? Um, I can't remember, probably. I think so. Probably, yeah I would too. So, um, they, they can come, they can make you, your mood change, can be slightly low or too, slightly high. Can give you, a high blood sugar, um, and, uh, their. Uh, , they can also cause rash, nausea, um, headaches, but, mostly is well-tolerated, and it should help your asthma an awful lot. Um, uh, what I'd like to do is, is send you these, the, some prescriptions for your, uh, inhalers, , ongoing. So you, um, you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can, you can, use the Clenil Modulite in the morning, with Ventolin as a PRN. , so, a Ventolin when you need to, um, when you're getting wheezy. OK. OK. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than, uh, every three hours. Uh, at, at anytime, it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So, um, see a doctor, um, in some capacity. Yeah. Uh, and, the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually, go into your lungs better. Have you, do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before? Yeah, yeah, I, somebody told me how to use one a while ago. I don't, I don't really use it, to be honest, but. Have you got one? I think I do, I have one somewhere. OK. All right. Well, um, I'll send you another one, and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially, uh, couple of puffs to prime it, inside, breathing in and out, um, uh, for five or , five or ten breaths. OK. Uh, yeah. So. Uh, was there anything else that was on your mind? Or you're concerned about at this stage? , I think you got me covered. OK, and, and uh, I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify first seven days, but uh, I think I would advise you just to, rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're OK with that. All right? OK, . All righty. Well, thank you very much. OK. No worries. Any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath. Um, or just generally concerning symptoms, uh, pain in your chest tightness, uh, feeling light-headed. Uh, then, seek further medical attention anytime please. OK? All right, sounds good. OK. Thank you. OK, thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.",

And, are you in a space that's private and quiet, and you can talk? Yeah. Yeah. Good. So, it says, erm, I've got a note to say, it says you're feeling short of breath. Is that correct? Yeah, yeah. OK. Are you able to tell me a little bit more about that? Yeah. I was watching TV and, um, just like over the last hour, I've started to feel, like, a bit short of breath. That is, while you're sitting watching TV? Yeah. OK. And, have you noticed anything like this before? Um, no. OK. And, apart from the shortness of breath, have you noticed anything else? Um, so, I , I started with a cough yesterday. OK. Um. Yeah. I, I don't know if it's, um, relevant, but I had a C-section a few weeks ago. OK. And, how long ago was that? Just a few weeks? Yeah, four weeks. OK. And, are you with baby at the moment? Yes, I am. And, how is baby doing? Yeah. . OK. Any coughs or colds with, uh, them? No, no. He's fine. OK. So, you've noticed shortness of breath for just an hour, while sitting and watching TV? Yep. Mm-hmm. And, you had your C-section a couple of weeks ago? Yeah. And, yesterday you noticed a cough? Yeah. So, talk to me about the cough. Have you bought anything up? Uh, no, I haven't, no. And, when was the last time you were ill with the flu, or symptoms like this? Um, you know, I get coughs and colds quite a lot, but probably. Good few months ago. OK. And, this shortness of breath you're having, is it getting worse? Um. No. I mean, I don't know. I feel like I'm getting really stressed out because, like, my heart, it's really going. OK. So, you're feeling your heart more than normal? Yeah. And, the shortness of breath, does it cause any pain in your chest? Um, no. How about when you take a very deep breath in? Um, I mean, yeah. My chest feels sore, but so does my C-section scar. You know, it's, it's all tender. OK. And, since your C-section, did you have to take any medications? Um, no. Just some painkillers. All right. And, can you remember what the name of those were? Uh, they gave me some, uh, Codeine. And, have you had to use that regularly? Uh, yeah. I, I've been taking that fairly, fairly regularly. But, probably haven't taken it for a week. OK. And, apart from the C-section and the shortness of breath, have you got any other medical problems I should know about? Yeah. Um, no. And, you were . tell you, I'm allergic to Ibuprofen, though. OK. And, what happens when you take Ibuprofen? Um. I don't know. Sorry. So, I need you to do something for me. Have you measured the rate of your heart before? Uh, yes. Have you measured it recently, either with an iWatch or something similar? No, I haven't, no. OK. We might need to do that over the phone. So, are you able to put your right hand on your left wrist, just underneath your thumb? And, see if you can feel your heartbeat. Yep. Yep. So, uh, what I need you to do is, when I count to three, count down from three, just count the number of beats you've noticed. And, I'll tell you when to stop. Is that OK? Mm-hmm. Yep. So, we'll start in three, two, one. Go. Great. That should be enough. How many did you count? Uh, I counted thirty. Good. So, your heart is running slightly fast at the moment, which is probably because of the shortness of breath and some of the pain that you're under. Mm-hmm. OK. Given that you've had a C-section, and you're short of breath, which has come on quite recently and quite quickly It might be worth you going into the hospital to get checked out the bit further. OK. So, there's two ways of us doing this. The first is, I can call an ambulance. Or, you can take yourself to the hospital with baby. Mm-hmm. Which one would you prefer? Uh, it feels a bit dramatic to call an ambulance. Um, I, I will, I will go. I will, I will take myself. Sure. And, what I would suggest is, go fairly quickly and take some bits for baby at the same time. OK. And, if you're taking any medications like Codeine, don't, don't take them for the time being. Mm-hmm, OK. Is anyone else with you at home? Uh, no. My partner's at work. OK. So, I think that's the best thing to do, for the time being. Mm-hmm. So, what I'm worried about at the moment is, given that you've had a C-section Some people can suffer with clots. And, those can either be found in the legs or your chest, so in your lungs. Yeah. It's quite a common thing to happen. And, it's not something to worry about. But, needs to be checked out in the hospital first. OK. And, if it, if that does become the case, they can give you something to reduce the clot. All right, OK. That makes sense. Fairly quick process. OK. Yeah. I mean, my mum's had, uh, clots in her legs before. So, I guess, you know. Yeah, that makes sense. I know, I know what they are. Good. Are you, uh, are you particularly worried about anything, or do you want to ask me anything, before we go? No, no. I'm fine. I'll, uh, I'll just take myself to the hospital. Great. Thank you so much.

So you're losing a lot of, a lot of, you're using a lot of fluid there. Yeah, so I mean I'm , I'm trying to drink a lot of water. But um, yeah it's just quite a lot and Uh it's, yeah I I, I think I I feel like it's just, just fluids coming out. OK. Have you got any blood in your stools? Um So I, no I don't, I don't remember anything, like, no I , I think it's just I, nothing like that. There's nothing like that. OK. And any, any tummy pain? Any, any, any pain in your tummy? Yeah. I mean I, it, I feel, I feel a cramp. and then, and then I know it's time to go right? So, around every hour I just feel something come up. And then I have to go. So, yeah I mean that's, that's the , kind of the first sign. Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? It's kind of, . If I think about it, it's like, it's like at the bottom. Uh, I don't know if that makes sense. Um . Well why don't we start with, is it, is it in the middle, or is it to one particular side? Um I I think it it , it feels pretty , like in the middle, to me. Not on any side, left or right. OK. And does the pain come and go, or is it there constantly? Um, it it comes and goes. It comes and goes. . Fine, OK. And if I was to ask you on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you ever had, how bad is this pain? OK so like Um So What do you mean by, uh pain? So I, I think it's maybe a Is it, is this pain as in making you double over? Is it ten, is it ten out of ten, the worst pain you ever had? Or is it more of a kind of a mild pain, like a three out of ten? I I guess so. I'm, when I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it. So I can still sit down and Uh I can still like cover it up, and people don't really notice. So I, I don't know what that means. But maybe is that like a six, or a seven? solid six. OK, OK. Alright, good. Um, and apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? OK. Um, yeah I definitely, I definitely feel kind of nauseous. Um Like I and, like I've have vomited. And when I like, I think it's maybe something to do with like, whenever I have like milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit. And actually, yeah one time I just like had some milk, and I just completely vomited it. Not sleeping. OK, alright. Uh Um, I've been, I've been trying to avoid it. But um, yeah. And the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea. Is that right? Um, sorry could you repeat that? and the vomiting is not as, uh, prominent as the diarrhea. Is that right? Uh no, no it's not. OK. OK, alright. Um, any other symptoms, like fevers or temperatures? Um so I, yeah I think I am pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time. And uh I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading, or anything like that. But it's, I, yeah I've, I've sure I'm, I'm not a, like not a normal temperature. OK. OK, so you're feeling hoarse. OK. And in terms of your waterworks, are you passing urine OK? Um yeah a bit, I guess less frequently maybe. Um but yeah, it seems to be OK. OK, alright. Um, fine. And, and you said that, you mentioned, three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you for example gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else, um with diarrhea, for example? Um so I , so my um my brother has had, actually had something like this for um he has it as well for five days, as well. Um and I I've, I'm not, yeah I I can't think of what, what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally can deal, deals with this stuff a lot better than me. But , yeah I, that's why Is your, is your brother now better? Um He, so he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not, I'm not really sure. He said, he said he had, he's had something for a little while as well. OK, alright. Are you having anything to eat or drink? Have you, I can see you're drinking a coffee, but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? Um so it just feels like the, the fluids do go down. But it just feels like it's going straight through. It just feels like it's going straight through. OK, alright. Fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat? And which , which uh which you kept in? Um so, I had some, I mean I had some lunch today. Um But again it just it just came, come out pretty loose. OK, alright. Um and and Dan, moving forwards, are you otherwise fit and well, or do you have any other medical history? Um, so I um, yeah I think, I think otherwise I'm fit and well. I um Yeah I mean I, I'm an OK weight. And um, I I can't think of any related medical history. Um, I mean like my, yeah I no I I don't think so. Good. I'll take it you don't take any regular medications, then. So I Um No I mean I, I've been taking some like Paracetamols and stuff like that lately. But uh, I haven't been, I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. OK. And do you have any allergies to any medications? Um, so I don't have any allergies that I know of. OK. And what about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? Um bowel, so would, would bowel like, is is the colon like something that Yeah, yeah. So what I mean by bowel is the whole gut. So it could be anything from the mouth anus. So my, yeah my, my dad actually has um colon cancer at the moment. Ohh dear. I'm very sorry to hear that. How is he? So um, from what I heard he's kind of, So I don't I don't speak to him that often. So I don't, I don't know the exact details. And I, I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer, and all that kind of thing. But um, he's sort of in his third stage. Uh, I'm not sure what that means exactly. Um, and yeah. So yeah it's, it's um, he's, yeah you can, yeah I can see he's kind of weaker, and it's affecting him a lot. And um, that's it's quite, I I guess he's um, had it for a little while now. Yeah, OK. Yeah I'll make a not of that 'cause uh, important to know these kind of details. Um, and socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan? Um so, uh not my brother. He doesn't live with me. I'm, I live with my, um sister and my mum. OK. And, uh, how are things at home? Um, I think, I mean in what sense do you mean that? Don't . in general day-to-day life are you managing OK? Any particular ? I mean uh I think uh, yeah it's been, it's been tricky. Um Going to work with all of this. Um I dislike um, taking time off work. I feel like I I just want to go, um when I can. So I I try and go um I think at, at home, uh yeah I just haven't really um I I don't normally actually um, eat with my family. I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing. So, I don't think it's affected them. And I haven't really been, haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mom about it. Um Yeah. I'd, I'd just rather deal with these things. Um so Sure. you mentioned work. You mentioned work. What is it you do for work? Um So I work at a, I I work at um an office, um in Central London. Um it's uh, so I work in government. , OK. So , OK right. And just a couple last final couple, uh couple questions. Uh, smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke, or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Um so I I smoke um, I smoke uh, uh for like socially, but not like regularly. Um So normally if if it's a, a Friday or something like that I might, I might have a cigarette or something like that. But um not . Sorry? And alcohol? So alcohol, um uh you know I might have a a beer during the weekdays, maybe uh not that many, maybe um . On Fridays I have more um alcohol um But not . But yeah uh, I'll have my units um Uh, honest, I suppose um, not every week, but maybe I'll once or twice a month, that yeah, I'll go out with my friends and drink a lot so that that's um, yeah um Well thank you for me. That's really helpful to know. So um, Dan, just as a a conclusion, uh um, just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis. OK. bit of a basic infection of your tummy. . There's nothing to worry about. Uh um uh uh I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days. OK. Just like you did for you brother. Drink, make sure you drink plenty of fluids, OK? And you can Uh-huh. Should I just drink like normal water? I just feel like every time I drink it's just coming out. Um Right. fluid is probably best. But I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. Um so, you can get things like Diarolyte, which is um, a fluid replacement you can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth uh recommending that. Do i need like a prescription for that? no, you can just get that over the counter. OK. Um, you can try just you know regular Paracetamol if you are feeling feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so forty eight hours, I want you to give me a call back. Because um, you know if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations, OK? But I think let's, let's see how you are in the next one to two days. OK. And uh, we'll catch up soon, OK? OK. So you're saying that I should, I could, uh I'll try and buy this Dioralyte. What, what should I do in terms of um, food and that kind of thing? Should I just focus on fluids? clear fluids. You can use soft diet, things like soup, mash. And then gradually build up, um as much as your body can tolerate. Um, but let's try and keep yourself well-hydrated first, OK? OK. Is it OK for me to carry on having like, um Paracetamol and things like that? Absolutely. If you are having, if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think Paracetamol is very sensible. OK. OK? Try and avoid alcohol if you can. Uh, OK I'll try. Yeah. OK. Alright then. OK. Thank you for your help. Alright. Thank you very much. Thanks, thanks for helping me out. . Thank you. Bye bye now. K. Bye.",

      "reference_text": "Hi there, it's Doctor Smith from Babylon. Hello. Hi there. Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address, please? Yeah, it's Matt Carter, and it's fourteenth of August, nineteen eighty nine, and what was the last bit? Your address. And it's one Babylon Avenue. And are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today? What can I do for you? Yes. Um, coming, I, I don't really know what's been going on, but it's just aching all over, but, definitely the last six weeks, it might have been slightly longer than that, but it's just sort of that, feeling really tired, run down. OK, um, so when do you think you were last well? Uh, where are we now, we've just started April. I, definitely Christmas, New Year, I felt relatively well, I think. Um, so, since then. Actually, yeah, I, I was on holiday in, um, in the States. And yeah, it probably coincided with some time around then. End of January, start of Feb. So do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back? Uh, probably a couple of weeks after I got back. Were you well when you were on holiday? Yeah, had a had a great time, very active, uh. Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhoea, vomiting, anything like that? Um, no, not that I recall. Um, yeah, not. No, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards. OK. So, just tell me what symptoms you've been having, in terms of just your general health. Any persistent cold symptoms or earaches, sore throat, chest cough, shortness of breath, phlegm, anything like that? Uh, no. Any change in your weight at all? Uh, I don't think so. Like, I'm probably less hungry, but no, no weight change, just a bit. OK, and are you eating different amounts? Uh, yeah, probably slightly smaller portions, or it, yeah, more of an effort to, to actually eat everything that's in front of me. Any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat, or abdominal pain? No. Any change in your bowel habit, diarrhoea, vomiting or blood in the stool? Uh, no. Any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine? No, that's all fine. OK, and any other general symptoms like rashes? Or. Um, I don't have any rashes now, but there was, uh, in fact I've got a photo, um, on my phone if if that's helpful. I can try and show you, hang on. Um, because this, yeah, this was weird, this sort of came up, and then, uh. OK. OK. Disappeared after a couple of weeks, where's the light, that, you see that? OK, right, yeah, whereabouts was it? Uh, I think sort of calf, back of my calf, because I didn't notice it, my wife noticed it actually. When did you first notice it? Um, probably, uh, around the end of February, the middle to end of Feb. And then it, like, it didn't actually cause too much itching, or anything, at the time. And, I, it faded over a couple of weeks, I guess. Did you have any fevers at that time? Um, I, to be honest that actually turns out it was a bit of a sore throat I had, um, so possibly a little bit feverish, but I, I sort of put it down to that. Do you know where you got that, when it started? Had you been walking, did you get any bites that you noticed? Uh, I like, I do quite a lot of walking, and we did, um, quite a lot while we were out in the, on holiday as well, but definitely, um. Yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't recall any bugs, I don't remember seeing anything bitten but you often, like, yeah, as you're walking through, I was in shorts and, and boots but / OK. Whereabouts were you in the States? Um, just sort of, um, he examined me, so. OK, and any headaches, blurred vision, tingling, numbness? Um, no. But it's the sort of headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy. And have you been able to go to work as usual? Um, I've been going to work. I don't know how effective it's been. But, yeah, been, been. And what's your job? Um, I work for a health technology company actually. OK, and has your concentration been affected, or your tiredness levels in the daytime at work? Yeah, definitely sort of tired and, um, yeah, less energy, sort of probably than I, I would normally be. Have you been able to exercise OK? Um. Not as much. I, I don't know if it's, I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it. I I'm not exercising as I would normally. OK, fine, and, um, how's your mental health, your stress levels, all that? Hey. Pretty good at the moment, actually. Like, it previously that has been an issue, but, um. Other than, sort of, physically feeling a bit. Uh, crappy, I've. Yeah, in a pretty good place. OK. Apart from that rash, any other rashes on your skin, or swelling of your joints, or pain in your joints? Uh, yeah, sort of aching shoulders, back, the hips, knees, but sort of, yeah. Not , Any swelling that you've noticed? No, . Your hands, wrists, ankles, toes. Uh, no. OK, um, and any other significant medical problems in the past? Uh, I mean. Pardon? Asthma and hay fever if they can help. OK. Any flare-ups of your asthma recently? Uh, no, pretty well , I think. Do you take your regular inhalers or other medication? Uh, yeah. I've got one of those, um, preventative, I think. Yeah , but I've not used one. You haven't been using it, you said? I, I have it. I've been using the everyday for the morning and night but not the, uh, . OK. And any, erm, do you take any other medications? Um, I take, um, one of the antihistamines it might be can I get that from, just from the pharmacy. Yeah, that's fine. Um, and do you smoke? uh, . Drink any alcohol? No. Sorry, occasionally, that was. OK, and who do you live with at home? Uh, just my wife. Um. Sorry, um, so with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, that's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels. Um, I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the normal things, like liver, kidneys, blood count, etc. But also, some more specific things like, um, a bacterial infection you can sometimes get, uh, including one which you can get which can produce a rash like that. So, that would involve blood tests. Are you happy to do that? Uh, yeah, I but, uh, what, what's the infection? Well, you can get, uh, you can get a bacterial infection caused which is called, um, it's called lyme disease that you can get a rash like that from a tick bite. So that's something we would do a test for, as well. Um, and if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it. OK. OK. So it's definitely worth checking for, but we would also check just for which can cause reduced energy, tiredness and aching for, persistent over six weeks. OK. So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line, and then when you've had the test arrange a follow up about a week after, after you've had the test done. OK, so, do the test first and then, and that follow up we can just do over the phone again? Or, yeah. Um, yeah, we can do that over the phone to start with. All right. Excellent. OK? That, that's really helpful, thank you very much. Oops, sorry, you broke up a bit there. Any other questions? Ohh, no, not , no. OK, that's great. Take care. OK, take care, thank you, bye. Sorry",

It might have been slightly longer than that, but it's just sort of that feeling really tired, run down. OK. So when do you think you were last well? Where are we now? We just started April. Definitely Christmas New Year. I felt relatively well, I think. So since then. Actually, yeah, I was on holiday in the States and yeah, it probably coincided with sometime around then, end of January, start of February. So do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back? Probably a couple of weeks after I got back. Were you well when you were on holiday? Yeah, had a great time, very active. Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhea, vomiting, anything like that? No, not that I recall. Yeah, not no, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards. Okay, so just tell me what symptoms you've been having. In terms of just your general health, any persistent cold symptoms or earaches, sore throat, chest cough, shortness of breath, phlegm, anything like that? No. Any change in your weight at all? I don't think so. I'm probably less hungry but no weight change. Just a bit. Are you eating different amounts? Yeah, probably slightly smaller portions or more of an effort to actually eat everything that's in front of me. Any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat or abdominal pain? No. Any change in your bowel habit, diarrhea, vomiting, or blood in the stool? No. Any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine? No, that's all fine. Okay, and any other general symptoms like rashes? I don't have any rashes now. Okay. In fact, I've got a photo on my phone if that's helpful. Okay, I'll try and show you, hang on. Because this, yeah, this was weird. This sort of came up and then disappeared after a couple of weeks. Where's the light? I don't know. That, yeah, whereabouts was it? I think sort of calf, back of my calf. Because I didn't notice it, my wife noticed it actually. When did you first notice it? Probably around the end of February, middle to end of February. And then it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time and it faded over a couple of weeks, I guess. Did you have any fevers at that time? To be honest, that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat I had, so possibly a little bit feverish, but I sort of put it down to that. Do you know where you got that when it started? Had you been walking? Did you get any bites that you noticed? I do quite a lot of walking and we did quite a lot while we were out on holiday as well, but definitely, yeah, I mean, I don't don't recall anybody I don't remember seeing anything bitten but you often like as you're walking through I was in shorts and boots but you feel the odd bit. Whereabouts were you in the States? Just sort of near Yosemite so. Okay and any headaches, blood, vision, tingling, numbness? No sort of headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy. But it's better. And have you been able to go to work as usual? I've been going to work. I don't know how effective it's been, but yeah. And what's your job? I work for a health technology company actually. Okay, and has your concentration been affected or your tiredness levels in the daytime at work? Yeah definitely sort of tired and yeah less energy sort of engaged than I would normally be. Have you been able to exercise okay? Not as much I don't know if it's I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it. I'm not exercising as much as I would normally. Okay, fine. And how's your mental health, your stress levels? I look pretty good at the moment actually. Previously that has been an issue but other than sort of physically feeling a bit crappy, I'm in a pretty good place. Okay, apart from that rash, any other rashes on your skin or swelling of your joints or pain in your joints? Yeah, sort of aching shoulders, back, hips, knees, but sort of Any swelling that you've noticed? No. What happens to wrists, ankles, toes? No. Okay, and any other significant medical problems in the past? I mean, hay fever, do they count? Pardon? Asthma and hay fever, if they count? Okay, any flower obsidian asthma recently? No, it's pretty well controlled. Have you taken regular inhalers or other medication? Yeah, I've got one of those preventers, I think. Yeah, which I take twice a day, but I've not used myself. You haven't been using it, sir? I've been using the every day for the morning and night, but not the albuterol. Okay. And any, do you take any other medications? I think one of the and we can swing the pharmacy. It might be kerosene, can I get that from? Just from the pharmacy. Yeah, that's fine. And do you smoke? No. Drink any alcohol? Sorry, occasionally, that was. Okay, and who do you live with at home? Just my wife. Sorry. So with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, it's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels. I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the normal things like liver, kidneys, blood count, etcetera. But also some more specific things like bacterial infection you can sometimes get, including one that you can get which can produce a rash like that. So that would involve blood tests. Are you happy to do that? Yeah, I'm generally happy with blood tests. What's the infection? Well, you can get bacterial infection caused. It's called Lyme disease, but you can get a rash like that from a tick boat. So that's something we would do a test for as well. Okay. And if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it. So it's definitely worth checking for but we would also check just for other things which can cause reduced energy tiredness and aching for persistent over six weeks. Okay. So if you're happy to do that if you book that through the support line and then when you've had the test arrange a follow up about a week after you've had the test done. Okay, so do the test first and then and that follow up we can just do over the phone again. Or yeah. Yeah, we can do that over the phone to start with. Okay. Excellent. Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you very much. Oh, sorry, you broke up a bit then. Any other questions? Oh, no, not no. Okay, that's great. Take care. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Sorry."

And I just didn't know, who to talk to or, so I wanted to check with my GP. OK. Do you mind just telling me a bit more about, when it started? Do you think there's something which changed in your life at that time? Um, I guess so, I think um, I would say maybe about two months or so, I've been feeling like this, and that probably coincides with, me starting a new job, um. Which I , I would say it's quite , I mean every job is stressful, and when you first start, but it's been really stressful I think over the past two months, definitely. What's your job? Um, so I work for a, a, a fashion retailer, in um, the head office team, and it's just a brand new sector. I've never worked in retail before, my boss is not very nice to me and I don't. But I also think that, it's just been, I just really dread, going there. I just hate, speaking to her, I hate like seeing everyone and, really worried about whether I'm doing well or not. And it's really impacting on like, on the rest of my life, like my sleep and stuff like that. OK. So, um, just day-to-day, tell me, from the start of your day, how it affects you. You said that you, you dread going to work. How, how does it affect you, in terms of like your sleep at night, and things like that? Right. Yeah, this is really so, I, I, I've, as I say like, I don't want to go to work in the morning, so I just find no way of, I can't get out of bed. But it's also because, when I leave I just, when I've left work, I just feel so stressed and so worried about everything I've done, I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours. So I. OK. So what time, what time do you go to bed at night-time? About ten, eleven, probably. And what time do you get to sleep? Not for ages, I'm, I'm lying awake all night OK. And, when you eventually get to sleep, do you wake up with your alarm in the morning, or does something else wake you up, before then? Mmm. So I find my, my heart kind of racing, and then I'm just like panicking that I'm gonna be late, and that that's gonna make work even more stressful. So I do have an alarm, but I find myself waking up before that, 'cause I'm just my heart is racing. And actually the other day, I was just like, I was lying in bed and I really thought my heart was racing so much, I thought I was gonna have a heart attack in the morning. OK. And, so how many hours sleep do you think you get a night? , I just, I can't even tell because I feel like I'm, even when I'm in sleep it's such a shallow sleep, but maybe, three, four hours, I'm getting now. OK. And, what about your eating patterns, any change in how you're eating, or whether you, your appetite's changed? Probably, not, significant changes maybe. No I wouldn't say that, I wouldn't say that I'm eating like, much differently. Ohh that, I probably have more chocolate than normal, just because I feel, so down. OK. You're eating regularly otherwise? Yeah, . OK. And, you told me about the palpitations, just tell me a bit more about that. Yeah, So um, it's, it's usually kind of like, when I realise in the morning that, either um, I feel like I'm gonna be late, because I've like overslept 'cause I'm so tired. Um, or I wake up in a panic thinking I am gonna be late so, it's just kind of like, just a constant like, rapid heart beating. It's just really, really stressful. I don't know if it's, stress or if, , or I did think it was like, a heart problem really actually. Does it feel like a regular fast beat, or an irregular, beat? Irregular, I think. And how long do you think it lasts for when you get it? Ohh it can be anything, I think couple of minutes, or the other day I was actually just, sort of lying there for like, holding my hand on my chest for like ten minutes. OK. Is that something that you've had before this, or is that a new thing? Yeah, but I would say this is only in the past. Sort of like, couple of months as I say that I've been, experiencing this. OK. Any chest pain with that? No, um, well yeah it's painful to , when the heart, when my heart is beating fast but, but, yeah. OK. And, in the daytime, how, how, you said you, you're not getting much sleep so, how's your energy level in the daytime? It's just, really, really low, I mean I, I'm finding now that I'm just, I find no enjoyment at all. It's kind of day-to-day, and anything that I'm doing. It's not just my job it's, you know when I leave I'm just so tired that, anything that, previously was, really fun is just not, it's not enjoyable. And I'm like, yeah, on edge the whole time. OK. So what do you do in the evenings? Well right now I'm, I'm working so late, and everything is really, really stressful. So I don't really get much time to myself but, when I do wanna go out, or, you know, see friends or just relax. It, it seems quite difficult to do that. OK, and , are you avoiding contact with friends, or do you still see them? I avoid them insomuch that I, feel like I'm. Yeah, so I mean sometimes it just, I know that I'm not gonna have fun, because I don't want to, go out and, do things that I would normally have done. OK. What about, hobbies, or exercise, or anything else outside work? Do you do anything else outside work? Yeah, as I say like everything that I had previously been doing has been, just difficult to continue with like, I did used to like to like go running, and. And to play tennis and stuff, but now it's just not, I'm just not enjoying it, I'm not, I'm not like, I'm not going out to do that quite so much. And have you, has it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work? No, 'cause I think that would just add to the tension, but I do like pretty much every morning I think, ohh I should call in sick or like, just not go. OK. And, what's the worst that it's got? Have you ever, been, um, so overwhelmed that you couldn't, get in to the office, you couldn't, go into a situation? Have you ever had a panic attack? , um. No I wouldn't say so, I think, I've always managed to make it to work. But I, I wonder if it's building up. So this is why I wanted to call, I'm just worried it's building up to that, and I don't know what to do 'cause I have, feel it, felt it, get worse and worse over the past couple of months. OK. And apart from work, are there any other situations which evoke quite extreme anxiety, like being, in public places, social situations, public transport, anything like that? Yeah I mean, I find public transport really stressful anyway, especially being on the tube it's, 'cause it's quite, getting warmer so it's just really airless. Um, but I think the majority of it, 'cause my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well. OK. Before this did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this? Not really I, I'm, no, I would say. I mean everybody always has a bit of tension, a bit of anxiety but, I've never felt, anything this bad before. OK. And what about your mood day-to-day? I mean, I can see that you're quite distressed by like that. Do you ever get really down about this? Yeah. Um, I mean, yeah, yeah, 'cause I do, yeah. I'm pretty much, down like, I don't enjoy, being and not just my day at all 'cause. I'm just so worried about everything, um, and I find that even when I'm not, like even at the weekends and stuff it's just the, kind of like constant, feeling of just being a bit, down, a bit unhappy. When do you think you last felt yourself? Um. I don't know, that's a good question, I can't really, I can't really put a on that at all. . And has your mood ever been so low that you've felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job, or with your life, or with your normal, uh, things as they we're going on? I wouldn't, no I wouldn't say that I've had, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any, thoughts that have been that extreme like, I haven't. You know I have, I have a good support system, like I do have good family and stuff. So I, I have, I don't have, uh worries about, actually wanting to, um, not go on. It's just that, I don't wanna go on like this. Yeah. OK. And where do you, who do you live with at home? Sorry? Who do you live with at home? Yeah, I live with my parents, just my parents. Um, and, how much alcohol do you have in an average week do you think? Um, ooh I don't know, probably quite a lot on the Friday or Saturday, just because, that, that's kind of normal, um. Uh, maybe I, maybe I do have like a bit during the week. Like, my parents obviously are retired, so they just drink whenever they want, so, whenever they're having a glass of wine, they'll offer it to me and it's like. I guess I don't really keep track of it that much. OK. So, how much would you, would you guess? Probably like, probably quite a lot on a Friday or Saturday, because it's usually going out, so maybe like. I probably go over my limit just on those days, anyway, and then like, maybe a glass of wine during the week . OK. Do you smoke or take any other drugs, or anything? Um, I try not to smoke, but I do, occasionally, but I don't take drugs. OK. And have you done , anything yourself to help? Have you , have you talked to anyone, talked to any counsellors? Done any, online, looked online at all? Any ways to ? I, well I talk to my mum, because she also suffers from, well she's , suffered from like depression in the past. I didn't think that it was, that I was suffering from, actual depression because it just seems to be, manifesting as, as total , as just stress the whole time. OK. But um, I did talk to my mum about it but I haven't sought any, she recommended that I come to the GP, um, but I haven't sought any other. OK. And would you be happy to, have, some one-to-one therapy? Yeah I think, yeah I think so. I've never done that before, but yeah. OK. I mean what we would suggest in the first instance is to, to. So you can self-refer via the NHS, for what we call like, talking therapy which is a type of inter-behavioural, where they can really look at your situation. How you're reacting to, the, , why, what's provoking anxiety, and what you can do, to try and overcome that. OK. Yeah. Um, so I can send you the link for that. Um, in the meantimes it can be a bit of a wait. There are some online resources that are really helpful. Um, can put the details, on there and you can, get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well. Uh-huh. Um, and if you're feeling like it's not helping at all, or your anxiety is getting worse, to the point where you can't cope with work, or you can't, just do your normal things day-to-day. Then, it's important for us to, for you to give us a call, back and just discuss that, further. OK. . I mean some people, with anxiety they, do need to take medication to control that but that's, not something that we'd suggest in the first instance. OK. And I'll put some more information on your notes about, helping with your, sleep patterns and things like that. That's great, I look forward to reading it. Um, in terms of palpitations, it is most likely to be a, , associated with anxiety, but it's probably worth having couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that, there's not something triggering that off. And then arranging a GP follow-up a week after you've had the tests, so we can just go through the results with you. OK, OK. Yeah, . So if you call the support line you can arrange the, to have the blood test done. OK, I'll call them up. OK? Thank you so much. All right. Take care. Have a good day. Bye. Sorry. .",

Okay, and apart from work, are there any other situations which provoke quite extreme anxiety, like being in public places, social situations, public transport, anything like that? Yeah, I mean, I find public transport really stressful in a way, especially being on the tube because it's quite getting warmer, so it's just really airless.

      "reference_text": "Hello? Hi. Um, should we start? Yeah, okay. Hello how um. Good morning sir, how can I help you this morning? Hello, how are you? Oh hey, um, I've just had some diarrhea for the last three days, um, and it's been affecting me I need to stay close to the toilet. And, um, yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities. Sorry to hear that. Um, and and when you say diarrhea, what'd you mean by diarrhea? Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often? Or are your stools more loose? Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stool, going to the toilet quite often, uh and like some pain in my, like, lower stomach? Okay. And how many times a day are you going, let's say, in the last couple of days? Um, probably like six or seven times a day? Yeah. Six, seven times a day. And you mention it's mainly watery. Have you noticed any other things, like blood in your stools? No, no blood, yeah, just watery and loose stool. Okay. And you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well. Whereabouts is the pain, exactly? Yep. So in my lower abdomen, so, uh, like, um...yeah, just to one side. One side. And what side is that? Uh, on the left side. Left side. Okay, and can you describe the pain to me? Yeah, it feels, um, like a cramp, like a muscular cramp, and, um, yeah i feel a bit uh weak and shaky. Okay. And is the pain, is that, is it there all the time, or does it come and go? Uh, it comes and goes. Come and go. Does the pain move anywhere else, for example towards your back? Uh...no, just maybe my stomach. Okay, fine. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well. What do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been having, uh have you been feeling feverish, for example? Yeah. Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like -- yeah, it just makes me feel weak. I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago. You measure your temperature then? Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know. Okay. Okay. Any other symptoms like sweating, or um, night sweats? No? And, uh, any vomiting at all? Uh, no. Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting. You stopped vomiting, okay. And was your vomit, I know it's not a nice thing to talk about, but was it just normal food colour Yeah. And there was no blood in your vomit, is that right? Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah. No, okay. Um, and um, any any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhea, you mentioned your vomiting, uh, anything else that comes to mind? Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids. Okay. Okay, so you're drinking fluids. Um, what kind of foods have you managed to eat, if anything? Yep. Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly. Okay. Fine. Um, and sir these started three days ago the symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms uh to kick on. So for example, think like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people with similar symptoms. Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here. Okay. Do you remember where you ate? Um, yeah, I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah. Okay. Anyone else unwell with similar symptoms? Um, so no one else in the family, so a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms. Okay, okay. Fine. Um, alright. And uh, in terms of your , your overall health, are you normally fit and well? Or, uh Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine. Okay. And, is your asthma well-controlled? Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control. Fine. And you don't have any other tummy problem, bowel problems I should be aware of? No. No, okay. Um, and apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications? Uh, no, no other medications. Okay, fine. And in terms of just your day to day life, you said it's been affecting your life, um, in what way has it been affecting your life? Yeah. Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern. Okay. Yeah. And have you, are you currently working at the moment? Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant. Would, would work. Okay. Have you been going into work the last three days, or have you been at home? Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult. okay. That must be difficult for you then. fine. And you said, you mentioned you live with your wife and two children, is that right? Yes, yeah. Right, alright. Um, just a couple of other question we need to ask, sir. Um, do you smoke at all? Uh, no, I don't smoke. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. Okay. so um, er normally at this stage I like to um, examine you if that's okay, but um, um, but but having listened to your story, sir, I think uh, um, just to recap for the last three days you've been having loose stool, diarrhea, a bit of tummy pain uh mainly on the left-hand side, um and vomiting and fever and you're quite weak and lethargic um, you mentioned you had this Chinese takeaway as little as three days ago and I wondered whether that might be the cause of your problems. Yeah. Okay. Um, it seems like you may have something, uh, called gastroenteritis, which essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your uh of your tummy. Uh, mainly caused by viruses but there can be a possibility of bacteria uh causing its symptoms. Um. Yeah. Yeah. At this stage, uh, what, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So, um, I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just, um, making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids. Mm-hmm. Um, there are things like Dioralyte you can get from the pharmacy, which uh it's um it helps helps replenish your minerals and vitamins. Okay. Um, and if you are having vomiting diarrhea I would say recommend that in the first, you know, first couple of days. Yep. If you are feeling feverish and weak, eh taking some paracetamol, uh, two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. Yep. I will certainly advise you to take some time off work, actually I know you're quite keen to work but I would say the next two, two to three days as the infection clears from your system to take some time off and rest. Okay. Yeah. Um, I'll admit if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in in three to four days, I'd like to come and see you again. Okay, sure. Because if it is ongoing then we have to wonder whether something else caused your symptoms. Yep. Uh, and we may need to do further tests like um taking a sample of your stool so we can test that. Um, etcetera etcetera. Yep, sure, yep. How's that sound? That sounds great, yeah. Yeah. Do you have any questions for me? Um, no, no further questions, no. Okay, and is uh is the treatment plan clear? Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you. Great. Well, I wish you all the best. Okay, thank you. Bye. Thank you. Bye bye.",
      "hypothesis_text": "Hello. Hello. Hi. Should we stop? Yeah, okay. Hello. Good morning, sir. How can I help you this morning? Hi. I've just had some diarrhea for the last three days and it's been affecting me. I need to stay close to the toilet and yeah, it's been affecting my day to day activities. Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. And when you say diarrhea, what do you mean by diarrhea? Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often or are your stools more loose? Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stool, going to the toilet quite often and like some pain in my lower stomach. Okay. And how many times a day are you going, let's say, over the last couple of days? Probably like six, seven times a day. Six, seven times a day. And you mentioned it's mainly watery. Have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools? No, no blood. Yeah, just watery and loose stool. Okay. And you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well. Yeah. Whereabouts is the pain? Is that so? So it's like in my lower abdomen, so like, yeah, just to one side. One side. And what side is that? On the left side. Left side, okay. And can you describe the pain to me? Yeah, it feels like a cramp, like a muscular cramp. And yeah, I feel a bit weak and shaky. Okay. And does the pain is it there all the time or does it come and go? It comes and goes. Does the pain move anywhere else, for example, towards your back? No, just mainly in my stomach. Okay, fine. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well. What do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been feeling feverish for example? Yeah, it doesn't feel like yeah, I just made it for a week. I haven't had a fever at the moment, but I did notice a temperature when the symptoms started. So yeah, around about three or four days ago. Did you measure your temperature then? Yeah, I didn't measure my temperature, no, but I felt just a bit hot. Okay. Any other other symptoms like sweating or night? No. And any vomiting at all? Yeah, so I vomited at the start of the symptoms, but now I've stopped vomiting. You stopped vomiting. OK. And was your vomit? I know it's not nice things to talk about, but was it just normal food color? Yeah, just normal vomit. And there was no blood in your vomit. Is that right? No blood, no. No, okay. And any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhea, you mentioned the vomiting. Anything else that comes to mind? I had a loss of appetite, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids. Okay, so you're drinking fluids. What kind of foods have you managed to eat, if anything? Just soups and yeah, light foods, like smoothies and liquid foods mainly. Okay, fine. And so you started three days ago, the symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms to kick on? So for example, things like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people who would sing the symptoms. Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, but other than that, I've been eating normally. I think unusual, yeah. Do you remember where you ate? Yeah, I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Okay. Anyone else unwell with similar symptoms? So no one else in the family, so I have a wife and two kids and one child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms. Okay, okay, fine. Right. And in terms of your overall health, are you normally fitting well? Yeah, I mean, other than asthma, I use an inhaler. Everything else is fine. Okay. And is your asthma well controlled? Yeah, that's fine. I just use an inhaler and that's under control. Fine. And you don't have any other tummy problems, bowel problems I should be aware of? No. No, okay. Apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications? No, no other medications. Okay, fine. In terms of just your day to day life, you said it's been affecting your life. In what way has it been affecting your life? So I need to stay close to the toilet because I go quite frequently during these past three days. Okay. Yeah, other than that, it's the main concern. And are you currently working at the moment? Yeah, I work. I'm an accountant. Okay. Have you been going to work the last three days or have you been at home? Yeah, I've been going to work. Okay. That must be difficult for you then. Yeah, it's been quite difficult. Right. And you say you mentioned you live with a wife and two children. Is that right? Yes, yeah. All right. Just a couple of other questions we need to ask. Do you smoke at all? No, I don't smoke. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No, I don't drink alcohol, no. Okay. So normally at this stage I like to examine you if that's okay, but having listened to your story, I think just to recap, for the last three days you've been having loose stool, diarrhea, a bit of tummy pain mainly on the left hand side, and vomiting and feeling generally quite weak and lethargic. You mentioned you're having this Chinese takeaway as well three days ago, and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. It seems like you may have something called gastroenteritis, which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your tummy. Mainly caused by viruses, but it can be a possibility of bacteria causing your symptoms. At this stage, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So I don't think you need anything like antibiotics, it's really just making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking your fluids. There are things like diarrhea you can get from the pharmacy, which it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. And if you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would say recommend that in the first couple of days. If you are feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. I would certainly advise you to take some time off work actually. I know you're quite keen to work. I would say next two to three days as infection clears from your system, just take some time off and rest. If your symptoms haven't got better in three to four days, I'd like to come back and see you again. Okay, sure. Because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing the symptoms. Yeah. And we may need to do further tests like taking a sample of your stool so we can test that, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, sure. How's that sound? That sounds great. Yeah. Do you have any questions for me? No, no further questions. Okay. Is the treatment plan clear? Yeah, yeah. That's very clear. Thank you. Great. Well, I wish you all the best. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye."

Ah OK. Who do you support? Uh, well it's a team, called, Partick Thistle. And they're in the, they're not even in the top division, uh, of the Scottish, league. They're actually in the, the, the championship, which is the league below that, and they're, bottom of the table. Right. So I've been, shouting myself a wee bit hoarse, 'cause their performance has been, uh, pretty shite, if I'm being honest with you. . Well, all sounds fascinating, well I wish them all the best. nothing table. Um, so, so you mentioned sore throat. Um, and have you had a chance to look in the, in the mirror? Have you had a look at the back of your throat? , yeah, yeah, yeah. , aye, I mean aye, I, I shave, every day so I'm, I'm looking at myself, it's not, not, not a pretty sight to be honest at the best of times but it's been a, wee bit, a wee bit rough, uh, the last few days for sure. Yeah, now, I mean have you any, have you noticed any kind of, white spots on the back of your, back of your throat, or redness? Ohh right, right aye. , sorry you mean I'm looking ah right yeah uh. , no I, I don't, I don't really like to look, you know to look at it so I, I, I haven't, haven't tried to do any of that. . . . I understand it's not pretty but as I say it's not, it's not something we, we always um, uh, recommend but um, moving on. In terms of your ears , any dullness or blocked ears, pain in your ears. Uh, yeah, , a, a wee bit I mean . You know, I'm fit, I'm , I'm fifty years old now and my, my hearing's, you know it's not as good as it used to be but, you know I , I, I think, I think it's all right, it's all right. OK, OK. Fine. Um, moving down to your chest. Um, how's your breathing been? So do, you feel more breathless or tight in your chest? Uh. Uh, no. No, no it's, it's not. No, no, no, . . So your breathing is ? , sorry, what was that? Uh, your, your breathing is fine is it? your, it's not laboured, or? No it's, it's, it's, it's not, it's not good. It's not good. OK. It's not good?

No, no it's, it's, it's weird, it's, it's just, you know it's just a wee bit, it's just a wee bit shortness of breath, but it's not, , it's, it's not, it's not pain, you know, as such. No pain, OK, OK. Have you noticed yourself, any, any, any temperatures or fevers? Um, feeling hot and cold? Sweaty? Yeah, yeah that's, that's, that's, that's definitely something I've noticed. Like, you know in, in bed with the wife and having to, you know get out and, get the blanket off, and put it back on again it's, it's not, it's not pleasant. I mean, I'm keeping her up at night as well, which is a, bloody nightmare but, I mean, you know how these things are. . . Yeah, . Seems, seems very difficult at the moment. Um, , have you measured your temperature at all? Have you, got a ? But uh, no I mean, no you know, you know, I can, I just feel it in my forehead but, I mean, I haven't, haven't, you know, used a thermometer or anything. Mmm, OK. Sure, OK. Um, and just moving on, just very quickly. Um, any other symptoms? Any nausea? Any vomiting? Any tummy pain? Uh, the, the first, the first day I had, you know a wee bit, of uh, , you know uh, you know the rot like, a wee bit of diarrhoea. . You know but, but that, that's, that's fine, now. Um, and, , yeah but, but apart from that, , no. . OK. And how's your appetite? Are you eating and drinking OK? Uh, yeah I mean I'm, I'm, I'm trying to and I think what, what is you , you starve, a cold and you, feed the. I, can't remember what it is, but I think I've, uh, my appetite's been, been all right yeah, yeah. I'm trying to, trying to keep, keep the fluids up as well you know, I hear that's what you should do. . Yeah, absolutely, , completely uh, recommend that, so keep, keep doing what you're doing. Um, and just lastly, you know any, any, any kind of muscle pain, joint pains? Yeah. Yeah it's, it's, it's just been a wee. I mean again, you know I'm , I'm getting a just a wee bit older now so it, it's, it's not something that I, I was thinking about but, I have, I have noticed like when I, you know, when I'm bending down and. Know moving about, it's just, a wee, a wee bit stiffer than, than normal. , you know and I'm, I think that might be to do with whatever this. Mmm. Thing is, but, again it's, you know, I'm just getting on. And where do you, where do you feel the stiffness? It it's, just kinda, like you know when you're, when you're bending like, elbows and knees and just, just a wee bit, kinda stiff, you know? , all over, OK. And just remind me sir, when did your symptoms all start? , you say a few days ago? Yeah. Yeah I would say what day is it today? It's uh, , Wednesday, so it would have been, what is it Saturday, 'cause I was out. It's Wednesday. OK. Yeah I was out having dinner, and then, yeah I, I came, yeah, yeah, yeah it would have been that. 'Cause I was out, for my wife's, uh she's, she was, doing this wee thing, we had a wee bit of a celebration, so we were out for that. . And I remember saying to her, it was like you know what? I'm, I'm, I'm not feeling, great. You know I , I stuck it out with her but, aye, it would have been that, Saturday. So, what's that about five, five days ago? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Four, five days ago, yeah. OK. Are you aware of anything that might have set your symptoms off/ No I haven't been, haven't been , I mean, as I said, I was out with my wife. I don't know whether it's like, you know, the restaurant we went to was like, it was like, pretty good, so I wouldn't have expected them to be serving me anything. Dodgy or anything like that but, I , I, I, I don't know, you know. So, , nothing that I can see. , OK. And , without prying too much, what were you celebrating? Well, my wife, has just been, uh, promoted. So, she's now going to be, uh, a head teacher, of, of primary school. So, just took her out. . . . Yeah, wee, a wee night on the tiles, for that, so uh, it was good, . Yeah, yeah. , very nice. , good, excellent. So just moving on sir. Uh, regarding your, um, what we say, past medical history. Are you, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? So anything to do with your heart, lungs? Uh, I mean, I'm a , I'm a wee bit, on the chunky side. You know, uh, you know I've, I've got a wee bit, a wee bit round the midriff, the spare tyre's, definitely there. Uh, and I've, I've got the uh, I've got the diabetes. Diabetes, right. What type of , is it type one or type two? Uh, it's, it's uh, type, two, two. Aye, type one, , aye, aye. 'Cause he said, the doctor I spoke to, he was sort of saying like, you know, as a bigger guy, it's, it's kinda, it's kinda like, yeah, and. OK, OK. And what. . Yeah, OK. . And uh, aye, when I was speaking to uh, it was this, it was other, another doctor I spoke to a while ago but. Aye when he, took the, when he was telling me this as well he, took my blood pressure and that said that was, that was high, uh, high, higher than it should be. . . You've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, uh, or . OK, all right. So um, moving on. Come to your medications, , which medications do you take on a regular basis? . Yeah, yeah. Uh, give me, I'm just gonna check. It's, it's, let me know if I'm pronouncing this correctly 'cause I haven't got, I haven't got my glasses with me. So, it's , Metformin? , that's correct, OK. and, and there's another one, , Lisinopril? Is that? Yeah, . I mean that's those two, I had, I've got them written down a wee bit of paper so. OK. Lisinopril, yeah. That sounds like. No problems, no problem, that's fine. Anything else sir? Uh, no, no, just, just, just those two. Yeah, I mean a wee bit of like , a wee bit of Aspirin or whatever every now and again, but you know nothing long-term. Right. OK, all right. And just moving on swiftly sir. Do you have any allergies at all? Uh, not that I'm, not that I'm aware of. You know, I mean, what, what are the, what are the allergies you get? Just, you know, nah, not. Just allergies to , medications really, I'm, I'm asking not, as opposed to um, other things. Right ah, yeah. No, nothing, nothing that, nothing that I'm aware of, doctor's never said nothing to me, so. . OK. And just very briefly, socially sir, just it's very important to ask. Uh, you said you live, with your wife. Anyone else at home with you? Uh, no, no, kids, the kids have uh, they've flown the nest. So uh, now it's just me and the missus, you know, good life. OK. OK, OK. And are you, yep, and are you working at the moment? Uh, yourself? Uh, I am. Yep, yeah, yeah um, . What, what do you do at work? Uh, well I'm, it's one of the, there's a wee factory, just uh, down the road, um, so we just you know, we just manufacture like uh. Uh, it's like, kind of steel, steel parts, uh, things like that. You know, so it's a, good wee job, you know, keeps us, a roof over the, over us. . Pays the bills, really. Um. Yeah, yeah, aye, exact, exactly. What, what about smoking and alcohol, sir? Do you, you do either? Uh. I, I do, I do like a wee drink. Uh, aye the doc, the old, doctor I had, he, he, he did say I was drinking just a wee, a wee bit too much. I mean I'm not like, you know I'm not, not an alky or anything, but just, just uh, yeah, do like a few, a few pints every now and again. roughly on average, how many you would drink a week? Uh, pints? Well, whatever you drink. Is it , beer, lager, wine, spirits? . You know, maybe, maybe what like four, four pints on like Saturday and then, you know on, Sunday as well, , maybe like. Nine, nine pints in a week, I would say. OK, OK. And what about smoking, sir? Uh, ugh, , a wee, every now and again, but I'm, I, I am trying to cut that down. I've got a wee uh, what are those wee things called? The wee vaporisers. Ohh OK, OK. Yeah I've got, I got, I got myself one of those, so I've been, I've been cutting down on the cigarettes. Uh, and I just got this wee, this wee thing, it's great, it is, it's actually like amazing, by the way. Well, I wish you , all the best on your journey to quit, I , I highly recommend it. Um, if you can, it'll certainly help your health as well. Um, so just to , just to summarise, I think you know, uh, based on your story. Thank you. Um, yeah I'm not, worry. I think you know what you essentially have is a bit of a, a bit of a viral illness perhaps, a bit of a, maybe early signs of a flu, um. Mm-hmm. Which I think should, settle down, um, really on it's own, uh, over time. Um, things to you know, you, you can do, help yourself you know, , stay rested, drink plenty of fluids. Right. Yes, aye. Um, if you are, if you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular Paracetamol would be beneficial. Um, you mentioned feeling a bit short of breath. Um, I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but what we could think about is giving you a. Aye. A script for antibiotics, which maybe use in next, twenty four to forty eight hours, if your symptoms don't get better. Right, so , so if, so if I'm, I just , just lie down and take it easy. If I'm still, feeling a bit rubbish then, I go in, I . Yeah. Yeah, , I will, yeah, I'll, I'll give you a script today, give it about twenty four to forty eight hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and, run-down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like Amoxicillin. One tablet, three times a day. Um, uh, and , if you're still not better by next week, come back and see me, we can have another look. All right, OK. OK, so I just, plenty of rest, lots of water, hopefully this thing pass. Exactly. Yes, absolutely. Right, that is, that's perfect, that's just what, , what I wanted to hear. Great, well, I'm, glad I could help. And um, I wish you and your football team all the best. Cheers. Aye, I hope so, I hope so. It's not, not looking too good, but uh, aye. Right, cheers, cheers, . OK. , all the best. Bye bye.",

Yeah, it's just been a week. I mean, again, you know, I'm getting just a wee bit older now. So it's not something that I was thinking about, but I have noticed like when I'm bending down and moving about, it's just a wee bit stiffer than normal. And I think that might be to do whatever this thing is, but again, it's just getting on Where do you feel the stiffness? It's just kind of like when you're bending elbows and knees and just a wee bit kind of stiff, you know? All over. Okay. And just remind me, Sarah, when did your symptoms all start? You say a few days ago? Yeah, I would say what day is it today? It's Wednesday. Wednesday, so it would have been, was it Saturday, because I was out. I was out having dinner and then yeah, I came, yeah, yeah, yeah, it would have been that because I was out for my wife's, she was doing this weekend with a bit of a celebration. So we're out for that. And I remember sending her, I was like, you know what? I'm not feeling great. You know, I stuck it out with her, but it would have been that Saturday. So what's that book? Five, four, five days ago? Yeah. Okay. Are you aware of anything that might have set your symptoms off? Is it something you've eaten or have you been traveling recently abroad? No, I haven't been, I mean, as I said, I was out with my wife. I don't know whether it's like, you know, the restaurant we went to was like, it was like pretty good, so I wouldn't have expected them to be serving me anything dodgy or anything like that, but I don't know, you know. Okay. So, not even that I can see. And without prying too much, what were you celebrating? Well, my wife has just been promoted, so she's now going to be a head teacher of primary school. So just in contact with her. Yeah, we knight in the tiles for that. So, yeah, yeah. Well, good, excellent. So just moving on, sir, regarding your, what we say, past medical history, do you have any other medical problems that should be aware of? So anything to do with your heart, lungs? I'm a wee bit on the chunky side, you know. I've got a wee bit a wee bit around the midriff. The spare tire is definitely there. And I've got the diabetes. Diabetes, right? What type of diet is it type one or type two? It's type two. Type one. Aye, aye. Because he said the other guy I spoke to was sort of saying like, you know, as a bigger guy, it's kind of like, yeah. Yeah, okay. And when I was speaking to, it was this, it was another doctor I spoke to a while ago, but when he took the, when he was telling me this as well, he took my blood pressure and that he said that was high, higher than it should be. You've been diagnosed with high blood pressure or was that just a wonderful one? Okay, all right. So moving on in terms of your medications, which medications do you take on a regular basis? Give me, I'm just going to check, it's, let me know if I'm pronouncing this correctly because I haven't got my glasses with me. So it's methylormine. That's correct, okay. And there's another one, Lisinopril. Lisinopril, yeah. I think that's those two. I've got them written down with the papers, so. No problems, no problem. Anything else, sir? No, just those two. I mean, a wee bit, like, you know, a wee bit of aspirin or whatever every now and again, but nothing long term. Okay, all right. And just moving on swiftly, sir. Do you have any allergies at all? Not that I'm aware of. I mean, what the allergies you get just Just allergies really, I'm asking as opposed to other things. Right, nothing that I'm aware of. Doctors never said anything to me. Okay. And just very briefly, socially, sir, just one of is very important to ask, you said you live with your wife, anyone else at home with you? No, not kids, the kids have they've formed the nest, so just me and the misses. Okay, yeah. Good luck. Yep, and are you working at the moment yourself? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you do? Well, it's one of the, there's a wee factory just down the road, so we just, you know, we just manufacture like, uh, like kind of steel parts, things like that, you know. So it's a good wee job. It keeps us, the roof over us. Pays the bills, yeah, really. Yeah, exactly. What about smoking and alcohol, sir? Do you either? I do, I do like a wee drink. The old doctor I had, he did say I was drinking just a wee bit too much. I mean, I'm not like, you know, not an alchie or anything, but just, yeah, do like a few pints right now and again. Roughly on average, how many you drink a week? Pints. Well, whatever you drink, is it pine, beer, lager, wine, spirits. Yeah, maybe what? Like four pints on like a Saturday and then, you know, Sunday as well. Maybe like nine pints in a week, I would say. Okay. Okay. And what about smoking, sir? Every now and again, but I'm trying to cut that down. I've got a wee what are those wee things called? The wee vaporizers. Oh, okay. Yeah, I've got myself one of those. So I've been cutting down on the cigarettes and I just got this wee thing. It's great. It's actually amazing. I wish you all the best in your journey to quit. I highly recommend it if you can. It will certainly help your health as well. So just to summarize, I think, you know, based on your story, I'm not worried. I think, you know, what you essentially have is a bit of a viral illness, perhaps, a bit of maybe early signs of a flu, which I think should settle down really on his own over time. Things to, you know, you can do to help yourself, you know, stay rested, drink plenty of fluids. If you are, if you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular paracetamol would be beneficial. You mentioned you're feeling a bit short of breath. I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but what we could think about is giving you a script for antibiotics which you maybe use in the next twenty four to forty hours if your symptoms don't get better. Right, so if I just lie down and take it easy. if I'm still running a bit rubbish, then I'll give you a script today, give it about twenty four to forty hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and run down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like amoxicillin, one tablet three times a day. And if you're still not better by next week, come back and see me and we can have another look. All right, okay, okay, so I just plenty of rest, lots of water. Exactly. Hopefully that pass. Yes, absolutely. All right, that is perfect. That's just what I wanted to hear. Great. Well, I'm glad I could help. And I wish you and your football team all the best. I hope so, I hope so. It's not looking too good, but I Thank you. Cheers. All the best. Bye bye."

You didn't say that you had things like, you had problems looking at the light or something Those are things when you think of Meningitis But and then, it's the uh, in meningitis you get a non-blanching rash. While in any kind of virus the rash usually goes away. Saying that, we don't know whether these are the beginning stage. So that's why I'd rather, but I would rather you see a GP as soon as possible, if uh, we've got a slot available.

Because to keep your a bit comfortable, we'll, you would probably need some antihistamines, which I'm going to prescribe. Also, hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you use for young children. You might probably need a bit more stronger one, like betnovateor something like that. OK? So we'll try that first. So I'm going to it's called the antihistamine is called Fexofenadine. And then we'll try with some Betnovate first. So it's like very small amount, like it's like one fingertip. Yeah. This much is, is enough to cover your palms. And your - back of your hands, yeah? So it's very small amounts, so that if you can imagine you can cover with a very small amount the whole body. Yeah. So use that. You, you have to use it twice a day, for the next couple of weeks. OK. If, if there's no improvement, you need to get back to us. Or, if you have any kind of adverse reaction, like an allergic reaction, which is unlikely, but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us. OK? OK. OK. Thank you very much. So, what we're going to do is, we're going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy. It looks like Boots on the systems, is that correct? Yeah? Yes, so i'll send it across to Boot's. And it will be there for collecting. Yes. If things are getting worse in the next two weeks, call us before hand. Otherwise, wait for two weeks, take the medication and the cream.

Sure. So what we need to do is obviously you've got extensive, as I've mentioned, so extensive eczema. What we'll do, you need a couple of things because to keep you a bit comfortable, you would probably need some histamines, which I'm going to prescribe. Also, hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you use for young children. You might probably need a bit more stronger one like betna weight or something like that. Okay, so we'll try that first. So I'm going to give it's called the antihistamine is called hexaphenidine and then we will try with some betna weight first. So it's like very small amount, like it's like one fingertip. Yeah, this much is enough to cover your palms and back of your hands. So it's a very small amount. So that if you can imagine, you can cover with a very small amount the whole body. So use that. You have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks. Okay. If there's no improvement, you need to get back to us. Or if you have any kind of adverse reaction, like an allergic reaction which is unlikely but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us. Okay? Okay, thank you very much. So what we're going to do is we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy. It looks like boots on the systems. Is that correct? Yeah? Yes. Yes, so I'll send it across to boots and it won't be there for collecting. If things are getting worse in the next two weeks, call us beforehand. Otherwise, wait for two weeks, take the medication and the cream. You still need to continue on your emollients like the dermal soap and as well as the diprovate. Yeah, so you still need to use those in the interim. Any questions at all? No, no questions. Thank you very much. You take care then. Bye bye now. Bye."

      "reference_text": "Hello. Good afternoon. Hiya. Hi there. This is Doctor , from GP at Hand. Hi there. My name's Atan. Hi Anthony. So, could I have your um, before we start, could I have your full name and date of birth? If that's possible? Sure. So, it's Ayrton Warren. Um, and my date of birth, is the sixteenth of May, nineteen, eighty two. That's , thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're OK to speak? I am, yes. OK, great. So how can I help you today? Um, so I kind of woke up this morning, um, and I've just got this, really horrible pain on the left side of my head. Um, a real kind of headachy feeling. Sure, OK. And, um, uh, , did the, did the pain wake you up? Yeah, it woke me up, um, quite early this morning. What, what time did it wake you up? Um, probably around, five thirty ish. And, what time do you normally get up? Um, I normally get up at about, seven o'clock. Is the headache still present now? Yes, it is. OK. Have you had this kind of pain before? Um, I mean uh, I've, had a bit of a history with headaches, but nothing as severe as this before. So they were less severe. Were they similar in nature in terms of being one-sided and the type of pain? Um, not so much on the one side, it tends to be, a bit of a cluster at the front of my head in a way. Um, but this time it's just kind of more prominent on the left side which, I've never really had it, normally they kind of spread across the front of my head. OK, all right. And, um, can I just double-check, do you have any neck stiffness at all? Uh, no. OK. And do you have any fever? No. All right. Um, how are you with bright lights at the moment? Do you feel sensitive to bright lights or can you, can you tolerate them all right, OK? Um, it, I'm a little bit sensitive it just, it kind of, makes my eyes a little bit sore, but nothing that I can't really handle. OK. And, can I just double-check, um, are you feeling nauseous at all? Um, not really, like . When I first got up this morning, my head felt a bit dizzy, but that's kind of subsided now, and I, seems to, be fine. OK. Um, and um, can I just double-check, does anyone in your family have any migraines or anything like that? They've been diagnosed with migraines? Uh, no. They haven't. OK. Um, and um, are you under any particular stress at the moment? Um, work's kind of, um, a bit stressful at the moment. I've got a lot going on. Um, yeah, I just seem to have like, a lot of, kind of, a backlog of work that I need to go through at the moment. So, I've kind of, been, doing a lot of late nights as well. Right, OK. Um, and, um, how long has that been the case for? Uh, for probably about a couple of months now. , how would you say your mood is? Um, I'm not, like moody, I'm not angry or, um, like I get a bit frustrated during the day. Um, but , it kind of, um, ebbs and flows every now and then, but, yeah. OK. Do you have, have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety, or depression or stress in the past? Um, I've had, um, so I had, like anxiety for about, two years now, and I've been on, uh, Sertraline for, a while. OK. Are you taking Sertraline at the moment? Yes. OK. Um, and how do you feel in terms of , anxiety at the moment? Do you feel anxious at the moment? , no, not necessarily at work, sometimes I do feel a bit anxious. Um, but I, I kind of just, uh, the panic of not being able to get my work done on time. Um, but other than that, I, I don't, feel, um, massively anxious. OK, all right. Um, now, sorry to ask this, just need to ask this for , anyone suffering from anxiety. Do you have any , have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself? No. Good, I'm glad to hear that. Um, now, with regards to this headache. Is it worse when you lie down, or um, is, is, is it better when you lie down? Um, when I lay down, like, uh, it kind of feels a little bit sore at first, um and it takes me a while to get comfortable. Um, so yeah, at the beginning it does, but then again that's just kind of, um, soothes a little bit. OK. Um, so, would you say ultimately, it's better when you lie down? Or have you not ? Uh, yeah, I would say so. OK. Um, and um, in terms of um, this, headache since this morning, have you taken anything for it yet? Um, I've taken some Paracetamol. Has that helped? Um, not really, no. OK. Taking anything else at all? No that's it, just Paracetamol. OK. Um, do you have any other illnesses at all? Uh, none. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure? No. Have you ever had your blood pressure checked? No. OK. Um, and are there any illnesses in your family? Um, no, there's nothing. My parents, uh, my mum's had a history of anxiety as well but, no kind of like physical illnesses or anything like that. OK, all right. And um, are you on any medication? Um, no, other, other than Sertraline and having taken, um, Paracetamol this morning, uh, nothing else. Do you have any allergies to any medication? Not that I'm aware of, no. All right. And, are you living by yourself at the moment, or living with someone else? Um, I live with my partner. OK. Are you a smoker? No. OK. And, uh, do you have any pets at home? Uh, I have a cat. OK. And, can I just double-check, how much exercise would you do normally a week? Um, so normally I, try to go running at least three times a week. OK. And what's your diet like? Um, it's OK, um, it's nothing, it's nothing um, really healthy, um, but it's fine. OK. I wouldn't say unhealthy. All right. Um, now um, in terms of this headache, uh, obviously I haven't been able to examine you, or see you directly. But, um, it sounds like it might be one of two things. It could be an element of what we call tension headache. Sure. OK. That's one possibility. Um, and what makes that, more likely is the fact that, you've been under some pressure, and you have a history of anxiety in the past, OK. Um. OK. The other possibility is, um, migraine as well. OK. Um, and, the fact, what makes that more likely is the fact that it's on one side, and that you've got some sensitivity to light. OK. OK, So, what, what I think we can do, is um, I think we can give you some, um, generic, pain relief. OK. That would be the appropriate first step, for, migraine type headaches. OK. So I'll tell you what it is in a second. OK. And the other thing that I was gonna suggest is, we maybe look, explore things to try and decrease the stress from work. So, um, the medication-wise, the things that we'd start off first line, if someone had migraine was to, would be to start Ibuprofen. OK. And um, uh, that, the doses of Ibuprofen can be a bit, more than the normal doses Ibuprofen so that's one thing we can start. You can keep on taking Paracetamol as well if you like, but the, the Ibuprofen's um, actually more effective , for migraine. OK. And, um, yeah, so the, the guidelines have changed, recently we used, we, before that we used to give Paracetamol as first line but now it's, um, Ibuprofen or Aspirin. Ohh right, O. That's, thing. Um, the other thing I'd like you to do, is maybe consider taking some time off work. OK, because if the headache is due to stress from work. OK. OK. Um, maybe having a week off if you self-certify, that might help with things. And I'd also like you to explore, counselling options as well so there's, a counselling service in your area, that I can give you the link for, for you to self-refer. I'd like you to, , OK I'd like you to try that. Um, what, we're gonna do is, we'll have a follow-up in a week's time. Yeah, that'd be. As well as those two things, other things I'd like you to do, is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of seven, eight hours sleep at night, every night. And you're drinking a minimum of, um, one point five to two litres uh, of water or fluids a day, and that's not including coffee or tea. OK. OK. All right, because sometimes dehydration and you know uh, fatigue can be causes of headaches as well. Um. Ohh OK, I didn't realise that. Yeah, so it, that, that, that is um, you know, we need to rule those things out. Um, let's, let's try that. OK. Um, and let's have a follow-up appointment, if we're finding that things are not getting better, we might need to arrange some blood tests or um, look at uh, other possibilities, but, we'll try that in the first instance. Um, if anything changes in the meantime, or you get worried or things get worse. Feel free, have a lower threshold for ringing us back and we can book you an appointment, and we can reassess the situation. OK. Yeah, the, that, that sounds brilliant. Thank you so much for your help. OK, no problem. So there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes. Um, and I'll also leave a link, to some of the danger signs of symptoms of headaches, in the notes. If you can read through that in your own time, that will just help you to have a bit more, control over what's going on and understanding of what, what, what kind of things, should trigger you contacting another doctor. OK. That's perfect. Thank you so much for your help. No problem, OK. So we'll, we'll touch base in a week's time, with me or, myself or one of the other doctors, and we , we'll take it from there, OK. OK. Thank you. Yeah, I'll book an appointment, in, um, yeah, in that time. Brilliant, OK then, all right. Take care then, all the best. Bye. Thank you, and you. Bye bye. Bye.",

      "reference_text": "Hello? Hello? Hello. Um, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your date of birth? Uh, yeah. Uh my name is April, and I'm fifty. You're fifty, OK. April, how can I help you this afternoon? Well I've just been having this like, cough, for quite a few days. And my nose is running. Um and it's just been super annoying, and it's not going away. , OK. When did it all start? Uh I think it started like maybe, a bit less than a week ago. Like maybe, maybe five or six days ago. OK. And you mentioned a couple of things there. You mentioned a cough. You mentioned a bit of a runny nose. Is that right? OK. Let's focus on your cough first. Can you tell me a bit more about your cough? Uh, it's just so continuous. It's really, really frustrating. It's quite dry. And it's just all day, it like keeps me up at night as well, which is really annoying. OK. So it's a dry cough. So you're not bringing up any , you're not bringing up any mucky, ohh I can hear that, yeah. Um you're not bringing up any uh, mucky phlegm or anything like that. No, OK. So it keeps you up at night. Um you mentioned uh the cold symptoms as well, the runny nose. Do you have a do you have a sore throat at all? I mean, apart from, I mean the coughing is giving me a sore throat. But it's not like, you know not more than, than that. You know just, just my throat is irritated from coughing. But it's not like, it's not that bad when I swallow or anything. Right. Do you have any uh, how are your ears? Do you ears feel blocked or? No.They feel OK, actually. Yeah. . Nothing, nothing on the ears. No pain, no discharge coming from your ears. OK, alright. Um fine. In terms of your breathing, how is your , how's your chest? Is your breathing more labored? Um, I don't think so. Like, I guess I get laboured when I'm coughing and I can't breathe. But I, not, yeah, not, I, I don't think so. Not really. Day to day when you walk around, uh you don't feel breathless do you? I don't feel restless. No, I feel you know, generally tired. OK. OK. So like, yeah, but not, not anything special with my chest. Any pain in your chest? No not, not that either. OK. You mentioned feeling tired. Um have you felt feverish at all? Have you had a temperature? Um I've been having like, like shivers, even when I'm in, when I'm in bed. You know like, when you, when you go to sleep and, and you feel like I I should be warm. But I'm still, still you know, shivering a little bit. OK. But I haven't taken my temperature, so I'm not a hundred percent sure if I had a fever. But it feels like I probably did. 'Cause I was just, I was next to my boyfriend. And he was completely warm and totally fine. And I just like couldn't stop shivering. And kept adding more sweaters on, and I was still cold. OK. OK. OK. Alright. Um, fine. And in terms of any other symptoms, so have you had any nausea? Have you had any vomiting? No. No, no nausea. No vomiting. Like, um yeah, nothing like that. OK. How's your appetite? Um, I mean it's OK. I, at the beginning, like when I was starting to have the , the , the coughing and stuff. Um, I had a little bit of diarrhea. Um but, but it didn't, it didn't cut my appetite or anything. I just like, my stomach wasn't feeling great. OK. Has that got better now, the diarrhea? Yeah, yeah. It got better. It was only like the first, like it started at the same time as the cough started. And then it stopped. So I thought everything would be fine. But then the cough just kept going. OK fine. Um, any problems with your waterworks at all? With my what? Uh your your waterworks, your urine. Ohh. Uh, no. No no, it's fine. you're passing urine OK. You're drinking plenty of fluids, and passing urine OK. No. I, I drank loads of water, when I started having the diarrhea. Now that it stopped, I just went back to normal. OK, alright. Um in terms of any other thing, do you notice any, any find any skin rashes, or um problems with your muscles or joints? Uh like my, you know when I had the, when I was telling you I had like the, I had chills, and I was really cold. My muscle was really hurting. Yeah. OK. Sometimes I do pilates. But like, it's hurting me so much at the moment. Um so, to be honest, all I feel like doing is just lying in bed. Right. Right, OK. OK. I'm sorry. That must be very difficult for you. Yeah, right. Especially like in my arms, my legs, like just everywhere basically. quite lethargic and weak, you mentioned. Um, OK. And um, April are you normally otherwise fit and well? Yeah, pretty much. Am I normally what? Uh fit and well. So do you have any other medical history? Uh, well I have type two diabetes. And I have quite high blood pressure. OK. OK. And what do you take for your blood pressure? Any, or what what medications do you take on a regular basis, if you don't mind saying? Um I take Metformin for the diabetes. And I take Lisinopril for the high blood pressure. Yep. Zinopril. OK, fine. Any allergies at all, to medications? No. No allergies. No, OK. Regarding any family history, is there anything I should be aware of? Uh my dad also has type two diabetes. But I think that's it. OK, alright. Who's looking after your diabetes? Is there anyone, is there a doctor in a hospital, who looks after your diabetes? I just regularly go see a doctor. Um, that just checks up on it. Same with the high blood pressure. Like I, I have it under control. And since I've started taking this medication, I've just been like regularly checking that it, it's under control. Right, excellent. And in terms of your social situation, who lives at home with you? Uh just, it's just me and my partner. lives OK, um fine. Is your partner well at the moment? Yeah he has none of this. Like he's just going ahead like, like nothing. Like I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him but, not uh, diarrhea, nothing, fine. Right, OK. So he Go away, he's got away with it, at the moment. OK. And uh, are you working at the moment, April? Uh, yeah I am working. But the, the first day I skipped. because I was feeling just too shit. Um, but then, I just felt like had to go back, 'cause I had so much to do. So I've been going in. But it's not been fun. Yeah. No, I can imagine. What is it that you do for work? Uh, I am a developer. Ohh, so you work in the IT field. OK. IT field. Right, OK. Uh yeah. Work in IT. not too active a job. Uh, yeah. No. Has it been quite stressful recently? Not more than usual. I don't think it's related to stress. Like I, I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work that way. Um OK. The reason I ask is sometimes I've been able to take a day off to try and recover. So yeah, I don't think it's related. Sure. reason I ask is because sometimes stress can really affect your immune system. Um but uh it's good to know you're you're you're not feeling stressed. Um, do you smoke at all, April? I used to, but I've stopped for about six months now. OK. Um and what about alcohol? I mean, yeah I, I don't think I drank that much. Like, I I don't really know how you count the units. So I guess like I don't drink more than like, like, let's say three evenings a week? And I rarely get like properly drunk, or anything. And what is it that you drink? Wine, mostly. The wine. How much do you drink on those nights? Uh, I'd say like maybe two or three glasses. OK. So um, yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of um, the recommended limit. Something think about, just in terms of your blood pressure and diabetes, maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can. Yeah? I should cut down on it. really ideally, the the the right answer is to cut down completely. But so in practice I know that's not realistic. So maybe for the first few weeks, why don't you cut down to two glasses a week. And then, one week thereafter Um and if you are coping OK, then you can maybe try and cut down altogether. OK. OK? Just something for you to think about. Um, right so uh just as we wrap up really, um April I think based on your story, I think uh essentially I think you're, you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness. Um, I don't think there's anything to worry about. Yeah. You know you've had a bit of a cough, bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic. I'm hoping that, you know, you're probably over the worst of it now. It's been five days. I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better in the next couple of days. It normally lasts for about a week to ten days. What, what should I do if it just keeps going on and on? Like if it's still going on in, in say four days? Yeah, absolutely. So, you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to, you know get some nice, good rest. Drink plenty of fluids. Keep yourself well-hydrated. You can take regular Paracetamol. If you feel like you're still not getting any better in two to three days, it's probably worth coming back to see me again. We can check you over. And if you are still feeling feverish, um and your cough isn't getting any better, then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest. some of the uh uh common source of infection. Um Do you think I should keep going to work? Or do you think I should just Yeah so I think you know , really I think it depends on you. it's um if you are coughing, then there is a theoretical, you know risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still. So I would say maybe take a day or two off work, if you can. Uh and get some good bed rest. Um and maybe think about work early next week. OK. OK. Thank you. But um, if your cough isn't getting any better, or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner. OK? OK. But otherwise, I don't need to worry. No no no , nothing to worry about otherwise. OK. Alright. Thank you very much. OK. Well, have a good day. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bye!",

      "reference_text": "Hello. Hi there. I'm Doctor Deen Mirza from Babylon. Good morning. Good morning. Hi, . Good morning. . , sorry, , before we start. Could I get your full name and date of birth? Is that possible? Yes, it's, . Yeah, sure. Um, my name is John Doe. Um, and I am twenty seven years old. Um, so, I was born in nineteen ninety one, um, seventeenth of November. That's perfect, thank you for that. Are you, um, John, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment? Yeah, yeah. , perfect, thank you for that. OK. So, tell me what the problem is. You've been having some difficulty breathing. Is that correct? , yeah, exactly. I've, I'm , kind of struggling to breathe at the moment. I, I got stung by a wasp, um, recently. Well, I'm not sure whether it's kind of bitten or stung. Um, but I, uh, I'm feeling like slightly anxious that, uh, there's a bit of, I've got a bit of a, a rash on my arm where, i got stung. Um, and, I've, kind of. But yeah, as I say, I've got this difficulty breathing and potentially, um, there's a bit of swelling in my lips. My tongue feels a bit weird. Right, OK. So, when did this bee sting or bee bite occur? Um, it was, just a few minutes ago. Right, OK. Um, and, your, your lips don't seem swollen to me right now, but, do they, which. Can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen? Yeah, it's just kind of on the right-hand side. Um, and it, and it's just a bit sore, maybe it hasn't kind of , fully swollen up yet. Sure. Sure, OK. Uh, you said you've been having some difficulty breathing. Yeah. Your breathing seems all right to me right now. Um, the reason why I'm, clarifying is, because we have to decide whether this is a, an acute emergency. Whether I need to send you in to hospital straight away. Yeah. Or whether we, more time to ask questions, OK. So um, , do you feel like you've got difficulty breathing right now, this minute, as we speak? Right. I, I, I , I don't, feel like it's , like particularly acute, but i'm just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a bit worse. I don't, I just wanted to speak to someone. Sure, sure. . Sure. No you, uh, you did the right thing and I, and I can understand it , it is quite anxiety provoking, OK. All right. Can I just double-check? Before we carry on asking other questions. Have you got history of anaphylaxis? Uh, not that I know of. No, OK. Have you ever been given an EpiPen? Uh, I haven't no. No, OK, all right. Let, let's, um, take a step back now. So, in terms of the bee sting, it was a . Did you see a bee or you're, you're just , um, assuming it was a bee? Um, I, , I, I find it difficult to tell the difference between a bee and a wasp, but um, , yeah it was one of the two. . One of the two. , OK. And, um, the area of your body that it stung. Where was it? Did you say it was your arm? Yeah, it was on my arm. All right. And you've got a rash there. Can I have a look? Uh, yeah sure. Um, it's just, just there. OK, all right. That looks OK to me right now. , does it look red to you at the moment? Mm-hmm. It's, it's slightly red, yeah and, and kind of there's, a bit of a, like a hole there, where I think that the wasp, stung me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The puncture mark, yeah, OK, all right. Um, now, is, is there any swelling, around that area, that you can see? I, I couldn't see any. Uh, . Not particularly. I, I guess it's just a bit kind of blotchy, uh, and a bit of a rash. It doesn't feel like, particularly swollen. Um. Sure. OK, all right.Um, now, have you taken any medication? It's probably a , you probably haven't, 'cause it was a few minutes ago. But have you? Is . , not taken , any , antihistamines or anything like that? Not at the, not at the moment, no. Nothing, nothing yet. OK. , now, um, if I can just go back. Do you have any history of any , any, kind of illnesses at all? Um, I've, I've had eczema before. Um. OK, . , that's kind of the, the major thing, nothing, nothing really. , OK. Have you, got a history of any allergies to anything? Uh, I'm allergic to penicillin. All right, good. Um, and in your family, is there any history of any illnesses, or, any history of any kind of acute reactions? Um, not that I think is, particularly relevant, no. I don't have, I don't have any. Right. , and, um, do you have allergies to any kind of, cats, or dogs, or pets, or anything like that? Uh, not that I know of, I've , yeah, I've been around dogs and cats, . Yeah. , and you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware? No. OK. Um, can I ask? Do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks, or anything like that? Uh, yeah, uh, sometimes, occasionally. Right, OK. Have you ever been on medication for that? Um, no. OK. No. Um, great. Now, um, I need to ask a few questions, maybe not directly related to this, but just, it's for, for general information purposes. So, um, , are you working at the moment? Yes. What do you work as? Uh, I am a, uh, computer scientist. OK. And, um, , you living alone? Yes. OK. Do you have any pets at home? Um, I have a cat, at home. A cat. OK, great. What I'd like to do now. If that's OK John? Is, I'd like to have a look inside your mouth, OK. Um, one of the things that, um, we'd be worried about if, someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction. Is to see whether there's any swelling, of the lips, or the tissues inside the mouth, or the. Yep. Yeah. Soft tissues of the airway. And, um, I can, I've got a fairly good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can, bring your device closer to your mouth, and then put your head back, mouth open wide. Sit somewhere where there's good lighting. And I just wanna have a look inside the throat, if that's OK? Perfect, OK, great. Now, um, um, can, can I just get you to do it again? And, just say ah, this time. Yup. Ah. OK, fantastic, brilliant. OK. Um. Uh, John. Based on, um, how you look. How you're talking to me, and how you're breathing, and the appearance, and your wrist. Um, I don't feel that you're having , a, an, an, a life-threatening, uh, allergic reaction. Now it's very normal, to have, a rash, when you have some kind of insect bite. It's uh, it's a localised, um, uh, inflammatory reaction, that um, is normal and that , immediate reaction, that redness, and that maybe slight swelling, is usually temporary. What we're worried about, is when someone has, um, compromise of their breathing. So you mentioned, breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling of your lip. Thankfully I can't see any of that right now. Right. , but that's, the most, urgent and most pressing thing that we'd be watching out for. Given that it hasn't happened, initially, it's unlikely to happen later. OK we, so we have like a , stage one and stage two reaction, for these types of bites. And, usually if you're gonna have the reaction, it will happen straight away. So, , we may be coming out of the danger zone now, it's um. But I'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are, in case it happens. So for example. You would have, swelling of the lips, difficulty breathing. You might have something called stridor, which is an inspiratory sound that you, when you're trying, trying to breathe. It makes like a rasping sound, like this. OK. . Thankfully, you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me like this is a localised allergic reaction. However, if anything changes, if anything deteriorates. Either make an appointment with us, or go straight to A and E. Yeah. Um, uh, and in some cases, if it's, if it's, uh, progressing rapidly, it's better to go straight to A and E, rather than to, wait for a booked appointment with us, OK. What I'd like you to do now, is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines. So you can buy them over the counter. You can get Piriton or Chlorphenamine, and you can take one tablet, four milligrams, um, up to about six times a day. OK. Yeah. Or you can just take a one-a-day one, whichever is your preference, that's, that's absolutely fine, there's no, no issue. That should be enough to control this. Um, if, the redness in your arm spreads, and you, it feels hot, or you, you know, you have signs of any localised infection. We may need to think about other treatments, like an antibiotic. And like I said if anything deteriorates, in terms of your breathing, that's urgent and we need to process that, , action needs to be taken urgently. Yeah. Did you have any other, um, queries or was there anything else that you're worried about? OK. Uh, no, I think, I think that kind of, that makes me feel a bit better. I guess, can I get that um, can I get the, uh, so the antihistamine from any shop, or like does it pharmacy? Yeah, that's, that's over the, yeah , over the counter. You don't need to, any chemist, will have it, you don't need a prescription for that. Yeah, it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually, than to get it via prescription. OK. Um, now, um, uh, on the basis of what you've told me, I don't think you need any allergy testing. I think this is just a , a straightforward localised reaction to a, an insect bite. OK. However, if it was to happen that, you know, this, you're, you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other, , non-specific rashes. We might need to think about blood testing, I don't think we're at, at that moment yet. OK. So uh, but , that's something to bear in mind in case this, becomes a recurrent pattern. OK. OK. OK then, so, we'll leave it like that for now, OK. I'm gonna leave a link to some information about anaphylactic reactions, just for you to read about it. I don't want you to panic, but just for you to be aware what symptoms are. Great. Yeah. If those kind of things happen, get back to us. If you're feeling worried, just have a lower threshold for , having a chat with us, sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down. OK, great. Yeah, that makes sense. All right then John, OK. Uh, well we'll leave it like that, , come back to us if you have any further issues. OK. Thanks. I appreciate your time. My pleasure. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye bye, bye. Bye bye.",
      "hypothesis_text": "Hello. Hi there, I'm Dr Dean Meza from Babylon. Good morning. Good morning. Sorry, before we start, could I get your full name and date of birth? Is that possible? Yeah, sure. My name is Guan Doe and I'm twenty seven years old, so I was born in nineteen ninety one, seventeenth of November. That's perfect. Thank you for that. John, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yeah. Perfect. Thank you for that. OK, so tell me what the problem is. You've been having some difficulty breathing. Is that correct? Yeah, exactly. I'm kind of struggling to breathe at the moment. I got stung by a wasp recently, but I'm not sure whether it's kind of bitten or stung. But I'm feeling like slightly anxious that there's a bit of I've got a bit of a rash on my arm where I got stung. And I've kind of, yeah, as I say, I've got this difficulty breathing and potentially there's a bit of swelling in my lips and tongue. Feels a bit weird. Right. OK. So when did this bee sting or bee bite occur? It was just a few minutes ago. Right. OK. And your lips don't seem swollen to me right now, but do they, which can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen? Yeah, it's just kind of on the right hand side and it's just a bit sore. Maybe it hasn't kind of really swollen up yet. Oh, okay. You said you've been having some difficulty breathing. Yeah. Your breathing seems all right to me right now. The reason why I'm clarifying this is because we have to decide whether this is an acute emergency, whether I need to send you into hospital straight away, or whether I need more time to ask questions. Okay? So do you feel like you've got difficulty breathing right now this minute as we speak? I don't feel like it's particularly acute, but I'm just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a bit worse. Sure, sure. I just wanted to speak to someone. Sure, you did the right thing. And I can understand it is quite anxiety provoking. Okay, all right. Can I just double check before we carry and ask any other questions? Have you got a history of anaphylaxis? Not that I know of. No, okay. Have you ever been given an epipepen? I haven't, no. Okay, all right. Let's take a step back now. So in terms of the bee singer, did you see the bee or you're just assuming it was a bee? I find it difficult to tell the difference between a B and a WAS, but One of the two. Yeah, it was one of the two. Okay, okay. And the area of your body that's down, where was it? Did you say it was your arm? Yeah, it was on my arm. All right, and you've got a rash there, can I have a look? Yeah, sure. It's just there. Okay, all right. That looks okay to me right now. Does it look red to you at the moment? It's slightly red, yeah, and kind of there's a bit of a hole where I think that the puncture mark here. Okay, all right. Now, is there any swelling around that area that you can see? I couldn't see any. Not particularly. I guess it's just a bit kind of blotchy and a bit of a rash. It doesn't feel like particularly swollen. Sure, okay, all right. Now, have you taken any medications? Probably you probably haven't because it was a few minutes ago, but have you not taken any antihistamines or anything like that? Not at the moment, no, nothing yet. Okay, now, if I can just go back, do you have any history of any kind of illnesses at all? I've had eczema before. Okay. That's kind of the major thing. Nothing, nothing really. Okay. Have you got a history of any allergies to anything? I'm allergic to penicillin. All right. Good. And in your family, is there any history of any illnesses or any history of any kind of acute Not that I think is particularly relevant, no. I don't have any. Right. And do you have allergies to any kind of cats or dogs or pets or anything like that? Not that I know of. Yeah, I've been around dogs and cats. Yeah, and you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware? No. Okay. Can I ask, do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks or anything like that? Yeah, sometimes, occasionally. Right, okay. Have you ever been on medication for that? No. Oh no. Great. Now, I need to ask a few questions, maybe not directly related to this, but just for general information purposes. So are you working at the moment? Yes. What do you work as? I am a computer scientist. Okay. And you're living alone? Yes. Okay. Do you have any pets at home? I have a cat. Okay. Great. What I'd like to do now, if that's okay, John, is I'd like to have a look inside your mouth. Okay. One of the things that we'd be worried about if someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction is to see whether there's any swelling of the lips or the tissues inside the mouth, the soft tissues of the airway. And I've got a fairly good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put your mouth open wide, sit somewhere where there's good lighting, and I just want to have a look inside the throat if that's OK. Perfect. Okay, great. Now, can I just get you to do it again? Yeah. Just say ah this time. Ah. Okay, fantastic. Brilliant. Okay. John, based on how you look, how you're talking to me, how you're breathing, and the appearance on your wrist, I don't feel that you're having a life threatening allergic reaction. Now, it's very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite. It's a localized inflammatory reaction that is normal and that immediate reaction, that redness and that's maybe slight swelling is usually temporary. What we're worried about is when someone has compromise of their breathing. So you mentioned breathing difficulties and emitters swelling of your lip. Thankfully, I can't see any of that right now. But that's the most urgent and most pressing thing that we'll be watching out for. Given that it hasn't happened initially, it's unlikely to happen later. Okay, so we have like a stage one or stage two reaction for these types of bites. And usually if you're going to have the reaction it will happen straight away. So we may be coming out of the danger zone now. But I'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens. So for example, you would have swelling of the lips, difficulty breathing, you might have something called stridor, which is an inspiratory sound that when you're trying to breathe it makes like a rasping sound like this. Okay? Thankfully you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me that this is a localized allergic reaction. However, if anything changes, if anything deteriorates, either make an appointment with us or go straight to A and E. And in some cases, if this is progressing rapidly, it's better to go straight to A and E rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us. What I'd like you to do now is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines. So you can bind them to the counter, you can get pyriton or chlorphenamine. And you can take one tablet, four milligrams, up to about six times a day. Okay? Or you can just take a one a day one, whichever is your preference. That's absolutely fine. There's no issue. That should be enough to control this. If the redness in your arm spreads and you feels hot or you have signs of any localised infection, we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic. And like I said, if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing, that's over and we need to process that. It needs to be taken urgently. Did you have any other queries or was there anything else that you were worried about? No, I think that makes me feel a bit better. I guess can I get the antihistamine from any shop? Or like does that have to over don't need to any chemist will have it. You don't need to buy it. Yeah, it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually than to get it by prescription. Okay. Now, on the basis of what you've told me, I don't think you need any allergy testing. I think this is just a straightforward localized reaction to an insect bite. However, if it was to happen that you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other nonsuppressive rashes, We might need to think about blood testing. I don't think we're at that moment yet. OK. But that's something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurrent pattern. OK. OK, then, so we'll leave it like that for now. OK. I'm going to leave it to some information about anaphylactic reactions just for you to read about it. I don't need to panic, but just for you to be aware of what some of the symptoms are. If those kind of things happen, get back to us. If you're feeling worried, just have a low threshold for having a chat with us. Sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down. Okay, great. Yeah, that makes sense. All right then, John. Okay. Well, we'll leave it out. Yeah. Come back to us if you have any further issues. Okay, thanks. I appreciate your time. My pleasure. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye bye."

Sure, um, I'm Amanda Jackson and I'm nineteen years old. Nineteen years old OK Amanda, and how can I help you this afternoon? Um, so it's being going on for a few days now. Um, it's not happened before and I'm bit worried. I've uh it quite hurts when I kind of pee. Um, and yeah it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more, um. And it's really, like I can't, like go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. Um, and it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm, like in at the bottom of my tummy as well. Right OK. I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can, see why it's affecting you. Um, so you mentioned it's been going on for last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. Um, you said you're going to the toilet more often as well, that right? Uh, yeah it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days I think actually, maybe just under a week. Um. Ohh and a week, sorry my . OK, uh. Sorry no I didn't explain it properly before, um yeah no I it's been going on for about just under a week. Um, and yeah I notice a sort of burning, stinging, when I when I go to the toilet, yeah. Are you noticing any, anything in your urine, predominantly blood or um, discolouration of urine? Um, I think, well today I noticed, um, that it was like a bit pink. The, the urine. OK, uh of any kind of frank blood? I mean red blood at all, in your urine? Yeah, I think just today . Um, I think it was probably but I don't know it was pink so. OK. Um, fine we'll we'll have to definitely explore that in a little bit or detail later on. Um, you also mentioned some tummy pain as well, can you tell me a bit more about that pain? Yeah it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy, um, uh mainly when I go to the loo, I think that's when it's worse. OK. Um, can you describe it crampy pain? Is it more of a burning pain? Um, I wouldn't describe it as crampy I don't think it's like a period pain, it's a bit different, it's, it's hard to say, an achey pain I suppose. OK. An aching pain, OK. And does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back? Towards your sides? No, no, no. OK, all right. Um, any other symptoms? Nausea? Vomiting? No, no nausea vomiting. OK. Any temperatures or fevers? Um no, no not that I've noticed. OK, all right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working OK? Uh I, I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any, different, from what it usually is. OK, and when, when when you say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have? Um, I think I have, um, IBS, um, so I just kinda pass, uh, my bowels like quite, quite a lot. Right. Um, and sometimes it's quite, it's quite variable like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, sorry if it's a bit disgusting but like, sometimes it's a bit uh harder and kind of hard to predict. OK, all right but, and you've noticed no new symptoms? No, no, no new symptoms in your bowels? Like, yeah OK. Uh. OK, all right. Um, and Amanda sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions as you can imagine. Um, uh, can I ask? Are you currently uh, are you currently sexually active? At the moment? No, no, not Uh uh yeah um, I have a, a long-term, um, boyfriend. OK, and um, have you noticed any other discharge from down below? So, from from the front passage? Hmm no I don't think so. Nothing unusual. OK. Have you, do you use any form of contraception? Uh yeah, uh I'm um on the pill. The pill. What kind of pill is it? Is it combined pill or the mini-pill? Uh, combined pill. OK, fine. Um, when was the last time you had um, unprotected sex? If you don't want me asking. Um, uh, I mean, mean unprotected as in like no, no condoms or anything? Yeah, exactly. Um, I, I guess 'cause, um, I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend, like. I dunno we've just kind of agreed, uh, so um I guess, a week ago, two weeks ago , quite quite . Yep, a week ago, OK all right. What I'm trying get at is whether um, uh there's any chance you could be pregnant at all. Uh, I know you're on the pill, but um we're we, nonetheless we do have to ask. Um when was your last, when was your last period? Um, two weeks ago. Two weeks ago OK, all right. Just something for us, to bear in mind, if your symptoms don't get any better OK, um. Fine, in terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you, uh eating and drinking OK? Uh, yeah, yeah eating drinking OK. Um, I did have one kinda concern I dunno So I I smoked, uh this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time. Uh, like a week and a half ago, I I just wondered whether it's related at all, probably not but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. Sure, well thanks for sharing with me. Um, so, I, I don't think it's is related to your symptoms, I think it probably just pure pure coincidence, um. Sure OK. Sure. But, uh, you know I do strongly advise you to you know, um, make it a regular habit if you can. Um, just for your, just for your general health moving forwards, OK? OK. Um, fine. Moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions , apart from the IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of? Sure . No, nope. No, OK great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis, apart from the, um, combined pill? Apart from the pill, um, I take, um, something for the IBS as well. Um it begins with an M, it's pretty hard to pronounce like something , maybe. was it, yeah OK. Yeah, yeah that's it. Yeah, yeah that's right. OK, and is that for the cramps, the crampy pain? Yeah, yeah. Yeah OK, and do you have any allergy to any medications? Um, yeah I think there was an antibiotic, um, called Clindamycin mycin . OK, OK, OK. Then I took like something and yeah that, that didn't, go too well, with me. Ritib, OK sure, I'll make a note of that. Um, in terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? No, no. No, or generally anything else, good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation, who's at home with you? Um, so I am living in halls at the moment, uh at uni um, so uh, uh, I'm just living with a flatmate I suppose, um. But my family, uh, live kind of outside of London not too far away. Um, so yeah the my family are fine and I see them now and then. Uh, yeah things I think, I think they're OK generally. Very good. Great, and what are you studying at university? I'm studying, uh, English. English, OK good, and how are you enjoying your course? Yeah, yeah it's it's going well thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago, a few months ago and yeah I, I really enjoy it. Yeah, yeah it's really fun. Good. Very good, very good, good. Um, in terms of smoking and alcohol, do you, do you participate in either? Uh, as I admitted before I tried weed for the first time, uh, but, uh, I don't smoke. Uh ,I drink occasionally, um, kind of socially, um, with friends . O K OK, what, what's made you have your first joint last week? Was Um, I it was just a party,.Um, there were other people doing it, um. OK. I kind of was a little bit tipsy so, probably wasn't thinking quite straight. Um, but yeah I, I completely agree it's not something I wanna get into on a regular basis. Sure, uh, and obviously as your doctor I'm here to look after you so yeah I I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid if you can. Great, um, fine so, at this stage I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story I think, um, you know, uh, I'm reassured. Sure. But the fact that I, I I think it's, um, probably just a simple what we'd say a UTI or a cystitis, bladder infection. OK. Uh, you know you haven't got any other symptoms that, suggest to me that there's anything to worry about, so things like fevers and back pain. Um, would be more worrying for me to hear. Um, so it's something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. Um, so we've got a choice of two antibiotics something called Trimethoprim or, Nitrofurantoin which is a three day course. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And normally they're usually quite effective, um, for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample today as well if you can, so we can send it off to the lab. And see exactly what's going on there. Um, start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids. OK. Um, if you are having some pain, simple Paracetamol, um, would probably be advisable. Yeah. Um, we'll see what the urine sample shows. Um, and if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. OK. Um, but if things still are still not getting any better next week come back and see me, and we can have another look again. OK, OK uh great. Um, with, with the urine sample, um, uh, how do I go about doing that, do you know? Is it through the app? So if I'll give yeah no it's a well uh so yeah good question, so I will give you I will organise uh for you to come in, and drop off a sample at one of our practices, um which we can test there and then, at the urine and send it off to the lab uh we can back in touch with you with the results. OK. OK perfect. Great. OK, do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those give me a call, OK? Either back pain, vomiting, great OK. Yeah, I'll watch out for those. All right, OK. Have a good day. Thank you, bye bye. OK, great thank you. You too, have a good day, bye bye.",
      "hypothesis_text": "Hello. Hi. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, I can hear you. Right, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Sure. I'm Amanda Jackson and I'm nineteen years old. nineteen years old. Okay, Amanda, and how can I help you this afternoon? So it's been going on for a few days now. It's not happened before and I'm a bit worried. It hurts when I kind of pee. And yeah, it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more. And it's really like I can't go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. Oh dear. And it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in the bottom of my tummy as well. Right. OK. I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you. So you mentioned you've been going for the last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. You're going to the toilet more often as well, is that right? Yeah, it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days, I think actually. Maybe just under a week. Oh, under a week, sorry. Okay. Sorry, no, I didn't explain it properly before. Yeah, no, I, it's been going on for about just under a week. And yeah, I noticed sort of burning, stinging when I go to the toilet. Yeah. Have you noticed anything in your urine, for example, any blood or discoloration of urine? I think, well, today I noticed that it was like a bit pink, the urine. Okay. Yeah. I think just today. Have you noticed any kind of frank blood, any red blood at all in your urine? I think it was thin probably. I don't know, it was pink, so. Okay, fine, we'll definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on. You also mentioned some tummy pain as well. Can you tell me a bit more about that pain? Yeah, it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy, mainly when I go to the loo. I think that's when it's worse. Okay. Can you describe as a crampy pain, as a more of a burning pain? I wouldn't describe as crampy. I don't think it's like a period pain. It's a bit different. It's hard to say an achy pain, I suppose. Achy pain. Okay. Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back, towards your sides? No, no. Okay. All right. Any other symptoms at all? For example, nausea, vomiting? No. No nausea, vomiting. Okay, any temperatures or fevers? No, no, not that I've noticed. Okay, all right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working okay? I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any different. Okay, and what it usually is. When you say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have? I think I have IBS. So I just kind of pass my bowels like quite a lot. And sometimes it's quite variable, like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit it's sorry, this is a bit disgusting, but like sometimes it's a bit harder and hard to predict. Okay, all right. But you've noticed no new symptoms in your bowels. No, no, not that. Okay, all right. And Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions as you can imagine. Can I ask, are you currently sexually active at the moment? Yeah, I have a long term boyfriend. Okay, and have you noticed any other discharge from down below so from the front passage? No, I don't think so. Nothing unusual. Okay, do you use any form of contraception? Yeah, I'm on the pill. The pill? What kind of pill is it? Is it a combined pill or the mini pill? A combined pill. Okay, fine. When was the last time you had unprotected sex? If you don't want me asking that. I mean, unprotected is in like no condoms or anything. Yeah, exactly. I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend. It's like, I don't know, we've just kind of agreed. So I guess a week ago. Two weeks ago. Okay, all right. What I'm trying to get at is whether there's any chance you'll be pregnant at all. I know you're on the pill, but nonetheless we do have to ask. When was your last period? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, okay, all right. Just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better, okay? Fine. In terms of your general health otherwise at the moment, are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, yeah, eating and drinking okay. I did have one kind of concern. I don't know So I smoked, this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time, like a week and a half ago. I just wondered whether it's related at all, probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. Sure. Well, thanks for sharing with me. So I don't think it is related to your symptoms. I think it's probably just a pure coincidence, but I do strongly advise you to make it a regular habit if you can, just for your general health moving forward. Okay. Fine. Moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions apart from the IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of? No. No. Okay, great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the combined pill? Apart from the pill, I take something for the IBS as well. It begins with an M. It's really hard to pronounce, like mehbeh something. Maybe. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Okay, and then that's the cramps, the crampy pain. Yeah, yeah, thank you. And do you have any allergies to any medications? Yeah, I think there was an antibiotic called Clindamycin. Clindamycin. Okay, okay. That took like a couple years ago something and yeah, that didn't go too well. Right, okay, sure. I'll make a note of that. In terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? No. No problem with anything else. Good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? So I am living in Halls at the moment, uni. So I'm just living with a flatmate, I suppose. But my family live kind of outside of London, not too far away. So yeah, my family are fine and I see them now and then. Very good. Yeah, things are okay generally. Great and what are you studying at university? I'm studying English. English, okay, good. And how are you enjoying your course? Yeah, yeah, it's going well. Thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago. Yeah, I really enjoy it. Very good. In terms of smoking and alcohol, do you participate in either? As I admitted before, I tried weed for the first time, but I don't smoke. I drink occasionally, kind of socially with friends. Okay, and what made you have your first joint last week? It that? It was just a party. There were other people doing it. I kind of was a little bit tipsy. Probably wasn't thinking quite straight. But yeah, I completely agree. It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure. And obviously, your doctor has something to look after you. So I would strongly recommend you to avoid it. Great. Fine. So at this age, I wouldn't normally examine you. But I think based on your story, I think I'm reassured by the fact that I think it's probably just a simple what we say, UTI or cystitis bladder infection.

So I will give you, I will organize for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices, which we can test there and then with a urine date and send it off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results. Okay, perfect. Okay, great. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call, okay? Fever, back pain, vomiting, great. Okay, yeah. Okay, have a good day. Okay. Thank you. You too. Have a good day. Bye."

I think you probably have, you know a bit of a viral, what we say viral illness, maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection, or maybe early signs of a flu. Um these normally last about seven to days and just gets better really, um over time. But things you can do to really help yourself, um is get plenty of rest. I'd probably advise you taking a day or two off work if you can. Um Making yourself, pushing fluids and make yourself well-hydrated. Continue with the regular Paracetamol, Ibuprofen. Um and and you should see how things go, really. Um if next week you're still not better, I'd like you to come back and see me. Um is that clear? Does that, does that make, does that make Yeah, yeah, that's that's , it makes sense. Uh, I think I'll take a couple days off, and see how it goes.

Um, it's, it's not too bad, it's sort of like a stinging kind of pain. Um. It's not like unbearable, but uh, it's , it's definitely uh, it definitely bothers me when I pee. Um. And uh, yeah I also maybe sometimes get some like, pain kind of lower down in my tummy, when I, when I go to the bathroom. Uh, yeah. , OK. And, and, uh, the pain in your tummy, is it, can you describe the , the pain to me? Is it cramping, burning, sharp? , yeah, I don't know maybe uh, sort of, sort of cramping.

Um, OK. Um, in terms of your bowel, are your bowels working OK? Um, uh, I think so, yeah, it seems . So, uh, by that I mean, um, any, any diarrhoea, loose stool? Uh, no, not that I've, not that I've noticed at all. OK, all right. And um, Jessica, sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions, uh, just to , get a full history. Um, hope you don't mind me asking, but are you currently sexually active? Uh, yeah I am. OK, is that with a regular, partner? Ohh, yeah, so I, I've had a boyfriend for about a, a couple of months now, yeah. Fine, OK. Um, have you noticed any other discharge from, from down below? I haven't noticed anything. No, OK. When was your last um, uh, last STD screen? If, if ever? Don't think I've ever, I don't think I've ever had one. No, OK, fine. And, and um. Do you use any form of contraception, at all? Uh, yeah, we use condoms. You use condoms, OK. And when was your last, period? Uh, couple of weeks ago. Three weeks ago, OK. Is there any chance you could be pregnant perhaps? Say again. Is there any chance you could be pregnant? Uh, I don't think so, I don't. No, no. , it's always worth asking uh, young females like yourself, um. Uh, um, so if that obviously you are worried about the pain. Yeah. Um, not getting any better, uh, then I'd always , advise getting a pregnancy test, to rule out pregnancy. OK? Um, fine. So just moving on, moving on. Are you otherwise fit and well? Uh-huh. Um, yeah, I think I'm, I'm feeling OK, otherwise, yeah. And so by that I mean, do you have any other medical problems, medical , medical history? Um, so, in the past I've had some uh, some IBS. Um. But, other than that I think no like uh, real serious medical problems that seem, yeah. OK. Do you take any regular medications? Uh, no, I did uh, I did uh, a little bit ago, or a couple of days ago, try some uh, over the counter bicarbonate, to try and help with the pain but it wasn't, it wasn't really helping. OK. So you've tried that and it didn't help? OK, all right. Um, do you have any allergies to any medications? Uh, yeah, I'm allergic to, Clindamycin. And what happens when you take Clindamycin? Um, I, I get some like a, a, a swelling, basically. Right then, OK. So it's quite a, seems like a quite severe allergy to it, is , is that right? Um, OK. Fine. In terms of your family history, is there anything I should be aware of, um, related to kidneys, bladder, bowels, guts? Yeah. Uh, no I don't think so, not that I, not anything I know about. OK, all right. And tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's lives, who's at home with you? Um, so I live in a, live in a flat near my college, with a, a couple of like friends of mine. Uh, so I'm, I'm not like living at home or anything. Um. OK, and what . about sorry. OK, and are you a, are you working at the moment, or are you a student? I'm a student. OK, and what are you studying? Uh, I'm studying biology. And how's that going? Um, it's good yeah, it's really, it's really interesting uh, learning about, learning about how uh, how the world works, yeah. great. Do you have any aspirations for the future, in terms of careers? Uh, I don't know, maybe a doctor someday, you never know. , recommend it, we need doctors. Um, what about smoking and alcohol? Do you drink much in the way of, , do you, do you smoke, or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Uh, I don't, I don't smoke, uh, I do drink, like on the weekends, yeah. , so socially, OK. All right. Um, right, excellent. So, um, at this stage I , I would proceed to examination. Yeah. But um, based on your story, um, just to summarise really. So, last three days, you've been having bit of burning pain on passing urine. A bit of, crampy tummy pain lower down. Um, , essentially but, but no other fevers or back pain, uh, if I, if I understand correctly. I think probably do have what we call a simple UTI or urinary tract infection, bladder infection, um, which can be readily treated. So, I'll give you a course of antibiotics today. Mm-hmm. OK. Something, called either Nitrofurantoin, or Trimethoprim. Uh, and it's normally a three day course. Uh, so, one tablet, twice a day, for three days. OK. And , that should hopefully help your symptoms, but I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids. Let's try and flush that, you know, that infection out of your body, if you can. OK. Um, you can try, cranberry juice, that can sometimes help with your symptoms. Um, and if you're still not better, by the end of this week, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me. And uh, we can have another look at your symptoms. OK, so three days of the medication, and then wait a little bit, if it still doesn't go away, call back, that OK? OK. Yeah, yeah absolutely. And things to look out for would be, you know, if you are having kind of, high temperatures, a back pain, um just , generally feeling more unwell. Uh, you know, I do want you give me a call back, 'cause then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we wanna avoid. So, do, do give me a call if you're having any concerns, OK. OK. OK, is there, is there anything like, like, should I be worried about? Like, like, not having sex or anything within the next week, or anything like this? Yeah I mean if you can try and avoid it, I think that'd be sensible. Um, uh, it's great that you're using barrier contraception. I would recommend you to continue using barrier contraception, but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up. That'd probably be the best for you and your boyfriend,. OK, OK. Uh, that, that makes sense. Ohh, OK, thank you so much. All right. Great. Thank you very much. Wish you all the best. Yeah, thank you. Take care.",

I mean, if you can try and avoid it, I think that would be sensible. It's great at using barrier conception. I recommend you to continue using barrier conception, but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up, that would probably be the best for you and your boyfriend. Okay, all right. That makes sense. Great. Okay, thank you so much. Wish you all the best. Yeah, thank you."

Sore throat? Uh, I I've been feeling really hot, um, I don't know if it's fever as such, but, like, to touch I'm quite hot but sometimes I'm feeling really chilly, needing to be under a blanket, that sort of thing. Have you checked your temperature with a thermometer? Uhh, no, I haven't. OK. Um, and are you eating and drinking normally? Uhh, yes. Um, kind of around when it started, I had some diarrhoea, but I don't know if that was associated. But since then it's all been pretty fine. OK. So, you're drinking well, holding down fluids OK? Yeah. And passing water OK? Yeah, that's fine. No vomiting, diarrhoea now? No. OK, that's fine. Um, any rashes that you've noticed? Rashes? Uhh, no, nothing like that. Yeah. Any headaches or change in your vision? No, um, I've had quite achy muscles, but that's pretty much it. OK. And normally, do you have any chest problems? Uh, no. Do you ever get wheezing, short of breath? Uh, I mean, like, if I do intense exercise, then yes. But not . . And, do you regularly have any infections in your chest, or anything that needs treatment, normally? No, uh, I've got hypertension, um, so I'm on some drugs for that, um, but that's it, really. OK. Um, any other medical problems? Uh, just the hypertension and the diabetes. OK, and what type of drugs are you on? Uh, I think something called metformin, and lisinopril I think is the other one. OK, and when did you last have your blood pressure checked? Uh, ooh, uh, a while ago. Um, . Do you know if it, do you know if it's been stable? Uh, I can't remember. OK. And with your blood, with your diabetes, have you had a blood test recently? Um, yeah. Like. Yeah, it was normal. It was around three weeks ago. OK, and do you know what dose of the lisinopril you're taking? Uh, two hundred. OK. Have you been able to pass water normally? Any increase in in frequency that you're passing water or any increased thirst? Uh, no, not particularly. And has your weight been stable? Yeah. What is your weight and height? Uh, my height is five foot five, and my weight is sixty five kilograms. OK. And do you smoke at all? You drink any alcohol? Yes, the odd cherry. OK.Um, who do you live with at home? Uh, my partner and my dog. And do you work? Uh, yes. I'm an office manager. OK. And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms? Anything that you've bought in the chemist? Um, uh, a quite a few lemon sips. Um, they seems to be helping. Do you, what, what do you mean by quite a few? How many in, in a day do you normally take? Uh, maybe two or three. Maybe, like, at the start of the day and at the end of the day. OK. Have you noticed any improvement in that? Yeah. It tends to soothe my throat a bit for when I'm going to sleep. OK. Um, do you have any allergies to anything? Uh, I sometimes suffer from some, like, hay fever. But, um, but it's not bad Any . Any allergies to any medications at all? Not that I'm aware of, no. OK. So, what you've described to me, it sounds like you, you probably have got an infection in the chest, um, because it's, it, you know, you're obviously getting symptoms of from your nose and your chest. Um, it sounds like you might have a high temperature, it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature. OK. I can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something? Yeah, and most of the time, these infections are caused by viruses, so they do normally settle by themselves. But it can take, you know, a week or two, um, and you can persistently have the cough ongoing longer than that. Um, the important thing to do would be to take your temperature. Um, and if you feel like, if the temperature's ongoing, above thirty seven point five, thirty eight, um, and you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down, or your cough's getting worse, you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out your nose, um, or any shortness of breath, chest pain, then we certainly would need to speak to you again. With the diabetes you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes, so it's something we do need to be careful of. OK. OK. So, then we would at potentially antibiotics at that time, perhaps? Yeah, potentially. If it is, if it's not settling or the temperature's ongoing, getting worse, then we definitely need to talk to you again. OK. Um, have you got any other questions? Um, no, that's all fine. It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment, with the lemsip. I wouldn't take, and that, that contains paracetamol so don't take any other paracetamol containing products, um, with that at the same time. Yeah. Um, the cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime because it's best for your body if you just keep coughing. But if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all, then it, it's OK to have a little bit of cough syrup, just to settle that down. OK. Cool. OK? Do you have blood sugar checking equipment? Do you check? No, OK. Well, if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your GP has asked you for? Yep. I'm not at home. Yeah. OK, great. Alright then, take care. Bye. Alright. Thanks so much. Bye.",

      "reference_text": "Hi. Hello. Hi, I'm Doctor Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Hi. So, um, just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please? And your date of birth? Sure, my name is Mary Smith. My date of birth is August sixteen, nineteen seventy six. And your email address for me, please. My email address is Mary dot Smith at gmail dot com. That's correct. And just to confirm, that you're in a secure location, and we can have a confidential conversation. Absolutely. Right. So you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw. Is that correct? Um, well. I think that's just, like, the first thing that I typed, but, uh, uh, it wasn't really what I, you know, I just typed it and then I clicked submit, so, that was uh, um. I mean it's part of the problem but I would say that, more of a problem for me, is that I can't quite move my left arm. I mean, I can move it but it's it's numb, and then I also feel some, like tingling in my fingertips. OK, so numbness in the left arm, yeah? How long has it been going on for? Yes, yes. So, I've started taking this boxing class. I've been taking this boxing class for a few weeks, and I feel like maybe, um Mm hmm. It's probably been, I'd say, for at least two weeks, and it's kind of gotten worse. Like,in the beginning, I just kind of felt a little bit of a tingling. Mm-hmm. and then it's gotten, it's gotten worse since then. Then the numbing kind of started I can feel it both in my, uh, um, you know a little bit in my elbow, and then in my arm, as well as in my hand Mm-hmm. And now because it hasn't gotten better, I tried to get a massage, it's not better. Or, you know, try to take warm baths. It's not better, so I figured I'd call you and, and just figure out what's going on. Right. So, have you mentioned that message and a warm bath, any medications that you've taken so far? Uh, well it's. You know it's, it's numb and I, I kind of looked at stuff online, um, but you know I, I do take Ibuprofen because my muscles were sore, a little bit, and I've been taking this boxing class. Uh huh. So, you know, I kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand. So that's been a little bit painful, so I've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that. OK. But, like I said, I mean, I tried massage, I tried some hot baths, and that didn't help with this numbness thing. Mmm. Sure. I'm just kind of getting a little worried. Of course. So you just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards, is that, you know, the tingling, numbness elbow . Not from your shoulder? And, um, well it's kind of funny, you know sometimes I will feel it in my shoulder. Like if I try to, if I try to like you know move like in boxing and stuff, I will even like, uh, um, maybe feel a little bit of, a little bit of pain. Uh, but I would say, if i'm just like resting if I'm sitting like, right now, I can feel like it's numb, and I, I actually feel, tingling right now, not in all of my fingers, just in some. Yeah. So, which fingers do you feel numb? OK, so it's my second, third, and fourth finger. Uh huh. Second, third and fourth finger. And is it your palm side or, you know, the back of your hand side which is numb, or both? No. It's, it's the, it's this side. So, the front side. It's the front side. OK, right. And have you been dropping things at all? Like, you know, when you try to hold onto things, like a glass or something, have dropping it? Yes. So not so much with the glass, but I will say, um, well I play a little bit of a piano and so I just noticed it's been kind of harder to get the notes. Mm-hmm. I can, I can grasp, I can grasp a a glass but because I use my right hand most of the time, you know, I'm not left handed so, it's kind of hard for me to. So So you would say this in mind weakness, mind. So just to get my facts right. So you would say it's definitely weakness rather than because of the pain, you can't hold it. That's two different things. So you know sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you . Yes. Yeah. No, no, it's not hurting, it's not hurting, it's, like, numb, I can't feel it, right? Well, yeah. OK. Fine. So, you're definitely having some sort some form of weakness, OK. Edward, any neck pain at all? Yes, absolutely. No, not, no, nothing . neck pain and all? OK, right, OK. So, just a bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system. Um, do you have any past, uh, medical history that you'd like to share? Mm hmm. Well, I guess because of this. You know, I'm not sure if it's boxing. I also had a really bad cold, like a month ago. Mm-hmm. I mean, I was out, you know, drinking with, uh, friends, um, one of our co-workers just had his three year anniversary and We kinda went crazy and we were like out partying until, you know, late hours, and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me. And then after that, I was sick for probably good like two weeks. I was at home. I think I must have had some kind of like a flu or something. what Mm-hmm. So it's that. And then, I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago, is like, I all of a sudden just couldn't see from the, uh, from my left eye. Like, I, I lost some, like a little bit of a field of vision Uh, and, but that, that just lasted not very long. I mean, that just lasted maybe for, I don't know, twenty, twenty minutes? OK. Uh, and I kind of thought, I don't know maybe it was the the cold you know and the virus and all that so Mm-hmm. I, I guess that's what I can, you know, that's the last thing I can remember, but in general, I'm, I'm pretty healthy. You know, I work out, uh, , and I, I don't really have any medical problems. Yeah. Do you have any headaches at all, from the, in the recent past? Um, sometimes I get headaches but I think they're just tired headaches. You know sometimes I'll get kind of Tired but I think that's probably because I work too much. Or, you know because like I'll go for a workout and then I'll really just exhaust myself and then I just kind of feel this fatigue. Uh, or sometimes like this morning for example, I just felt really, fatigued and I couldn't even get myself to the gym. But, you know, since I have this numbness it's kind of like, hard to workout right? Hmm. Do you wear glasses at all, glasses, contact lenses? No. No, so no glasses . And, you've not experienced anything like a seizure or a fit, anything like that? What's a seizure? Like when you you lose consciousness and you start shaking. Ohh, no, no, no, no, nothing like that, mmm mmm. OK, no fits, yeah, OK. And your weakness is only in your left arm. Legs are walking and all this, normal, yeah? Right, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah, walking is normal, yeah. You mentioned for a while you couldn't see, you know, the outside peripheral vision from your left eye. How long did that episode last for? You know I think it was only maybe like twenty minutes or so. It's almost like it happened and I thought ohh my God. It's probably I'm still like sick from this, you know virus thing, cold, and so I just kind of slacked it off. And then when I, uh, um, when I woke up it was gone. Sure, OK. Um, OK. So is there any regular medications that you're using? Not really. I just take ibuprofen every once in a while, I take vitamin D. Um, I take some I, I like my my GP really wants me to take iron supplements, but you know, they're just like huge pills so I, I, most of the time I just forget. OK. But, vitamin D I take. And then, sometimes I take Melatonin to help me sleep. OK Alright. And any family history you'd like to share? Any significant family history? I know that my dad has I don't know if it it's hypo, I think it's hypothyroidism. Yeah. Um, and then my, like, he's got he's got some autoimmune stuff going on, like that much I know. Mm-hmm. And then, my mom, my mom, she's actually not in a great shape. She's got diabetes type two. She's got hypertension, um, she's got, gosh, what is it, ohh, yeah, she's got high cholesterol, um, and I think that's it for her. Yeah. Yeah, right. Any neurological conditions in the family? Uh. there are related conditions. No, OK, that's fine. OK, so, right. So after, you know, speaking and examining, you know, yourself, I think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further. I'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the boxing here. OK, few things that's, made me think other than, just like a boxing injury, is for instance, um, you know, when you said you can't, your vision went, your peripheral vision was not there for about twenty. So, and that with the weakness of the arms, make me think, is there something else going on rather than just an injury? OK. What do you think may be going on? sometimes you know you do get things like MS, multiple sclerosis. So people with multiple sclerosis can have, um, visual problems, like what you've experienced and sometimes you know the odd numbness tingling sensations going on. OK? Ohh! Ohh my God! Will I be in a wheelchair? We, if we capture it a bit early there are treatments for it. OK? I'm not, obviously I'm not suggesting that you do have it, but it is quite important to find out that, whether you have it or not that's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be, uh, dealt with here. Yeah. So, what we can do is I'm going to do an urgent, very urgent neurology referral. Yeah? What they, what that might entail is the brain scan and things like that. Hello? K, OK. OK I see. Yeah yeah yeah! Yeah, I'm here, I'm here. I know this might sound a bit of a shock to you, um, but I'm, I think it is more important that we investigate this a bit more seriously. Yeah. Alright. Yeah, that makes sense. OK. Any questions at all? Well, what's, OK, so you're gonna do the referral, um, should I be taking any drugs or, um No, that's something we can't do. The treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that, uh, when you have an acute you know, acute reaction or things like that. But, saying that, first we need to firm diagnosis. Yeah. While you're waiting for this to be done, if there's any weakness, uh, you know, if the weakness progresses to your legs, or there's any kind of headaches, vomiting, fits, and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better, then that would be an A and E. Mm hmm, yes, OK. OK, got it. Alright. Sounds good! OK, thank you, doctor. Yeah. I'm I'm sorry. I, I do appreciate you are a bit worried, but, you know, it's good that we know that you've come and spoken to us today, and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling. OK? Thank you, doctor. Appreciate your time. That's OK. You take care. Thank you. Bye bye! Good bye now, bye.",

Any neck pain at all? No, no neck pain. Neck pain at all. Okay, right. Okay, so just a bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system. Do you have any past medical history that you'd like to share? Well, I guess because of this, you know, I'm not sure if it's boxing. I also had a really bad cold like a month ago. I mean, I was out, you know, drinking with friends. One of our coworkers just had his three year anniversary and we kind of went crazy and we were out partying until late hours and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me. And then after that I was sick for probably good two weeks, I was at home, I think I must have had some kind of a flu or something. So that, and then I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago is I all of a sudden just couldn't see from the from my left eye. Like I lost some like a little bit of a field of vision. And but that that just lasted not very long. I mean, that just lasted maybe for I don't know, twenty, twenty minutes. And I kind of thought, I don't know, maybe it was the cold, you know, and the virus and all that. So I guess that's what I can you know, that's the last thing I can remember. But in general, I'm pretty healthy. I mean, I you know, I work out a lot, and I don't really have any medical problems. Do you have any headaches at all in the recent past? Sometimes I get headaches, but I think they're just tired headaches. Sometimes I'll get tired, but I think that's probably because I work too much, or because I'll go for a workout, and then I'll really just exhaust myself, and then I just feel this fatigue. this fatigue. Or sometimes like this morning for example I just felt really fatigued and I couldn't even get myself to the gym. But you know since I have this numbness it's kind of like hard to work out right? Do you wear glasses at all? Yeah glasses, contact lenses? No. No so no glasses. Right. And you've not had experienced anything like a seizure, fit, anything like that? What's a seizure? Like when you lose consciousness and you start shaking. Oh no, no, no, no, nothing like that. No fits, yeah, okay. And your weakness is only in your left arm, legs, walking and all this normal, yeah? Yeah, walking is normal, yeah. You mentioned for a while you couldn't see the outside peripheral vision from your left eye. How long did that episode last for? I think it was only maybe like twenty minutes or so. It's almost like it happened and I thought, oh my god, it's probably I'm still like sick from this virus thing, cold. And so I just kind of slept it off and then when I woke up it was gone. Sure, okay. Okay, so is there any regular medications that you're using? Not really. I just take ibuprofen every once in a while. I take vitamin D. I take some, like my GP really wants me to take iron supplements, but you know, there are these like huge pills, so I most of the time I just forget. But vitamin D I take and then sometimes I take melatonin to help me sleep. Okay. All right. And any family history you'd like to share? Any significant family history? I know that my dad has, I don't know if it's hypo, I think it's hypothyroidism. Yeah. And then my, like he's got some autoimmune stuff going on. Like that much I know. And then my mom, my mom, she's actually not in a great shape. She's got diabetes type two. She's got hypertension. She's got gosh, what is it? Oh, yeah. She's got high cholesterol. And I think that's it for her. Yeah. Right. Any neurological conditions in the family? They have related conditions. Okay. That's fine. Okay. so after speaking and examining yourself on this, I think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further. I'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the boxing here. A few things that's made me think other than just like a boxing injury is, for instance, when you can't, your vision went, the peripheral vision was not there for about twenty. So and that with the weakness of the arms make me think, is there something else going on rather than just an injury? What do you think may be going on? Sometimes, you know, you do get things like MS, multiple sclerosis. So people with multiple sclerosis can have visual problems like what you've experienced and sometimes, you know, the odd numbness, tingling sensations going on. Oh my God. Well, I mean wheelchair? If we catch it a bit early, there are treatments for it. Okay. I'm not obviously I'm not suggesting that you do have it, but it is quite important to find out that whether you have it or not. That's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be dealt with here. Yeah? So what we'll do is I'm going to do an urgent, very urgent neurology referral. Yeah? What they what that might entail is the brain scan and things like that. Hello? I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm here. I'm here. I know this might sound a bit of a shock to you, but I think it is important that we investigate this a bit more seriously. All right. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, any questions at all? Well, what's okay, so you're going to do the referral. Should I be taking any drugs? No, that's something we can't do. The treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that when you have an acute reaction or things like that. But saying that first we need to a firm diagnosis. Yeah? While you're waiting for this to be done, if there's any weakness, if the weakness progresses to your legs or there's any kind of headaches, vomiting, fits, and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better, then that would be an A and E. Okay, got it. All right. Okay, thank you doctor. Yeah, I'm sorry, I do appreciate you are a bit worried, but you know, it's good that you've come and spoken to us today and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling. Okay? Thank you, doctor. Appreciate your time. That's okay. You take care. Bye bye. Bye now."

Can I please confirm your full name and date of birth? Uh my name is, Tracy Chapman, and, um, my date of birth is. God . , I'm forty five. Just tell me how old you are. , OK.

Yeah, yeah, feeling very sort of breathless recently. Um, like, I don't know, whenever I like breathe deeply, I, it sort of catches in, in the, right-hand side of my back. Right, OK, OK. And how long has this been going on for now? Just, just today really. Right, OK. Any other symptoms at the same time, uh, that you've had this pain? Um, well I've had a , I've got a bit of slight fever, um, and, and, uh, well like, I coughed up a bit of blood on, on two occasions. Right, OK. what that means. OK, all right. , well it might, it might all be connected then. Um, and um, yesterday, before this, all of this, were you completely fine? Um, yeah, yeah, kind of, I , I, I can sort of feel my heart beating, but , other than that, no, sort of fine. OK. So you can feel your heart kind of, um, beating a little bit, bit faster, do you think than normal? Is that? , I don't know I can just sort of feel it, more , you know. Um, but I've, I've also, I've been feeling a bit, like a bit tired at work. OK. Sure. Haven't really been, like exercising has been a bit difficult, because I've been feeling tired. Um, and, , yeah performing, , performing daily activities has, has been a bit harder than usual. . OK, all right. , and um, how long has that been for? The tiredness and, you know, , not wanting to exercise and. Um, , only after, only for a couple of weeks or so. Couple of weeks, OK. And then, and the last day or so that's when you get the cough and the pain in the side? And you've cough blood, OK, all right. Um, you said you felt a bit warm. , have you measured your temperature at all? Yep. Um, with the back of my, my hand, yes. just with that, OK, fair enough, all right. Um, OK. And now, can I just ask? Um, do you smoke at all? Uh, no. OK. What do you work as? Um, I work in an office, just a, desk job. OK, all right. And, um, do you live alone? Uh, yes. Yeah. In a flat or a house? Flat. OK. Do you have any pets? Cat. A cat, OK. Um, uh, uh, are you on, any medication at all? Regular medication? Uh, yeah, um, , Methotrexate, Methotrexate, that's. Methotrexate. OK. , what are you on that for? Um, I've, I've got SLE. SLE, OK. Do you have any other , diagnoses? Any other illnesses at all? No. Right, OK. Um, and do you have any allergies to any medication? No. Any other allergies at all? No. OK. So, um, you're on, you're taking Methotrexate at the moment. When was the last time you had Methotrexate? Uh, this morning. Ohh, you had it this morning. OK, ohh right, all right. OK. Um , um, couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and um, get an idea of how, unwell you are. OK. Um, the first thing I'd like to do, is to try and measure your pulse. So, what, the way we're gonna do this, is that, if you're, if I can get you to try and locate the pulse in your wrist. . Not everyone can do this, so don't worry if you can't. But if you, if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse. It's just under the thumb. If you put two fingers up and down like that, you might be able to feel the pulse. I've got it. You got it, OK. Are you sure? Yep. All right. So what I'm going to do, is I'm going to tell you when to start counting, and when to stop counting OK. So I'll just get my stopwatch up. OK. So if you can, um, you've still got the pulse? Yep. OK. So if you can start counting, now please. One, two, three. Five, six, , eight, , ten, . If you can stop now, . That, I think that was about eleven or twelve. Um, so that would make your heart rate about, sixty six to seventy four, that's, that's OK, good. Fantastic. And the next thing I'd like you to try and do, OK. Um, it depends on the lighting, so it may not be possible. But the next thing I'd like you to try and do is just, to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger. And then let me see how quickly the redness come back. OK, so if you can see what I'm doing now. My finger's come, right behind the screen, I'm squeezing it, OK. , just watch me first, it's all right, just watch me first. Yeah, I'm, I'm squeezing it. And then you can see, that, it goes, pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour, OK. So if I can get you just to put your finger up to the, your camera. And then with the other hand, just try and squeeze it, and see. You look like you've got very good circulation. OK, perfect, that's great. Thank you so much. The last thing I'd like to do, is I'd like , to , try and have a look down your throat. OK. Are, are you doing this consultation via, um, a phone or a , laptop? Phone. A phone? rested it on my laptop, so I think we're good to go. , sorry, say that again. Got it rested the laptop but I can. OK, , OK. So if you, if you, um, position your device up above your head, put your head back, mouth open wide, and let me see if I can have a . That's, fantastic. And say ah. Ah. Perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent. Lovely. OK. Last thing, is if I can get you to feel inside your neck. Just on the sides here, OK, um, by your Adam's apple. Tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not. No, they feel pretty normal to me. . OK. I think. All right. Um. Now, um, uh, . Sorry, I've forgotten your name. Um, Doris. Doris, OK Doris. Um, so, so Doris, um, what, what I think we need to do, is um. This sounds like you might have a chest infection. OK. If you're coughing up blood, and you're feeling your heart racing. Um. Uh, I think, you need to be examined today, someone needs to listen to your chest. And, um, maybe check your blood pressure as well, check that, you're stable. I have to say examining you now, from what limited, examination I could do online. You're, everything does seem to be OK, in terms of, you, you don't seem acutely unstable. However, if you've got, this kind of pain, um, when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood. We do, do, we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a Pneumonia or chest infection. And um, that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope, and you may need um, an antibiotic. Uh, there's one thing I need to ask you. Have you been, on any long-haul flight recently? No, no. No, OK. Have you ever had any clots in your legs, or clots in your lung? Blood clots? Not that I know of, no. No, OK. Anyone in the family have that? No. No, OK. All right. Um, what I think we'll do is um, we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today. OK. Um, I would like someone to listen to your chest, and check your blood pressure. And to, to recheck your pulse as well. Just make sure, and check your temperature, make sure all those parameters are OK. You may well need an antibiotic, OK. Um, do you have any allergies to any antibiotics? No. No, OK. Um, I, I'm not, I'm gonna, not, I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now, because I think you need to have that, basic assessment first. Um, before we proceed to the next step. But the, that's what I would predict the next step might be. Um, I'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment, for you to ring our support team. And then, they will, book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs today. And then, they'll do that assessment, and then we'll take it from there, OK. OK. But we don't think I'm dying of lung cancer. Um, uh, given the, the way in which you uh, have presented now. Just one day, with a fever and, this slight pain, , concurrent with the, the blood in the, the, the flem. That's not usually how lung cancer is presented. It's more insidious, over a longer period of time, with other symptoms. Um, however, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding, when we see you. OK. All right. , are you worried about lung cancer? Well you know, you start coughing up blood and you think you're, gonna, die of lung cancer, so. . Sure, of course yeah. So, just remind me how old you are again. I'm sorry. Forty five. Forty five, OK. It's something we do need to be cognisant of, OK. Um, and, we may end up having to do a follow-up chest X-ray, if things don't settle down. But at the moment, it, it seems more like a chest infection, rather than a lung cancer. That's good to know. Yeah, that, that is good to know, yeah, so that's, 'cause that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are OK because, chest infections can become nasty as well. It can lead to infection inside the body, , we want to avoid that as well. So, let's get you checked out today, and hopefully we can put your mind to rest, and get you on the right course of treatment. Yep. Perfect. Thank you very much. All right, you're welcome. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye.",

Okay, so before we start your appointment, could I please confirm your full name and date of birth? My name is Tracy Chaplin and my date of birth is God. Just tell me how old you are. I'm forty five. Okay, and could you confirm the first line of your address and your postcode? fifteen Babylon Street, W six five. Desperately. Okay, thank you. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yes. Okay, fantastic. All right, so tell me what's been going on. You said you were a bit short of breath, is that right? Yeah, yeah, feeling very sort of breathless recently. I don't know, whenever I breathe deeply, it sort of catches in the right hand side of my back. Right, okay, okay. And how long has this been going on for now? Just a day really. Right, okay. Any other symptoms at the same time that you've had this pain? Well, I've got a bit of a slight fever and I coughed up a bit of blood on two occasions. Right, okay. I'm sure what that means. Okay, all right, we might, it might all be connected then. And yesterday before this all of this, were you completely fine? Yeah, yeah, kind of. I sort of feel my heart beating, but other than that, no, sort of fine. Okay, so you can feel your heart kind of beating a bit faster, you think, than normal? I don't know, I can just sort of feel it. Sure. But I've also, I've been feeling a bit like a bit tired at work. Haven't really been like exercising has been a bit difficult because I've been feeling tired and yeah, performing daily activities has been a bit harder than usual. Okay, all right. And how long has that been for the tiredness and not wanting to exercise? Only after, only for a couple of weeks or so. A couple of weeks. Okay. And then the last day or so, that's when you get the cough and the pain in the side and you've coughed blood. Okay. All right. You said you felt a bit warm. Have you measured your temperature at all? With the back of my hand. Just fill up with that. Okay. Full enough. All right. Okay. Okay, now can I just ask, do you smoke at all? No. What do you work as? I work in an office, just a desk job. Okay, all right. And do you live alone? Yes. Yeah, in a flat or a house? Flat. Okay, do you have any pets? Cats. A cat, okay. Are you on any medication at all, regular medication? Yeah, methotrexate, methotrexate. Methotrexate, okay. What are you on that for? I've got SLE. SLE, okay. Do you have any other diagnoses, any other illnesses at all? No. Right, okay. And do you have any allergies to any medication? No. Any other allergies at all? No. Okay. So you're on you're taking Methotrexate at the moment. When was the last time you had Methotrexate? This morning. Oh, you had me this morning. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. A couple things I'd like to do in order to try and get an idea of how unwell you are. Okay. The first thing I'd like to do is to try and measure your pulse. So the way we're going to do this is that if I can get you to try and locate the pulse on your wrist, not everyone can do this so don't worry if you can't. But if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse, it's just under the thumb. If you put your fingers up and down like that you might be able to feel the pulse. I've got it. You've got it, okay. Are you sure? Yeah. All right, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting. Okay. So I'll just get my stopwatch up. Okay. So if you can, you've still got the pulse? Yeah. Okay. So if you can start counting now please. One, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, seven. If you can stop now, I think that was about eleven or twelve. So that would make your heart rate about sixty six to seventy four. That's okay, good. Fantastic. And the next thing I'd like you to try and do, okay, it depends on the lighting, so it may not be possible. But next thing I'd like to try and do is just to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger and then let me see how quickly the redness comes back. Okay, so if you can see what I'm doing now, my fingers come right behind the screen. I'm squeezing it. Just watch me first. Just watch me first. I'm squeezing it and then you can see that it goes pale and then it goes back to the normal red color. So if I can get you just to put your finger up to your camera and then with the other hand just try and squeeze it. You've got a very good circulation. Okay, perfect. That's great. Thank you so much. The last thing I'd like to do is I'd like to try and have a look down your throat. Okay. Are you doing this consultation via a phone or a laptop? Phone. A phone. I've restored it on my laptop, so I think we're good to go. Sorry, say that again. I've got a rest of my laptop. Okay. So if you position your device up above your head, put your head back, mouth open wide, and let me see if I can have that. That's perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent. Lovely. Okay. Last thing is if I can get you to feel inside your neck, just on the sides here, okay, by your Adam's apple, tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not. No, they feel pretty normal to me. Okay. I think. All right. Now, sorry, I've forgotten your name. Doris. Doris, okay, Doris. So, Doris, what I think we need to do is this sounds like you might have a chest infection, okay? If you're coughing up blood and you're feeling your heart racing, I think you need to be examined today. Someone needs to listen to your chest and maybe check your blood pressure as well and check that you're stable. I have to say examining you now from what limited examination I could do online, everything does seem to be okay in terms of you don't seem acutely unstable. However, if you've got this kind of pain when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood, we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a pneumonia or chest infection and that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope and you may need an antibiotic. There's one thing I need to ask you. Have you been on any long haul flight recently? No. No. Okay. Have you ever had any clots in your legs or clots in your lung? Blood clots? Not that I know of, no. Anyone in the family have that? No. Okay. All right. What I think we'll do is we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today. I would like someone to listen to your chest and to check your blood pressure and to recheck your pulse as well. Just check your temperature. Make sure all those parameters are okay. You may well need an antibiotic. Okay. Do you have any allergies to any antibiotics? No. No, okay. I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now because I think you need to have that basic assessment first before we proceed to the next step. But that's what I would predict the next step might be. I'm going to leave a number in the notes for this appointment for you to ring our support team and then they will book you in for a face to face appointment with one of our GPs today. And then they'll do that assessment and then we'll take it from there. Okay? But we don't think I'm dying of lung cancer. Given the way in which you have presented now, just one day with a fever and this slight pain concurrent with the blood and the phlegm, that's not usually how lung cancers present. They're more insidious over a longer period of time with other symptoms. However, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding when we see you. Okay. All right. Are you worried about lung cancer? Well, you know, you start coughing up blood and you think you're going to die of lung cancer. Sure. Of course, yeah. So just remind me how old you are again, I'm sorry. forty five. forty five. Okay. It's something we do need to be cognizant of, okay? And we may end up having to do a follow up chest x ray if things don't settle down. But at the moment, it seems more like a chest infection rather than a lung cancer. That's good to know. That is good to know, yes, because that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are okay because chest infections can become nasty as well, and can lead to infections inside the body. We want to avoid that as well. So let's get you checked out today and hopefully we can put your mind to rest and get you on the right course of treatment. Perfect, thank you very much. All right, you're welcome. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye."

So, um, how can i help today? Yeah, um. So basically it's, just been happening over the last few weeks or so. But I don't really feel like um, like, getting up in the morning's really difficult, and I don't have much energy at all, during the day, um. Often. Yeah just like, doing most things that I would normally find, easy , is become quite difficult. OK. So, things have become quite difficult for you. Yeah. Is there anything else? Um, no it's quite hard to say like. Things like, I'm not, I'm not eating very much at the moment. I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy. OK. I'm sorry to hear that. Um, so you had difficulty waking up. No energy, not eating. And that's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks, do you mean two or three or five? how many hours of sleep? Actually, well, now I kind of think about it maybe, maybe even longer, um. I guess uh, , might be related to, so I also started a new job, um, slightly recently. Um. It might of even coincided, coincided with uh, with that, job, a couple of months ago. When did you start your new job? Two months ago, did you say? Yeah. OK. And, um, so this has been going on perhaps for um, sort of, six weeks or so? More like, , two months, I would say, yeah. OK. Alright. So, um, Is there anything that you're particularly, sort of concerned about, um, or hoping to get out of this consultation? Well, um, I, I know that it's not really normal for me, so, before this phase. So I'd have thing, you know I wouldn't have, uh, any problems sort of. , eating, what I want to eat, or you know, doing standard things in life, and, and, what I want, to do is just like, kind of return to that previous state. Uh, somehow. Um, I'm not sure how that is. Uh, what, what the best ways of doing that are, but, yeah. Do you have some advice or? Whatever, that'd be really useful. OK. Sure. OK. Um, well what would I like to do is just ask you a few more, sort of questions around what's been going on, um, and also around your background health and um, and things like that. And then we can go on to sort of what can be done from there. Is that alright? OK. OK, great. so you say you've been, um, feeling unwell with not a lot of energy, difficult waking up in the mornings. Do you tend to just on that , do you tend to wake up early, and then stay in bed in the morning? Um, actually I'm, just uh, not, not really waking up early. It's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all, really. I think that's probably closer. , difficulty sleeping as well. Yeah. Um, and have you, and, how, how has your mood been over this period? Have you been feeling your usual self? Um. Distracted, , I'd say. Uh, I, I kind of, um. Yeah, uh, finding it really hard to, quite, difficult to keep focusing, I would say. Um, not unhappy or, happy, but just uh, quite, just , not focused. OK. So difficulty focusing, quite distracted. And, would you say you've been in good spirits? Or is your mood low? Um. Actually uh, now you, you, you mention it like, my, mood is a bit lower recently. Um, and so I've noticed like, uh, my sex drive has kind of decreased, um, a bit over the, the past few months as well, so, yeah. Right. K. And uh, so lower mood, decreased sex drive recently as well. And, just on that note, just a few questions around that. Are you able to, uh, it may be slightly personal questions, but if you're O. O. K. to answer this, Do you tend to, to have morning erections like you, is that something that you've noticed, ? Yeah. Um, I haven't noticed anything like that, specifically, no. So, you've not, so you're saying you have not noticed morning erections, and usually you would. So, normal thing to have, uh, waking up in the morning with something. But you have not noticed those recently. Yes. I have not noticed those recently. OK. So, and that's been a change, has it? Um. Important one I don't think, um, yeah. Not, I don't think it's important to change, no. Sorry? Uh, so you, you, you, you don't think there's been a change there. You No, there hasn't been a change there. Ohh OK, sorry. Right, so OK. So, um, Just going back to the mood symptoms as well. Uh, you have had uh, difficulty focusing, easily distracted. Your mood has been uh, slightly lower, with lower sex drive. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and in what way has your sex drive been lower? are you in a relationship at the moment? Yeah, I, I'm married, um, have been for, many years. Mm-hmm. And, uh, yeah just, um. Over the last few months, just uh, been disinterested. Disinterested. OK. OK. Sorry, you froze there for a moment. Um, . So less interested as well, OK. Yeah. And, just to ask you a few questions before we uh, wrap up is, uh, any significant past medical history? Um, so do you suffer from any, uh, mental health problems in the past, or any, uh, physical health problems? Um, so, in the past, um, I have a, a history of, hypothyroidism, um. Hypo? Hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroid. Yeah. K, so that's high thyroid, just to sort of confirm that. Um. Sorry, can you say that again please? hyper, as in high, hyperthyroid. Hypo. Hypo, OK. Hypothyroid. Thank you. Thank you. Um. Yeah, and uh, also in the past, I mean, I haven't had any kind of specific, uh, medical diagnoses, along these lines. OK. Um, but the suspicion, that it may have uh, had an impact on me, but my father has commited suicide, um, about fifteen years ago. OK. OK. And um, Uh, do you take any medications? I had a, a, drug history of Thyroxine. Mm-hmm. So, maybe, yes. Do you, do you continue to take Thyrocsin now? Yes. You do. You're, so you're taking Thyrocsin at the moment? Um. Yes. Cool. And any drug allergies? Are you allergic to any medications? No, I have no uh, medication allergies, no. No. No allergies. And you mentioned the , the suicide of your father fifteen years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other, um, uh, significant family history of medical conditions, or psychiatric conditions? No. No depression or anything like that running in your family, or uh, Uh, nothing, nothing, that sort. OK. And your mother is, is well? Any brothers or sisters? Yeah she's fine, um, and no, I'm an only child. Um. Um, OK. So, I just uh, uh, sorry it might seem like a slightly random question, but any uh, change in vision? No No, no, nothing like that. . OK. And, just to go back to your, you were saying you had low mood. Some people who , who do have low mood, uh, and low sex drive can sometimes feel uh, suicidal as well. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else? No. No. No, not , not really, no. and are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities, that you have done in the past? Sometimes, I mean, I guess, um, most of the activites, but, when I've been doing sports as well, , I find sometimes it's quite difficult to breathe, um. So, I have some kind of like, shortness of breath um, when doing, sports, compared to maybe a couple of months ago. OK. So you, you've become more short of breath over the last few months. Yeah. Um, and you've had a OK. So uh, any other things around that? So, more fatigue, more shortness of breath, um, over the last few months? Mmm. Um, with a low, lower mood, decreased sex drive. Um, is there, just before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like to talk about? Um, no, nothing specific, no. So, um, We're getting a little bit towards the end now, but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you. Um, I would like to, probably see you in person, and do an examination. And, and also, we would probably like to do some blood tests um, as well. So, do you think it would be possible to see uh, to to book an appointment in the next few days uh, with your GP? Or, or um, that would be ideal, I think here. Um, and then we can, we can probably do some more uh, we'll do an examination and uh, do some investigations really, to see what's going on here a little bit more. , yes. That makes sense, yeah. Is that alright? Yeah, that's very useful, thank you, um. OK. Yeah, it feels, better to have some kind of plan, uh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think , I definitely think we need a plan here. Um, it's been nice talking to you. I'm sorry, we've run out of time now. Uh, but we've at least started the ball rolling with um, some further investigations and tests. I'm glad you're, you know, you're, you're , you're, although you have a low mood, um, you're, you're, um, you're not feeling suicidal, just to confirm that. Mm-hmm, yes.

And do you normally take any asthma inhalers over the last few years? Yes, yeah. You do? So you said you stopped them three to four years ago? Ohh, um, when I had asthma I used to take this inhaler, yeah. OK. How about over the last three to four years? Yeah. Have you taken any medication? Um, I took salbutamol? Salbutamol? Yeah. OK, so you, you normally take that do you? Or is that just recently? Normally, yeah. OK, and how often do you normally need it? Every, every few weeks? I'm not sure. OK. What about when you exercise normally, do you have to use medication? Uh, inhalers? Yeah, yeah, a bit. Pardon? Yeah. OK, um, and do you take any other medications? No, nothing else. Any other medical problems? Uh, I have, uh, hay fever as well. OK, do you take anything for that? No. And any allergies to medications? No, no allergies. Do you smoke? No, I don't smoke. Do you drink any alcohol regularly? Yeah, one glass. How often? Have a glass of what? Today, yeah. Uh, one glass of wine. Every, how often did you say? Every two or three days? Depends, yeah. And who do you live with at home? Yeah. Who do you live with at home? Yeah, . Who do you live with, do you live on your own, or do you live with I live with my partner. OK, and what's your job, day-to-day? Uh, I'm engineer. And have you been at work in the last few days? No I can't because I used to walk walk to work, but recently I, I work from home or sometimes I take sick leave, yeah. OK, and when, at the moment, are you, um, feeling short of breath when you're sitting still? Or just when you walk? No. Just walk or sometimes, but currently I feel, I feel well. Are you able to get up and down the stairs OK? Yeah. Right, OK. Um, and did you say you were finding it hard to complete your sentences? Yeah, sometimes. OK, um. Yeah, , days, yeah. Right, OK. Um, I mean, it sounds like you've had a flare up of your asthma. It could be, um, triggered by, if there's more pollen around, or there may be, you may have a viral infection, causing it to get worse. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Did you say you checked your temperature already? Yes, I checked, I have fever . Was it normal? Yeah, yeah. What was your temperature? Uh, thirty seven, yeah. OK, that's fine. Um, have you got an asthma inhaler at home? Yeah. OK. So what I would suggest is you take it more regularly than you are doing at the moment. Have you got, um, a spacer at home? Mm-hmm. Um, do you want to show me how to do it or somehow? Um, do you have a spacer at home? No. OK. Um, what I can do is, I can prescribe you a peak flow meter so we can check your breathing level and a spacer to use your inhaler a bit more efficiently, which the pharmacist can show you how you use that when you pick it up. Yeah, sure. Um, and if you increase it so you're taking it two to four puffs, like, every four hours? Mm-hmm. Initially, um, if you get a high temperature or your wheezing is getting worse, you need to call us back straightaway so we can just advise you further with that. OK. And it will be a good idea when you're feeling better if we can arrange just a review, just to see how your asthma is, because we may need to start some other medication for you. OK, sounds good, yeah. You could arrange a review in a week or so, um, but, but before that and if you're, if you're feeling worse. In a week, right? OK. OK, and the other thing to do would be to take a regular antihistamine. Mm-hmm. Which you can get from the pharmacy, I can put a on your notes about what to take. Yeah. Yeah, they'll be helpful. And then if you, when you get the peak flow meter, if you can take, the pharmacist can show you how to use it, and if you can record a value first thing when you wake up. Mm-hmm. And in the evening over the next week, and then we can discuss that over the phone when we look at the figures and see whether you need to go on another inhaler as well. Oh, awesome, thank you. Have you got any questions? Um, no, that's fine, yeah, thank you very much. Thanks a lot, bye.",

      "reference_text": "Hi, good morning! Hello there! Hi there, this is uh this is Doctor Dean from . Hello there? Um, I'm wondering if you can help me today. OK, sure, I'll try. Before we start, could I please confirm your full name and date of birth? Yes, it's Sarah Smith, and it's the second of November, um, nineteen ninety two. That's great! Thank you, sir. So are you in a private place where you are OK to speak at the moment? I am indeed, yes. OK, so tell me what's been going on. OK. I, I've really not been feeling so well at all recently. I, I've been struggling with fever for the past week. Yeah, I would say it's about seven days ago. I'm just, I'm really hot and sweaty all the time, and just generally not feeling good. OK, alright, sorry to hear that. Now, um, uh, along with this fever and this any other symptoms at all? Um, I'd say that I'm aching all over really, my muscles are really aching. I'm feeling quite nauseous, uh, so I've not been able to eat very much, and I have been drinking but it's been quite a small amount. Um, and, yeah, just generally quite tired and unwell. I'm sweating during the the the night, I'm quite cold. OK, all right. Um, and um, so you're having periods of when you're feeling hot, and also periods when you're feeling cold as well. Yes, yes, quite interchangeable, not really a pattern to it. OK, uh, and have you been taking your medication? Uh, I've been trying to, like, take ibuprofen and paracetamol just to from over the counter, but it's not really helping, just been taking the recommended dose every day of those. Sure, and when you say it's not helping, is it bringing the temperature down at all? Perhaps slightly, yes, but I'm still experiencing these symptoms, so, it does take the edge off a bit. OK, alright. And can I just double check have you gotten any cough or cold or sore throat or anything like that? Mmm, not those sort of symptoms, really. Um But which are you getting, other than the ones you've already mentioned to me? Um, so, I have a habit that it's mainly just the sweating, really, and the and the nausea, uh, that's overtaking all all day and, uh, the aching muscles all over. Sure. Have you have you had any ear pain ? Mmm, no, my ears are fine, actually. I haven't had any problems with my ears. OK, um, just, I just need to check for any other causes of infection in the body. So I'm gonna go through some, um, kind of systemic questions. Have you had any diarrhoea? And not, not really no, not that I can find. OK. Have you got any neck stiffness at all? Um, no. My neck's, my neck's been fine. OK. Alright. Um, do you have any headache? Not more than usual, no. Just like the, general headaches but not, just from staring at the screen. No migraines, or anything. OK. OK, so, you know your normal headache, where is that, in the back of your head or the front of the head? Uum, it's quite centralized over, over the head. OK. and how long have you been having that for? It's something that I've struggled with through, years really, just related to a screen use, or, uum, like changes in weather patterns. Yeah, high pressure days, sometimes I struggle with migraines, and headaches. OK. Um, have you got any rash on your body anywhere at all? Uh, I haven't noticed any rashes, no. Uh, any joints swollen or tender or sore? Mmm, not really. I mean, I, I often have problems with back pain but not really any other joints. OK, alright. Any problems? Alright, and, um, have you got any kind of symptoms down below when you're passing urine? Uh, no, there's been no problems there. OK. Any painful urination at all? Uh, not at all, no. Are you passing urine more often than normal? Uh, I don't think so, no it's been fairly regular. OK. Have you been abroad anywhere recently? Yes, I have actually. Where have you been? I went to Vietnam. Uh, I came back four weeks ago now. OK. Uh, and, um, uh, did you take malaria preventative medication when you went out there? I did, yes. Which one did you take? Ooo, I can't remember now, off the top of my head. Was it a weekly tablet or a daily tablet? I think it was daily. OK, um, and was it one tablet or was it another one that you would take on top of the first one? I think it was, uh another one that I took on top of the first one. OK. And, and what were you doing out in Vietnam? Was it just seeing the cities or going through villages or hiking? What what kind of activities were you doing? It was quite really, 'cause we were there for a few weeks, and we toured to, uh, several different parts of the country, and uh, the countryside and some cities as well. OK. Uh, and um, did you do any kind of, were you in rivers or things like that? Were you, you know, how adventurous were you? I'm sorry, could you repeat that? I missed that. Where you going out into the rivers? Were you going on beaches? I mean how adventurous was your trip? Yes, it was quite adventurous. We were sort of trekking and, um, cycling, uh, through the farmland and, um, seeing how people lived in a day-to-day life in, in, in farmland. Right, OK. Um, thank you for sharing that with me. Now, do you have, um, any other illnesses at all, in the past? Mmm, as I said I've, I've been struggling with back pain for quite a while, but I haven't really had any, uh, major illnesses in the past, I can think of. And that back pain have you, um, have you seen anyone about that? Yes, yeah, I'm under a physiotherapist at the moment for that. Have they, have they give you any kind of diagnosis at all? Um, they've said that it's, u,h related to long periods of time sitting at a desk, and just, uh, bad posture. So mainly the exercises are focused on improving posture and, and to strengthen the muscles in the back. Alright um, are there any illnesses in your family at all? Hmm, the main one would be, um, heart attack. My, my father passed away of that. I'm sorry to hear that. Um, how old was he when that happened? in his sixties. Um, sixty eight, I think. Yeah. OK. Um, are you on any medication at all? Uh, just Seroxat. OK. Uh, do you have any allergies at all? medication? No, I've just really pollen allergy. That's all I have. OK, so hay fever. Yes, yeah, just hay fever. Alright. Um, are you, um, you're working at the moment? Uh, I am, yes. What do you work at? I work as a nurse. OK, all right. Um, and, um, you're up to date with all the vaccinations, Hepatitis B, and that kind of thing? Yes, indeed. Yeah. OK. But I'm, I'm really struggling quite a lot at work at the moment. It's been quite difficult, feeling so, uh, tired all the time. So, I can . Sure, OK. Um, and, are you a, uh, are you a smoker at all? No, I'm not. OK, and ohh do you drink much alcohol? Mmm, moderate alcohol intake. Yeah, I don't drink too much. OK, and how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally? I try and do, uh, some moderate physical exercise a few times a week. OK, that's good, alright, um, so, um What, uh, I think we're gonna need to do is we're gonna need to bring you into one of our clinics. Examine , and we're gonna need to arrange some blood tests as well. OK. OK, um, so, what what I want to do is, the first question I have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this fever and these symptoms, because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me. OK. There's no, uh, when someone has got fever and sweats, we want to find out have they got chest infection, have they got a throat infection? Um, and if we can't find a focus of infection, then that's something, that, that's an outstanding question that needs to be answered, OK? Um, the second thing, second factor, is that you've recently come from, uh, Vietnam. OK. And you've had exposure to rural areas. And we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well. So, um, you're probably gonna need some blood tests. After you've been seen by somebody. Um, now, the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you, which is why we're going to go, go for the examination first. You come into one of our clinics in central London, that's one option, and then the the GP there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be. OK. Or, if it's inconvenient for you to come into central London because you you're living further out, you could actually just attend a local A and E. I'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of test I think you need in the notes for this appointment, so you could show that to them at reception. Um, I'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films, to check for malaria. And inflammatory markers and things like those, technical terms, but they'll understand what that, what I'm talking about. But, um, I, I don't think you can go into work, uh, until we've sorted this out. And we, we, we need to sort this out sooner rather than later. OK. That sounds great. Thank you so much for your help. I, I think, yeah, I can come straight into central London today to get that sorted. OK. OK, fine, so what I'm going to do is I will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in. And if you can ring the number that I leave in your consultation notes, after a few minutes, and then they'll slot you in, and then we can sort things out from there. OK? That's brilliant. Thank you very much. Alright then, OK. Take care then. All the best. Goodbye. Bye.",

OK, uh, you've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea. I'm sorry to hear about it. So if you tell me a bit more about it, please. Uh, it's been happening for about, three days now? Um, yeah it, started off uh, was, I don't know it's just something that I thought would go away pretty quickly. OK. I've had that from time to time after eating certain types of food or going on certain travels, but, uh nothing funky in my diet and no travels recently, um and it just kinda kept up. I'm a bit confused as to what to do . Mmm. Mm-hmm. So you haven't had anything from outside? Nothing dodgy anything ? No. No, no no no, just a little bit, yeah I I don't know I mean it's pretty standard diarrhoea, where it's was like a little bit of abdominal pain. I threw up once, that was a little worrying, uh. Mm-hmm. Repeat that please, that wasn't clear. What did you say? I threw up once, yeah. After that we'd said something. Uh, nothing else was worrisome. OK, right, and with the diarrhea, how many times a day are you going to the toilet? Uh, four to five. Four to five times, yeah. And is there any? And it's like water? Is it like water or is it just loose? Uh, what do you mean? Are you going like water? Or is it just, you know bit, bit of solid stools, bit loose kind of thing? It probably depends on the time of day to be honest, . Sure OK. Bit of both and is there any blood or mucus? No blood. What do you mean mucus? It's like the snotty stuff. In the stool? Yeah, it looks like snot . No. No, so no mucus, OK. Any fever at all? Uh, maybe a little bit, but. Mm-hmm. It hasn't been, that in particular hasn't been too worrying. Are you still able to eat, and drink? Uh, a little bit of. Appetite loss I guess worse than normal, but also not something I've, like I, if that was alone I wouldn't have, reached out. OK. Sure. So but you're you're still able to drink quite a bit yeah? You're drinking plenty. Yeah yeah yeah. OK. Excellent. Mostly it's been dry and red. OK, and, um, what have you take, have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea? Nothing yet. Nothing yet, OK. Anything for the abdominal pain? Uh, nothing yet. OK. Right, and any unfortunately we don't have any of your past medical history, is there anything you'd like to say? Uh, I. Probably I I had asthma. Mm-hmm. Um or, or I don't know I guess I still have it. OK and uh, are you, any, uh, anything else other than asthma? Uh, my dad had hypertension. OK. Has hypertension. Had hypertension. Yeah he died of bowel cancer ten years ago. Yeah . Ohh dear, OK. Bowel cancer. Ten years ago. And how old was he when he died? Uh, sixty-two. K, and um, you mentioned you had asthma, are you using any inhalers at all? Yes. Which ones? Lexapro. Sorry? Lexapro. Laxepro. Yes. OK, not heard of it may. Is it like Salbutamol? Is it like a blue colour? Yellow. Yellow, OK. I'll have to check that one, not sure. Laxepro. OK. Um, that's fine. Any other medication that you're using? Over the counter, anything at all? OK. Right. Any allergies? No. Nothing, yeah, nothing. No allergies at all, righty . Fine so, obviously, you know you just have diarrhea it's about four to five times a day. Um, you're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated which is a good sign, OK? Um, when we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day. That means probably you are, you know, whatever you're eating is going straight through, OK? You still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids. Mmm. OK, when you go to the toilet. Um, things that one would advise is a soft diet. So avoid dairy, fish, meat, eggs, while you're having the diarrhea. Go, sorry? Soft . What is a soft diet? What does that ? Like, outside of, not those things, what do you mean by soft? OK, so that will be like crackers, toast, jam, those kind of things that's easily digested. Like what we are good give babies yeah. When they start eating you give, simple food for babies. You don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding. So that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about, yeah? Once you are able to, you know keep most of it in, you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash. Once you're OK with that for about forty-eight hours then you can start having meat. So just don't have meat once you feel like you're slightly better, because you might go back to square one again, all right? What do you mean OK with that diet, like once? Forty-eight hours you're not having any diarrhea, you're fine then you can go and start having meat, egg, fish and all. So that . OK, if if the diarrhoea is getting better but isn't getting, or do you want it to go away completely at that point, or if it's like trending upwards? No, no, no preferably just don't because, what why do we say this? It's because it takes much more time for meat to get digested. So because your gut flora, you know, the, the, the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be, it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food. While it doesn't take that much of an effort to, you know digest mash and vegetables. Does that make sense? Yes. Yeah? So, um, at the same time you could have some, although you can't milk is not a good idea, yoghurts are a good idea because they are probiotics, it help to build up the normal, um gut, gut bacteria back. OK. OK. So those kinda, now, things to look out for, if your diarrhoea doesn't go away in a week's time, or if you're passing blood, we need a stool sample, because that means you you may have , um, some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics. OK. OK. If you're again, as I've mentioned previously if you're going about six to eight times a day, that means there's a high chance that, uh, you are, having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time. If that happens you get in touch with us again, all right? OK. Any questions? You look a bit confused. No, that's it. Yeah? OK and also you could get something called Dioralyte over the counter. So, it helps to uh, replenish your, the salts that you've been, that's lost through going to the toilet. OK. OK? If you're a bit confused you know you can actually, uh, all this is all recorded in your app. So you can go back. I'll put that all in detail so if, you know I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything, you can go back and read, read the notes. Perfect, that's great. Is that OK? All right then, you take care. Bye. Bye now, bye bye.",

So, it started this morning, was it a sudden onset headache, did it come on suddenly? Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. And did it come on really bad or did it start off, uh, like a slight headache and build up to a, a severe headache? Uh, it came like, kind of suddenly. And if , if ten is the worst pain you've ever felt in your life, how bad would you say the pain was between one and ten? Well, I had the kidney stone, so let's say that that's ten. Um, I have now, , maybe five, well, six, six probably. It's not ten. Great! But, it's more about me being really concerned, because this is very weird. OK. No, that's fine. Have you ever had a headache before? Sorry? Have you ever had a headache like this in the past? Um, well not, really. OK. So, it's a first . Like this, I, yeah, like this, no, definitely.

And tell me what visual problems are you getting? My vision is quite blurred. Um, it, it's, it's really weird, like some zigzag lines. OK. Kind of. I don't know how to describe it properly. OK. And, um, have you tried any painkillers for this already? Yeah, I tried Paracetemol, but uh, didn't work. To be honest, I feel exactly the same. OK. Um, OK. Um, what time did you take the paracetamol? How long ago was it you'd taken it? Uh, well, uh, the headache started like four year, four hours ago.

I feel a little bit, a little bit better. , I cannot stand screens. Um, but, yeah, definitely. And, when I move, like the thing is that if I, if I leave bed, I start to feel like, even worse if I move. So, I just want to have my hay, my head like really, uh, not moving. OK. OK, Um, so, what about, , have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit? Ohh yeah. Ohh, I forgot to mention, definitely, I vomit twice. Actually, as soon as the, the headache started, I also vomited. So, initially, I thought it was something that I ate, but then the headache started to be really bad, and I still feel nausea. Still feel. To be honest, I'm about to vomit, very soon, I think. All right. OK. You've mentioned, in the past, you've had kidney stones, any other medical problems? Sorry? Uh, you've mentioned that in the past, you've had kidney stones. Have you had any other medical problems in the past? Yes. Uh, so, uh, uh, not actually. Uh, my mother has migraines. I'm not sure if that's relevant? And uh, also, I have hypothyroidism in the family. So, it might be. I don't know, uh, I've, I don't know. , what else do you have in the family? I think we are losing connection. Sorry, I, I think we lost connection. Ohh, can you still hear me? Ohh, it's gone. You can hear me. Um, you said, you mentioned your mother has migraines. What else do you have in the family? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroid . She also has Hypothyroidism. OK. Bye. OK. Um, and no other relevant family history? Uh, no, not that I'm aware. And do you take any regular medications? Uh, no. Are you allergic to any medications? Not that I'm aware, uh. Yeah, not that I'm aware. OK. Is there any chance you could be pregnant? Uh, I really doubt it. Fine. And so, you're not allergic to any medications. Fine from. And what, what were you thinking might be going on? I know you seemed quite worried about it. Was there anything in particular you were worried about? Well, I'm a little bit hypochondriac. So, I feel that this can be some kind of brain tumour, tumour or something? Because, I'm like this is, , really, the pain is so horrible that, or maybe a stroke. I don't know, it's, it's just like you know, you hear so many stories. That, you definitely start wonder, if i should go to A and E urgently, because , I might really have something serious. OK. OK, fine. Um, now just, uh, another, uh, question, have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs, anything like that? No, no , no, no. Uh, and when you're walking, you're able to walk fine in a straight line or is your, your uh walk, are you walking a bit funny? Uh, not really. OK. It's really about the head. That's why I find it very weird. OK. So, just, just to clarify what, what you said . This morning, uh, you woke up and then later on in the, in the morning, about four hours ago, you've developed a headache? Um, on the left side of the head? Yep. Yeah. Left side of the head, is it behind the eye? Exactly. Sorry? Is it behind the eye? Is that where the pain is? Uh, no, no it's, ugh, I don't know how to describe it. But it's, just like, , kind of. Um, you've . OK. That's fine. You've noticed that your vision is blurry, there's funny lines, you feel a bit nauseous, you vomited twice. Um, and, uh, you feeling dizzy as well, but your, you've got no neurological symptoms. You're walking fine. Yes. Um, and, and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped. Is that all? OK. No. So, it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine. Is that something you've heard of before? Yeah. Uh. Uh, no, it's the first time. OK. But, to be honest, I'm very familiar with the disease, because my mother has it, so. Uh, well, but I never had it, and I thought that the onset of migraine will be, you know, in much, uh, early ages. So, that's why I'm not sure, if migraine makes sense. . OK. So, um, usually with, with migraines they can present at different times in people's lives, so, sometimes they can present as a child, sometimes they can present when they're older. Um, and sometimes they can present, you know, even postmenopausally. So, there's different, there's different ways you can get migraines. Uh, and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head. typical of a migraine, you've got blurry vision, again which is very typical, with the nausea and vomiting, that's also typical of a migraine. Mm-hmm. Now, um, uh, obviously, if the headache is really severe, and I'll suggest some medications you can try, if that doesn't work, we would want to see you, um, as soon as possible, to do like a full neurological exam as well. to make sure that, you know, there's, you know, when we do a more specific examination that, um, everything all seems fine. Ohh, that's great. Um, I I would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you, uh, if you take some medications, maybe something like ibuprofen? Yeah. OK. So, and, uh, you're, you're saying that if this is a migraine, and if I try that medication. This should go away, kind of, today? So, yes, a migraine, yeah, no, you know, even sooner than that, we can look at maybe half an hour to forty minutes, depending on what your response to it is, for some people, Uh, whatever medications they take the migraine doesn't improve, um, and they can last from anywhere from four hours to seventy two hours, migraines can last. Um, but . Ugh. OK. That doesn't sound good. No. So, what, there's lots of medication treatments so, there's, it can be ibuprofen with an anti-sickness, um, so and , which you can get from the pharmacy. Um, and you also to drink, uh, sugary and carbonated drinks, something like Coke. OK. For the three of them is, uh, is a good sort of cocktail to start them, then we can go up the treatment ladder, you can get specific migraine relief medication. And that should be something to try between now and when we see you to do the, um, to do the assessment. OK. OK. Sounds. assessment to where we can see you today at some point. OK. And, but however, if you do take these medications and, you know, by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself, you can cancel it, um, you can give us a call and cancel it. OK, sounds good, yeah. Sounds, sounds a good plan. OK. Uh, any, any questions for me? Uh, no, thank you very much. You were very helpful. All right. OK. Um, any, any further problems between now and your appointment, please do let us know. OK, yeah. Thank you very much. OK. Bye. Should I disconnect?",

So that, if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer, I can get one. Sure, sure, OK. All right, so, we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms, and I'm sure we can , get a, um, those things, uh, and some reassurance, um, about your concerns. OK.

And is the cough worse at night-time? No, no, it's the same throughout the whole day. Same throughout the day. Um, and, uh, when you say you're short of breath.

Ohh yeah, it's, it's like, so when I'm doing walking. Um, and I do exercises now and then. So it, it hasn't been . Superbad like, hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual, and a little bit worrying. And you're a bit concerned about that, OK. So, I just need to ask a few, uh, things about your background as well. So, um, do you have any other medical conditions, or medical history? No, just, no, no , past medical history, no. No . No history of asthma? No. Um, and any, uh, uh, history of, uh, clots on your legs, or your lungs? So these . Uh, no one in your family's had those? Clots on the legs, or the lungs?

Just lung cancer, from my mother. Just lung cancer. OK. And you say you have a cold. So, do you have , sinus congestion? Or, um. No, it seems to be , entirely with just my throat. So like, my nose is like, . So, , just your, just your throat. And, any recent travel? Or have you always lived in the UK? Uh, no, so I, I, I haven't always lived in the UK. Like, so I was born in the US, and moved over. Well, it was twelve years ago, but, in terms of recent travel. Just to Europe, nowhere too exotic. OK, so no, so no recent travel, no significant recent travel any, anywhere. Um, OK. And, are you coughing up anything other than, . Um, uh, so you, you're not coughing up blood, or anything like that? No, no. Um, good. And, uh, are you feeling feverish, hot, cold, sweaty? Yeah, so, a little bit feverish, uh, um, at first. So the first three or so days of this, but then it, the fever's gone away. OK. And in general, do you . Sorry? Yeah. Yeah, I was just gonna say, also had a bit of a headache. But like, headaches that come and go rather, but like, right now it's fine. Uh. OK. And in general, would you say you're feeling, you're, you're beginning to, to feel better? Worse? Or, or sort of, um, staying the same? , so it's like, it's up and down. So, so let's see, so I, , it started last week, and I stayed home from work two days this week. I think it was maybe, Tuesday and then Thursday. So like, I felt better and then worse again, and then better and then worse again. So it's been, yeah, a kind of constant, but constant and being, variable, if that makes . OK. And I just , need to ask any, other sort of risk factors. Um. That you may have. So, , um, no sort of significant weight loss? Um, or unexplained weight loss? Any ? So no weight loss, but I have been, have been losing my appetite recently. And I mean, I usually eat a lot so, and I, and I enjoy eating as well, but like, so that's been a bit concerning. You've been losing your appetite recently? Yes.

No. Not . Not that, not that you can think of. OK. Um. So, I would ask to examine you now, but um, I, I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat, at least. To see if there's a, probably, there's. Ohh, we can try . Ohh no, well, no, it's OK, I , might think about doing a. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck? That you can feel? Uh. No. No that you, no, OK. Um. And, so finally, you, you were talking about, uh, . I mean, it sounds to me that, um, you've been a little bit up and down. Sore throat. Developed a dry cough. Um, you are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of consultation now, . If you feel significantly worse . Mm-hmm. Um. Uh, if you get more short of breath, or sudden change in your breathlessness. Um, or breathlessness that you are concerned about. Then I would advise you to see, no , go and see a GP. Um, and actually see somebody physically. Um, uh, but I think, for now I can sort of, uh, try and reassure you that, um, if this clears up, as I expect it would. So, I expect this to sort of be getting better in the next, four or five days. Um, if it's not, please get in touch with a medical professional again. Um, and, uh, I would expect it to, and so therefore, I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis Um, your concerns about lung cancer, are. And, was that the other thing you're concerned about? Ohh yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so, um, again, if you're not getting better, please see somebody again. Um, I've just got four seconds now. So, nice talking to you. And, have we gotta? We gotta, tidy up, yeah. OK, so, uh. All right. Uh, and I'll provide you with a sick note, just to give you a few more days off work. Um, and paracetemol. Lots of fluids. Um, and, uh, rest up.

And so finally, you were talking about I mean, it sounds to me that you've been a little bit up and down, sore throat, developed a dry cough. You are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of the consultation now is if you feel significantly worse, if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness or breathlessness that you are concerned about, then I would advise you to seek medical attention again, see a GP and actually see somebody physically. But I think for now I can sort of try and reassure you that if this clears up, as I expect it would, so I expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days. If it's not, please get in touch with the medical professional again. And I would expect it too, and so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis. Your concerns about lung cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer better, please see somebody again. I've just got four seconds now. So nice talking to you. And we gotta tidy up. Okay, so, and I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days off work, and paracetamol, lots of fluids, and rest up, and as I say, if you're not feeling better, please get in touch. Okay? All right, that's a lot. Have a good day. Thank you."

Um, before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth please? Uh yeah, uh Jack Smith, uh thirty first October nineteen ninety. That's perfect, thank you, John. Um, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment? I am, yes OK, great. So, um, tell me what's been going on. You've been saying there's a problem with your hearing. Is that right? Yeah, so I just feel I can't really hear as well as I used to, like my hearing is kind of deteriorating in some way. Right, OK. How long has this been going on for? Uh about six weeks. Six weeks, OK. Um, and before that have you had any hearing problem at all? Um I had something maybe, about a year ago, but it only lasted a couple of days, it wasn't anything as long as this. Right, OK, OK. And, um, in this six week period, have you had anything else happen? Have you had any other ear symptoms at all? Um, I occasionally get like a ringing in my left ear, uh just on the one side and um there's actually been a few times when I felt kind of a bit sick or a bit dizzy as well. Right, OK. Uh, uh, um, just to clarify, the difficulty you've got in hearing, is that both ears or just the left ear? Uh just the left ear, yeah. Alright, so your right ear is fine. It seems be yeah. OK. So you've had ringing, difficulty hearing in your left ear, and feeling slightly sick. Mh-mm. Um, that's been, on and off for the six weeks, or is it continuous there throughout that six weeks? Yeah. Uh it's kind of on and off. Like some things trigger it as well. So, for example, if I'm watching TV or listen to music or something that'll solve the ringing in the ear. Right, OK. Um, and, um, have you had any pain from the ear at all? Uh no my left ear. OK. Any discharge coming out of the ear? No, OK. Um, have, have you been experiencing any fever? Uh, not specifically apart from the dizziness so much. Right, OK. And, um, has your ear been itchy at all? OK. Now, do you use cotton ball buds to try and clean out wax from your ears? Uh nah I'll do it. No, OK. Well, you're right, you should, you shouldn't be doing that. Doesn't clean up wax, it pushes it back in. Alright, um, the first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear. 'K. I'm just exclude the simple things. Simple things might be wax. You know. Someone might have impacted wax, blocking the tube going into the eardrum, which can OK. lead to muffled hearing. Um, if that's the case, that that's something that's easy fixable. But, um, so we need to exclude that first. and then after that, we can consider other potential possibilities. Um, and for that we need to have a look inside the ear drum. So, um, what I think we could do is, um, maybe if we book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics. It's not an emergency. It can be done within the next four, five days or so, OK? And then, um, what I'll do, I'll send a message to our admin team. I'll ask them to slot you into the clinic, one of our clinics in that time frame. You can come in and one of the GPs will just have a quick look in the ear and figure out whether there's physical blockage or whether there's something else going on, OK? Um, can I just double check, the dizziness that you've been getting, um, how severe is it? OK. Yeah. Uh nothing major it's just kind of uh it's, it's not the kind of dizziness you get with nausea, like uh not, not proper room spinning or anything like that but just, just a little bit kind of off balance. Right, right, OK. Have, have you had any chest pain with it? No. No. Any palpitations, heart beating fast? OK, fine, alright. Um, so let's get your ear checked out. I think that will be the, the most sensible thing to do. And then after that, we can, we'll be a step closer to figuring out which way we It might be that there's a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear. But, we just need to exclude whether there's physical blockage first and trying to deal with that if that's the case, OK? Um, but is that the sort of thing that can cause uh like this uh ringing I've got in my ear, 'cause it seems . The ringing that you got, that you've got, it's something called Tinnitus. OK? Um Right. and Tinnitus is something actually that medicine doctors, we don't really understand it fully. We haven't OK. Uh, people can't give you a specific cause for why some patients get Tinnitus and some patients don't. It can be triggered by a wide range of different things, and in fact I'm glad that you've mentioned that. What I might do, in the time between now and when you come for the appointment, I'm going to, uh, put paste the link for a leaflet about Tinnitus, um, in the notes for this appointment. I'd really appreciate it if you could start reading about it. OK. Sure. OK. And often that, that, uh, awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are, and there are limited options um that helps us in terms of conversation about what we do next, if your ear is clear, OK? So, um, I'm going to paste a link to that, um, and you can read about that and what we'll do is we'll see you in about four, five days time. It won't be with me, it'll be another GP but they'll have my notes and they'll know exactly what, what my question is, which is just to check your ears. Is that OK? OK. Yeah it sounds great. Alright, great. So, um, bear with me five minutes and then you can ring the support team, I'll leave the number in the notes for this appointment. Ring them, and then they'll slot you in, OK? OK brilliant. Alright. If there's any problem, any issues between now and when the clinic appointment is, just book another appointment and you can speak to one of us over video, OK? OK.

Um, that, that's all fine and, you know I take a Rennie's if I need to, and if my nose polyps are playing up I've got a spray. Um. Other than that I think they said, ages ago, I had something called, can't quite remember but, labyrinthitis, something like that, but again, nothing, nothing ongoing. Sure. Sure, OK. So, are you on any regular medication? You mentioned the spray for your nose. Yeah, so, no, uh, I only take the, spray for my nose when I need it for, and um, sometimes take like Rennies, but I just get that from the chemist.

Yeah, so I'm a, I'm a jockey, um, but, because of all the kind of, these symptoms I've been getting, especially sometimes when I get a ringing, I can feel a bit dizzy. Ohh, I've just had to do far less training. So, kind of beginning to, yeah, impacting work, um, a little bit now. OK. So you have to excuse my ignorance, you mean, jockey like with horses? Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Alright, OK. Fine. Um, great. Um, uh, and, uh, do you live alone? Yeah, yeah. Um, I, uh, live with my partner. Uh, OK. Right, um, do you have any pets at all at home? No, no pets. OK, fine. OK so, alright. Um, Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what's been going on, recently? Uh, no, just like, like I said, like the ringing um, occasionally and, when I get that I can sometimes feel a bit dizzy but, the main thing is really the, lack of hearing, and the numbness that's got me like, yeah, no idea what's going on there. OK, fine. Alright. Um, So, , what I think , go on. I mean, there was just like, there was one thing I think just, 'cause I can panic and you can look online, get a bit, frantic. , I guess what I'm trying to think is, you know, is there something particularly serious that, you know, will need to be sorted and. Obviously, really, anything can just make you really frantic . Hopefully nothing , so serious I will die from it, I don't know I just, I think got myself in a pickle. OK. so um, uh, obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via the video, uh, portal. Mmm. um, from what you've told me, this doesn't seem to be you know, anything um, that you're gonna die from. However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today. OK. OK? I ,would like you to come to one of my clinics. I would like a GP to assess you. what you're, what you're describing might be something called Bell's Palsy. OK? Um, OK. Yeah. We can go into that, explaining what that is, if um, if that's confirmed on, on physical examination. But um, that's not usually a life-threatening problem. OK. But, um, part of the reason why I'd like you to come in, it's just that we can do a, a what we call a, a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on, and confirm that might be the diagnosis. Have a look, have a look inside the ear, see if there's any, , anything to see within the ear. OK. So, um, um, so, in answer to your question. No, I don't think that you need to worry about that, I , think you know , preliminarily I can, I can reassure you. OK. However, , in order to definitively reassure you, I, I think you need a physical examination today, OK. , so what I wanna do, is I'm gonna send a message to our admin team, I'll ask them, to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's fine. OK. Um, within Central London. OK, and then you can ring the , the support team number, I'll leave that number in your notes. And you can ring them after five minutes, and then they'll slot you in to a place that's convenient for you, OK. OK. Yeah. , that's fine. All right.

OK, alright. Um , I know it's a long time ago, but do you remember how it all started? what were you doing at the time when it all started? Is it anything you may have done, to bring your symptoms on? Uh, I mean I am a, I do work as a housekeeper. Um And to be honest, I'm not always very good about wearing gloves.

Is that, you mentioned in your legs as well? Yeah. Yeah but isn't, sorry. Is that, is that something you've, you've had for a while now? Yeah. It's not really, it's not really major. Uh yeah it's just like literally grinding my legs. OK. Right, OK. trouble. OK. I'm just going to ask you some very brief yes or no questions, if that's OK. With your symptoms, have you, have you had any other symptoms, such as fever, or temperatures? No. Any nausea, or any vomiting? No. Any problem with your bowels? No. Any problem with your urine, or waterworks? No. Otherwise you feel well, do you? And yourself, your eating, drinking, your appetite is well-maintained? Yeah. OK, alright. Fine. Um, in terms of your past medical history, do you have any other conditions at all? I have diabetes. Do you know if that's type one or type two? Type two. Diabetes, OK. Anything else? Um no.

In terms of social history, you mentioned that you work as a housekeeper. Um are you, you're not always very good at wearing gloves. Yeah. Um, you've recently changed jobs. Which which kind of places do you work in? Is it mainly residential, or is it commercial? Yeah. At a hotel. I have to do the whole thing like bedrooms, bathrooms, . Hotel, OK. OK. OK. Do you think there might be a relationship between the two? Between the, kind of the products you're using, and your symptoms? Yeah, I usually use those for bathrooms. But, yeah bedrooms and corridors not always. OK. Have your symptoms stopped you from doing any work? Have you had to take time off work recently? Uh, yeah like the past three days, I haven't been able to go to work. OK. Can I ask a couple questions? Do you smoke at all? No. Do you drink much in the way of alcohol? pints a week. Once a week?

I tried uh E forty five. Any luck with that? Yeah, no it didn't really do anything. No, OK. Alright. Um I also tried an antihistamine, antihistamine. Uh but it didn't . OK, alright. Um, Mrs. Parkinson, so I think um, based on your story, I I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis. Which is very common in, particularly people in your in your in your field, who are using cleaning products, not using gloves. And sometimes you get a bit of reaction between the chemicals and your skin. Um, so moving forward there's a couple of options. So firstly, what we try and do is, you know, avoid the triggers. In your case, I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times. Yeah. OK. And in terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin, um we can try some steroid creams to help with the inflammation. Yeah. As well as some stronger emollients, um which you really need to kind of coat on, three four times a day, for the next couple of weeks, just to help with the moisturizing of your skin. Um if it still hasn't got better in about a week, two weeks time, I really need you to come back and see me again. And we can maybe think about other things we can give to you. OK. Is that all clear? Uh yeah, that sounds good. Great. Do you have any questions for me? Um, where do I get the medicine from? I'll I'll I'll do a prescription for you now, and send it over to your pharmacy. OK great. Yeah, uh so you said a couple of weeks, it should get better, right? OK. I think I think minimum couple of weeks. Uh ten days to fourteen days.

Let's start again. So how can I help you sir? Yes. So, it's been a few days now. I have like a sore, and a red skin. It's kind of, it's really itchy, and it's like super annoying. So I'd like to find something quick to solve it. OK. No, no problem. I'm happy to help. Um whereabouts in your skin is it affected? Uh, mostly like my chest, my, my hands, my arms. Like, like really, it's it's super annoying. Like it's itching a lot, like all the time. And I can't even sleep at night. I really need something quickly to, to solve it. Because even at work I, I can, when I'm in a meeting and I have to, like uh think about my work, I can't focus, I can't actually focus on my work. It's really annoying because I can't actually think about, uh, what I have to say. I'm always like, uh, disturbed by this disease. Yeah. No no, OK. I'm certain this is obviously affecting you. And uh we'll try our very best to get get this sorted out for you. Um, have you had anything like this before in the past? Um so yes. Uh earlier I was like prescribed for my eczema. OK. And they gave me like some cream, and something to, uh when I like shower, when I was in the shower, had to put something. But um OK. Did it help? Um I mean, at that time yes. That's, those symptoms, like these symptoms appear like, when the symptoms appeared again, I tried those and it didn't work. I've tried a few things. Like I bought a, a steroid cream at the pharmacy last night. But it apparently didn't help, because it's still itching a lot today. Uh, yeah. OK. OK. Do you remember the name of the cream you bought? A steroid cream. OK, steroid, OK. um would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms, or different? Um it's much more like itchy. And my eczema was more like only in the arm. But now it's also on the chest. And in the on the, on the hands as well. OK. Like pretty, yeah when, like I like, for instance hiking, during the weekend. And I am, I can't really do it anymore, because it's like very like I wanted to do that last weekend. And because super painful, and I I have to take like showers every day to be able to, cannot uh ease this itching part, which is very very annoying. Yes. No. Well OK. That's so you mentioned the itchiness. Um you also mentioned it's been quite sore. Yeah. Um have you, have you noticed any uh bleeding or discharge from your skins? . OK. No. Um so my skin is a bit cracked in some parts, like kind of cracked, if you see what I mean. But uh, yeah. OK. You've not, haven't uh seen any other uh pus or blood, coming out of your skin. No. No. And you mentioned it all started three days ago. Are you, four days ago. Are you aware of any triggers, or anything that you may have done, that may have caused your symptoms to start? Four days ago. So for example, have you changed your uh shower gel, any clothing? Have you been around anyone else? No I . It's actually like, it's really annoying, because I'm thinking about, maybe I should change something. Because I I haven't, and I don't understand I cannot, um afraid of asking people around me because it's cannot you know um, I don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions. It's kind of intimate that. So I your help now. Mm. Mm. No no, OK. That's OK. Um Fine, so just to resummarize. For the last four days, you've had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, mainly your chest. And did you also mention your arms and legs as well? Yeah. Uh, no. Just the chest, hands and like, like inside the elbows. Yeah. OK. anything on your face at all? Am I what? On your face? On my face? No. No, OK. And apart from this, any other symptoms have you noticed? For example, have you noticed any temperature or fevers? No. just very itchy. Nothing else. Itchy. OK. So your, your bowels are working OK? Your chest is OK? No cough, no breathing difficulties? No. You're passing urine OK. I I think so. OK, alright. Um It's always good to know. So, I mean, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Any what? Any ideas, as to what could be causing your symptoms? Um so I had eczema before. So maybe it's disease, but it seems like more uh, like uh my eczema was only on the arms. So, I'm I'm not sure. I I really have no idea. OK. That's OK. So um, normally at this stage I like to examine you. Um To see the rash itself, to see exactly what type of rash it is. But from what you've told me, you mentioned it's, you've got some dry skin and some, uh cracked skin as well. Uh and has been very itchy. And so would your um Yeah. Uh your your background of eczema. Um So Sorry to say, there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you, which I completely forgot, my apologies. Um, apart from the eczema, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? Uh, no. I just had asthma in the past. But not anymore. OK. Not anymore, OK. And do you take any regular medications at the moment? Uh no. No, OK. Do you have any allergies to anything? I like some , sorry? Yeah? sorry I said do you have any allergies to anything? Hello? Hello? Yes. can you hear me? That's alright I think it . Uh do you have any allergies at all? Ohh, allergies. Uh, no. No, OK. Um and tell me about your um uh your situation at home. Who do you live with? Uh so, I live with a few flatmates. I'm a, so you know I'm thirty one. Uh I, yeah I'm I have a full time job. And so I'm living with a few people to save money. OK. And what do you do for work? Uh I work uh at a pharmaceutical company. So it's been a, it's been a few years now. Uh it's uh, it's kind of interesting. We're working I'm a, like a kind of project manager. Uh I mean, do you want to, to know more about it? OK. Uh no no no that's , that's absolutely fine. Um just a couple of questions I want to ask you, which can sometimes affect your symptoms, is, do you smoke at all? No. No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Uh you know, once in a while I can, I like hanging out with people once in a while. So yeah I'd say a few, a few beers per week. Something like this. Nothing, nothing crazy. I used to drink a lot more when I was younger. But it's been, it's been a while. OK. OK. OK I've got to say, at this stage I've got to say this sound quality is not uh great. But I will continue because we've come this far. Um So um, based on everything you mentioned Sarah , I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema. Um The reason being that you said it was quite itchy. Um it's mainly affecting your chest and your back. Um and uh, having looked at your skin, uh the the the rash does appear quite familiar. Um you mentioned using steroid creams, yesterday. Um from the pharmacy. I wonder whether giving you a stronger prescription of a of a steroid may be beneficial. Uh, which I'm happy to prescribe to you today. As well as, I'm going to give you something, some emollients, which helps to moisturize the skin. OK. OK. Um which use in the bath and shower. And it's definitely worth um using that for the first seven to ten days. OK. Uh before we make the decision on whether it's working or not. OK. Um it's also worth um using antihistamines, which you can sometimes buy over counter. Things like Loratadine or Piriton, which can help the itchiness of your skin. OK. And uh, um it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use, in terms of shower gels or soap. Because if that's causing your symptoms, then we need to have a discussion about an eczema CU. OK. Yes, I have tried antihistamines, uh lately, but it didn't really help. Ohh, could you say that again, sorry? I have tried uh antihistamines, but uh but it didn't really help. OK. OK. So it's something for you to think about. you can get different types of antihistamines. I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well. Um, something like Fexofenadine, which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying, and it's not going to do you any harm. OK. Um but I think using the steroids and the emollients, um on a regular basis Uh over the next week to ten days, should hopefully control your symptoms. But do come back and see me next week, if things don't get better. That sounds good. OK? Um do you have any questions for me? Uh, no that's it. Thank you very much. Bye. Thank you as well. Bye. OK. Well I wish you all the best. Thank you. Have a good day.",

But from what you've told me, you mentioned you've got some dry skin and some cracked skin as well. And it's been very itchy.

Apart from the eczema, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? No, I just had asthma in the past, but not anymore. Okay. And do you take any regular medications at the moment? No. No, okay. Do you have any allergies to anything? Sorry, yeah. Sorry, I was gonna have any allergies to anything? Hello? Hello? Yes. Oh, can you hear me? Oh, sorry, I think it cracked.

So you know I'm thirty one, I have a full time job, and so I'm living with a few people to save money. Okay, and what do you do for work? I work at a pharmaceutical company, so it's been a few years now. It's kind of interesting. We're working. I'm a kind of project manager. Do you want to know more about it? Okay.

You know, once in a while I like hanging out with people once in a while. So yeah, I'd say a few beers per week, something like this. Nothing crazy. I used to drink a lot more when I was younger, but it's been OK. I've got to say at this stage, I've got to say the sound quality is not great. But I will continue because we've come this far.

What can I do for you today? Um, I've been having this, blinding headache for a few days. Um, and it's like, really bothering me and , I find it very hard to focus or, like I can't even go to work. OK, and any headaches in the past before this? Not really just they're, on and off. Um, I recently had a, a one for like two days, um, but it just went away with Ibuprofen, so nothing like, more, longer than two days before. So, how did this start? Um, it just started all of a sudden. I woke up one morning with a headache, and that was three days ago, and I just keep having it. Doesn't really go away with Ibuprofen either, I try that, but it just. It gets a little bit better but like, doesn't go away. OK, and whereabouts in your head is the pain? Um, it's kind of all over but, I feel like over my right eye, it's um bit, stronger. OK. Any problems with your vision? Or, any problems tolerating the light? Um, lights definitely make me more sensitive. Like, um, I don't really, like strong lights. Um, and um, yeah, vision I think, I get this, shooting light sometimes. Um, not sure how to explain it. Just a bit of um, weird kind of vision. OK, and um, any, any nausea or vomiting? Uh, no, feeling a bit sick, but no vomiting. Any tingling? Or numbness? Or weakness anywhere? Um, no. Any change in your smell or taste? No, none at all. Um, and, in the past, when you've had headaches, what have they been like? Um, I was sick but I had no more headache, it's just um, a bit of a pressure, in between my eyes, um. But nothing major. OK, and, with, with this, has it been there all the time? Or is it coming and going? Kinda all the time. Um, so when I take Ibuprofen it gets a bit better, so it's a bit, like less um, it, it bothered me less, but then I still have it, it's still there. Um, and what would you say, the severity is? If, if ten is the worst pain you've ever had, and zero is nothing, what would you say the pain is like? I guess it's mostly, eight, and then it kinda comes down to maybe a five. OK, and what about at night-time, are you able to fall asleep? Um, yeah, I'm, sleeping well. Is it waking you up in the night-time? No, no, no. But I can wake up with it in the morning. OK. Any worse when you change position, or bend over, or cough, or anything like that? Mmm. Sometimes when I stand up, quickly I get a bit of a, stabbing pain. Um, or if I throw my head like, it I kind of feel like something is moving inside. OK. And have you had any, uh, eye checks recently? Um, yeah, actually had one recently and, nothing changed my vision. OK. And have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears, or pain over the sinuses? Any cough or flem? No, no. No. Any, any nose bleeds, or coughing up any blood or anything? No. And just recently, have you been well, or have you had any general problems? Any change in your weight? Or, tiredness, lack of energy, anything like that? Um, no change of weight, maybe um, lack of energy but it might be because, I'm just having these headaches. so I'm find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities , you know when you have this constant headache. Have you been at work recently? Um, I work from home but, couldn't really manage to, do it all the time. So sometimes I just took a day off. So, you've been, you've had a headache for three days. , how many days have you missed off work? Um, so I worked from home all these three days and, um. First day I worked from home and then, um, the second I just took the whole day off. And, today I just tried to work from home the first half of the day but, I, I just stopped in the morning 'cause, I couldn't focus. OK. And, any other, medical problems in the past? Um, I think I only had a, a pain, um, when I was younger but, no causes found and that went away, but that's, the only thing I know of. OK. Have you been abroad recently at all? No. Do you take any medications? Um, just the pill. Which one? Um, . And when did you start that? Um, about a year ago. Any side effects with that? Uh, no I don't think so. Have you noticed any, any um, increased frequency of headaches since you started that? Um, no, , these headaches just very recently, but nothing um, but nothing really changes. OK. And when you'd , when you've had, when you described your headaches in the past, you said they were just general. Did you have any visual symptoms? Flashing lights? Nausea, vomiting with them? No. No, no. No nothing, none of those. Have you had your blood pressure checked recently with your pill? Um, yeah, I had it checked in the pharmacy when I got the pill, and they say it was normal. And when was that? Uh, a year ago. OK. Um, and any allergies to anything? No. And who do you live with at home? Sorry? Who do you live with at home? Uh, just by myself. OK. And do you smoke? Uh, no. Do you drink any alcohol regularly? Yeah. How much in a normal week do you think? Um, probably like, three , once a week. . OK. And do you take any other drugs at all? Um, no apart from the Ibuprofen that I take, sometimes when, the headache gets really bad, nothing else. OK. Um. So, uh, I mean it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache. And you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well? Yeah. But you haven't had a high temperature. Have you checked your temperature? Uh, no I didn't, I don't really feel, feverish or anything. OK. Um, I mean it, it, it could possibly be a migraine type headache. But, the fact it's still ongoing for three days, we probably should, book you into an appointment to get an examination. Um, obviously , if it settles, in the meantime then, we can cancel that. But we should do a neurological examination, look at the back of your eyes as well. OK. Um, in terms of medication, I can prescribe you something, similar to Ibuprofen, but a bit stronger which you can take instead of Ibuprofen. And you can also take Paracetamol at the same time. OK. So if you're happy to book a, , appointment with us, with the support line, for us to do a full examination. And start, the medication which I prescribe to you, take it with food. If, if you're, you said that when you go to bed your headache's, OK, and not waking you up in the night-time. Yeah it's not, um but, you mentioned migraine and that um, reminded that, my mum, suffers from, like she has migraines, um. OK. Any other family history of medical problems? Um, no I think that's it, but I know that my mum like, she has quite bad migraines, she's like, has the vomiting and everything, . OK that's fine. Um, I mean if, if in the meantime before your appointment your, headache is getting unbearable, getting worse or changing. Then , um, if it's that bad, then you should go to A and E and have an examination. Um, , you can call us for further advice on that. OK. Mm-hmm, OK. And when, when you have a, an examination with us, we'll check your blood pressure as well. Just to, make sure your pill's still appropriate for you, because sometimes if we, if we do think it's a migraine, then you would have to change your pill. If you've had these flashing lights, and things like that. OK, . Is there anything in the pill that can cause it? Or is it? Well , some , so that pill if you were having , regular migraines with um, flashing lights, or , other symptoms. It wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill, particularly, we'd have to change it to something else. All right. But you can carry on with that for the moment. OK. Have you got any other questions? Um, so will you like, um, send me a referral to a specialist, or do I have to to confirm? Uh. Yeah, if you book an appointment with the support team, then we can do a full examination then. OK. Perfect. All right then. Take care. Thank you very much. Bye.",

And by the end of the day it was like pretty, pretty, like it was a lot, basically. And then I was thinking OK, maybe I'll just go to sleep. And when I woke up the next morning like, it was even, even worse basically. So Mm-hmm. So, you think the headache is getting worse over the last three days? Yeah. OK. Have you tried anything which has made the headache better? Um so I tried uh Ibuprofen. Um so I took, like a few. Um for the last two days, basically. Did that help? But it doesn't really help, no. In in the past it did help me, which is why I decided to try it. But OK, all right. And except for the headaches, any other symptoms at all? Um So, example any, problems your eyesight or your vision? Not really, but just when it started, I I got this like weird shooting lights. And like now like light is quite annoying, my eyes. So when you say annoying, does it hurt to look, uh, look at bright lights? Yeah, yeah. It hurts. So , OK. And um, have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision? Not loss of vision, I wouldn't say. It's just like some lights from, shooting lights . Mmm, , OK. Any nausea or any vomiting? Um, well I'm like basically, I I'm sick with the headache. But I, no vomiting. When you say sick, you mean you feel sick? OK. Yeah, no vomiting, OK. Any neck pain or neck stiffness? Yeah. No. OK. And any difficulty with speaking or, um, speech? No. Any difficulty , with weakness in your arms and legs? No, it's hard to focus though. So, I I had to take a couple of days off work, actually. Ohh really? OK. OK, yeah probably, well I'll, I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on. Um, any recent head injuries at all? Uh, no. OK. And have you had anything like this before in the past? Yeah I mean, headaches, you mean. Or, uh, or similar, similar to, similar to this kind of headache, ? Yeah. I mean I had. But, usually after I I take uh Ibuprofen it kind of goes away. So, but this time it's just not. . not, OK. All right. Um, any temperatures, or fevers? No. Any rashes at all, on your skin? Mm, no not that I've noticed. OK. And just moving forwards. Are you otherwise fit and well, Adriana? Am I what, sorry? You fit and well? , do you have any other medical history? Yeah, I think so. It's just the headache. Any history of migraines at all? Not myself, I've never had a migraine. But my sister and my mom have them quite frequently. OK. Um, fine. I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask, do you take any regular medication? Uh, no no. Are you on the pill? OK. Do you have any allergies to any medications? Mm not that I know of. OK. So you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines. Yeah. Are they, is that normally well-controlled or are they um, having difficulty, controlling their symptoms? Um so my sister's, like better. Like it's kind of, it's very rare. But my mom's is like quite bad, um usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that. It's, yeah. Mm-hmm, OK. Takes her out for a few days, basically. Ohh right, OK, fine. Um, socially, tell me a bit more about your life, outside of, um, outside of, work. So , who lives at home with you? Uh I live with housemates. So, three of them. So we're four . OK. Excellent. And are you working at the moment? You mentioned this , impacting on your work. Yeah so I work, well I work in IT. So I work with computers a lot. So it kind of is difficult to focus. Um I had to like reduce the uh, brightness of my screen. Mmm. OK. Do you wear glasses? Yes, I do. Have you had any, uh, have you had any recent eye check, done? Eye test? No, uh I've been wearing them since I was five , five year old. So, it's quite a long time. OK, all right. Something for you to bear in mind if you feel that you are, your eyes are straining. Um I would always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Um, have you been feeling more stressed or anxious at work recently? Well, it's been a bit stressful, kicking off a new project. But um, yeah nothing out of the ordinary, really. OK, all right. Great. Um, regarding smoking or alcohol. Do you drink or smoke at all? I socially smoke. And I drink only socially. But only socially? OK. Right. Now um, Adriana, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Have you, have you read anything online, or spoken to people? Um Not really. Um at first I thought it's stress, or maybe I didn't drink enough water. Because sometimes when I don't drink enough water, I I like get headaches. Um Mm-hmm. But, I don't think that's it. And I'm like worried, it's, I don't want it to be a migraine. Because I know what it's like, from my mom and my sister. Mmm. And it's really annoying. So I I really don't want to have that. And I know it's genetic. So I've researched that. Um but I don't know if that is the case. So, yeah. OK. Is it anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today? Yeah maybe just kinda, if you have any recommendations of that I can take something stronger. Because apparently, Ibuprofen doesn't help me. Uh OK. Usually it gets resolved if I have headache in like, after like one or two days. But currently it, it didn't help me. How many tablets did you take of Ibuprofen? Uh, three a day. Three a day, OK. All right. Um, so uh, Adriana, so um, really what I think is going on here. I , uh, unfortunately I do think this could be, a headache very similar to a migraine. Um, the reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it, given your mum and your sister also migraines. I think it's something for us to think about. Um, now I'm not saying it's gonna, keep happening, but, it may just be a one-off. But it's certainly worth treating it today stronger analgesia or painkillers. Um, now moving forward, we have some options which we can discuss. Uh, you tried the Ibuprofen. Now, my only worry is, I'm not sure whether you're taking, the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets, three times a day. Ohh right. So, so , there's definitely room for, improvement there. Or, I can prescribe you something stronger, like Naproxen, which is another anti-inflammatory, which can be helpful. Mm-hmm. Um, we can also add in other, painkillers like, Paracetamol, or Codeine. Which might be helpful as well. Mm, yeah. I think is what my mom takes for when she has um, um migraines. OK. And I think it's , certainly worth looking into that, so I can give you a , prescription for that today. Um, with regards to um, the next few days. It may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's, you know, if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse. Mm-hmm. And, and, you know I'd like you to come back and see me, in about uh, a week's time, week to two weeks' time. If you are having , more frequent episodes of these type of headaches. We can think about giving you medications as, prophylactic. Which basically means, medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis. But we can have that discussion next time. Mm, OK. OK. In the meantime if your headaches aren't getting any better, or they're getting worse. Um, you know, I want you to give me a call, or come back and see me sooner. OK? OK. Yeah. So, if you're having any problems with your vision, or weakness in your arms and legs, or you're just not feeling very well. Just give me a call, and come back and see me. OK. All right? Great. Great. Well, have a good day. Thank you. You too. Bye! Bye.",

No. And is there anything you think might have triggered this off? Have you been abroad anywhere? No, but then, um, my, um my brother, um, has actually been having similar symptoms, um, for the past, um, few days as well, and he does say like everyone in school's got this so, I, I don't know, that might, that might be something. So you've been in contact with him, have you? Yes. OK. Um, and any other medical problems? Have you had any other symptoms at the moment, like rash? No, no rash, no, nothing that, um. No. OK. Um, any surgery before, or abdominal problems, or any other medical issues? Well, apart from the fact that this one is giving me abdominal pains, no previous abdominal pains before. Obviously I get the odd, um, you know, menstrual cramps and all that but, you know, that's, you know, that comes and goes. Yeah. OK. And whereabouts is the pain that you're getting? Um, it's kind of like towards my navel area, like I can't touch my navel area. It's just so sore. And it gets, yeah, it's almost like the center of my navel. Um, and does the pain come and go? Yes, it does come. When it comes, I feel this strong urge to go to the, to the loo, and then and sort of like comes again, it comes and. OK. Um, and do you take any medication regularly? Well, I, I take my, my vitamins, vitamin D, every day. That's about, that's about all that I regularly take. OK. And have you got a normal diet? Yeah, I eat well, normally. Right. Do you smoke or drink alcohol? Well, I don't smoke, but, you know, I have a pint from time to time. And do you take any other drugs? No. Like I said, I only take, um, vitamins. And for my menstrual cramps, when they come, maybe I might take a, a, an ibuprofen just to ease the pain, but. And when was, when was your last period? Um, two weeks ago. OK. Are you on any contraception? No. Are you having regular sexual intercourse? No. OK. Um, and what's your job? Um, um, uh. Um, uh. A graphics designer. Have you had to miss work because of this problem? Well, yes, I've had to actually work from home today. I'm working from home today because I can't, I can't be out for work. OK. And who do you live with at home? I live with my brother and my mum. OK. OK. And, um, have you tried anything yourself for this problem? Well, I've tried a home remedy. Um, I've tried the, the, uh, ORS, you know, thing I bought from my, my local, my local, uh. Um. What? Could you just repeat that? The ORS, the, the salt sugar ORS, um, um, mix, the salt sugar mix. OK. And how often have you been taking that? Yeah. I've taken that, I've taken that, like, um, three times a day for the past two days. OK. Um, and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off, or getting worse, or ? I, I, I they're not getting any better, 'cause like I said, I've been, I've been vomiting literally everything I take, so, so I doubt that even that had, had the chance to work. Yeah. OK. Um. I mean, it sounds like, because your brother's had a similar thing, it sounds like it might be some, an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got, which is usually caused by a virus. But, it can be from something you've eaten, as well. Um. If the symptoms, they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts. Um, if the symptoms are continuing to get worse, the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough. Um, sometimes you do require certain medication to help this, if it's, sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria. Um, what I would say, probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not starting to ease off. I think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool, so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment. OK. Um, and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated, because if you're, if you're not keeping fluid down, then you can get dehydrated. Um, so. So, how, how do I, how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even, like, drink water? I'm throwing up everything. Yeah. So you need to carry on with your rehydration salts, and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago. So, you're obviously still, um, hydrated enough to pass urine. OK. But we, um, we should see you so that we can check your hydration and, um, get that sample sent off as soon as possible. 'cause if, if, if you come into the clinic, you can send that sample off straightaway. Otherwise, we would have to post it out to you which would take time. OK. Ohh, OK. So, when can I come to the clinic to have this done? Um, so we can, we can make you an urgent appointment, um, and then you can, you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration. Um, but if, in the meantime, you're feeling more unwell, then we would get you seen urgently in A and E. OK. So you can call us back in the meantime. OK. So, what I'll do is, yeah. If you could, please book me the appointment and, um, yeah, I'll see how I feel, um, for the end of the day. Hopefully I don't need to go to the A and E, and, um . Yeah. If you keep drinking, keep going with the rehydration salts. Just tiny sips constantly, to so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and, and you vomit, so just tiny, tiny sips but just keep going with it. Um, and just have very simple food, if you're gonna have anything, like toast or biscuit or something really light like that. Avoid, um, fruit, vegetables, uh, milk, anything like that, which might just make it worse. Mm-hmm. OK. OK. So you'll have to book an appointment through the support line. OK. Yes, please. Right, OK. We'll do that for you. OK, take care. Thank you. Thanks, bye.",

So how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even drink water? I'm throwing up everything. Yeah, so you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago. So you're obviously still hydrated enough to pass urine. But we should see you so that we can check your hydration and get that sample sent off as soon as possible. Because if you come into the clinic you can send that sample off straight away. Otherwise we would have to post it out to you, which would take time. Okay, so when can I come to the clinic to have this done? So we can make you an urgent appointment and then you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration. But if in the meantime you're feeling more unwell then we would get you seen urgently in A and E. Okay. So you could call us back in the meantime. Okay. So what I'll do, yeah, if you could please book me the appointment and then yeah, I'll see how I feel before the end of the day. Hopefully I don't need to go to A and E. Yeah. You can keep drinking, keep going with the rehydration salts. Just tiny sips constantly to so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and you vomit. So just tiny tiny sips but just keep going with it. And just have very simple food if you're going to have anything like toast or biscuit or something really light like that. Avoid fruit, vegetables, milk, anything like that which might just make it worse. Okay. Okay. So you'll have to book an appointment through the support line? Yes, please. Right, okay, we'll do that for you. Okay, take care. Thank you. Thanks, bye."

I think I thought it was my period, it's like a little bit, pink. In your pee, did you say? Your, so your pee is slightly red? Or slightly pink? But I am kind of like due, on my, didn't know if that was like, yeah, a part of it. OK. So, when was your last menstrual period? Um, around a month ago, yeah, three and a, three and a bit weeks ago.

Not a sudden onset? OK, and uh, your last menstrual period was just three and a bit weeks ago. Um, and you, but you say you've had some . A little bit of spotting, possibly before um, in-between periods, or recently. Yeah, and the last kind of week or so, yeah, the last couple of days really. But, because I was due on. Yeah, I, I think. Yeah, just the last couple of days. OK, and, but you're expecting your period soon? Yes, yeah. Sure. Um. OK, and just to ask a few questions. Are you, uh, do you have any other medical, uh, problems? Um, that I need to be aware of? Uh. Don't . I'm um, allergic to Amoxicillin. Allergic to Amoxicillin.

Not any that. Spring to mind in my immediate family. Um, my brother is a type one diabetic. Sure. great so, um, is there anything that you're particularly concerned about with, um, this nausea, and uh, the constipation? Um, I don't know it just a really, like really horrible ache. Um. And I'm nauseous, hot, sweaty, feeling, I'm not really sure. Mmm. I, yeah, why it's happening, um. the last couple of days, that's probably all that's. yeah. Any. Yeah, it's getting uncomfortable. Yeah. Anything that you'd hoped, particularly, to get out of having this consultation? Anything , sorry? was there anything that you'd hoped to, get out of having this specific consultation?

No discharge. OK. All right. So, um, I , I, I think, uh. This could be a few different things. It could just be simple constipation. Uh, you mentioned that you were bunged up, but you did go yesterday. So it's, um, and your, your bowel habits, that you've been going regularly. Uh, but you did mention that you were bunged up. Um, but there could be a few other things going on. I would quite like to, uh, see you to do some further, to do an examination, and to do some, some tests as well. Um, we need to definitely rule out pregnancy, with you. And possibly, um, do some other examinations or, or further tests. So, would you be happy to actually see a GP face-to-face, um, soon? Today, ideally. Yes, yeah. Yeah? Sure, I can make time. Are you, and you're feeling hot, hot and, sweaty. Have you been feeling, um, light-headed at all? Or like you're going to faint? No, no, not like I'm gonna faint. OK. Right well, we're just sort of, timing out, running out of time a little bit. But, um, I'd really like to see you, uh, for some more, uh, examination, investigations. If in the meantime um, between now and, and me, sort or a GP seeing you, you feel worse in any way, you get light-headed. Um, you, uh, uh you have, you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you. Um, then I think you should take them quite seriously, and, and see somebody more urgently if possible. Um, OK. Is that, uh, , was there anything else that you wanna talk about right now? I'm glad we got the ball rolling with this, and uh, we can , um, sort of see you again, to take this a little bit further. Mm-hmm. OK. Yeah, thank you, really appreciate that. OK. All right. Thanks for your time. OK. cheers, bye. Thanks, bye.",

      "reference_text": "Hello? Hello. Hello there. It's uh Doctor here. How can I help you this afternoon? Ohh, I just got a terrible headache since mid-day. Um on the left side. It's just making me feel so ill. I just feel like I need to vomit. I'm sorry to hear that. Um can you tell me a bit more about the headache? Well you know, I noticed some zig-zag lines in my vision a few minutes before the headache started. Mm-hmm. My vision blurred. Um, you know, it just I, yeah. Pain's just horrible. Just making me feel so unwell. Um Mm, OK. And just want you to do something. Well, let's try our best. Let's try and get you, let's try and get you well, soon. Um you mentioned it's on your left hand side. Is that right? And it started at mid-day, a few hours ago. Yeah. OK. Um did the pain come on quite suddenly? Or was it more of a gradual build up? Don't know, really. It just happened. OK. And are you able to describe what kind of headache it was? For example, was it throbbing, or was it more of a sharp pain? Yeah, I guess it's, yeah I guess it's throbbing, um on that left side. And is it moving anywhere else, at all? No, but it's worse when I move. Uh OK. Is that when you move your neck? Well, like if I lean forward, or like move my head or neck, yeah, headache gets worse. OK. Um I'm just really worried. Like I've just been googling and like I've read, you know if your headache gets worse if you move, it could be a sign of brain cancer. OK. Is that all you're worried about? cancer. Is that, is that all your main worries today? Ohh yeah, yeah and I'd like, you know My, my friend's mum, she she recently died of a brain tumor. So, it's really concerning me actually. Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that. I can, I can understand why it's affecting you. Um But why don't we, why don't we take a good history first, and let me examine you. And then we can have a little chat afterwards, and see what's going on here. Um so you mentioned a few things. You mentioned a headache. You also mentioned some disease, like Lyme's, uh before the headaches came on. And your vision has been blurry as well. Is that right? Is that , is that on both eyes, or just in left, left eye? Yeah. Eh, feels like it some days. Both eyes, OK. Have you any difficulty with seeing bright lights, at all? Yeah well I'm , wearing sunglasses right now. It's just, you know, the light's really hurting my eyes. Ohh, I see OK. Um and you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous. Have you vomited at all? Yeah. I vomited twice. Twice, OK. Um earlier today, OK. Um, any temperatures or fevers? Um, no I don't feel feverish. OK. Um, any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed? No, I haven't noticed anything like that. OK. Um fine. Um, and do you normally get headaches? Um, I'm not really prone to them, no. No but I did, I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago. OK. And what happened then? Just similar. How long did it last for? Couple of days. Did you do anything that made it better? Um yeah I had to take painkillers, and had to go go to bed and rest and Yeah. couple days off work, and I work in the fashion industry. And you know, they're wondering what's going on, like I have to take sick days. Yeah. Yeah. I need to get back to work today. But you know, what if it is a brain tumour? What's gonna happen with my future and my career? Yeah. Yeah. You know, really about this. never had headaches like this before. Like why should I get them now? Yeah, sure. I mean I can see your concern obviously is a lot, there's a lot of worry there. Um but you know let let let, as I said let's take it step by step, um to see exactly what the cause of these headaches are first. Um, I'm just going to ask you some, um very uh yes no questions if that's OK, ma'am. Um Um have you noticed any problems with your speech at all, any difficulties with your words? No. Any problems with your arms and legs? For example numbness or weakness? No. Any difficulty with balance, your balance or coordination? No. OK. And have you had any injuries to your head? Have you had a fall recently, or been knocked on the head? No. OK, alright. Um and and you're feeling otherwise OK. So, for example your um Uh your your breathing's OK? You're not feeling breathless, or No, OK. Um do you have any other medical history I should be aware of? No, nothing. No. So for example, have you had, has anyone told you you've had migraines in the past? No. No, OK. Do you No. My mum, my mum has, has migraines. But I've, I've not been diagnosed. OK. Right, my next question was that of family history. Is there anything in the family? So apart from migraines, is there anything else? Is there anything related to brain, for example? as well. What was that, sorry? My mom has an underactive thyroid as well. thyroid as well. OK. Um OK any other problems with for example, the brain, or? Um you mentioned brain cancer. Any other family history of ? No. No, OK. Um in terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis? Um I take the pill, Microgynon. OK. And how long have you been on that for? three months. Three months, OK. And is that mainly for contraception, or is that for something else? it's for contraception. OK, alright. That's something you meant to have a little discussion about today as well. Um Uh well my next question was about um your social, your situation at home. You mentioned you work in the fashion industry. And your work, is your job quite stressful at the moment? Yeah it's really stressful, actually. Have you been having problems at like work, you know managers like putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver and, uh yeah it's not a good time. . Is it getting you down? I don't feel down, just a little bit stressed. OK, alright. And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress, normally? Nothing really. OK. Do you do much in the way of exercise? No. No, OK. Um who's at home with you? Um, I live on my own. OK. Um are you coping OK at the moment? Fine. Yeah? OK. Um do you smoke at all? and do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No. No. OK, alright. Um, so normally at this I'd like to kind of proceed to examination. Um That's um based on your story, um I wonder whether you may, uh may have a migraine, uh migraine type headache. Uh it sounds Um, very classical of that, of that nature, the the the headache on one side, throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, um sensitivity to bright lights. Uh, I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious, such as meningitis, or indeed Brain cancer, I know that was a big worry of yours initially. Um thank you, uh thanks so much. I was so worried that I had cancer. And, ohh now you say migraine. Yeah I guess my mum has similar symptoms to me and yeah, it does make sense. yeah. Yeah. Well, I hope that puts your, you know, mind at ease. Um, certainly this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month. Um, So I think, moving forwards, there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important, uh to see exactly what's triggering these headaches. And in terms of trying to treat your headaches today, some strong painkillers would be advisable. So, think about Paracetamol, or even Co-codamol. Um, and some anti-inflammatories, such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen. How's that sound to you? K that sounds good. Um and uh, you know if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we could maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place, something prophylactic medicines. then we could have a discussion next time I see you next week, perhaps. OK. OK. OK. Um, now a couple of things I want you to think about is, you know if your symptoms aren't getting better next two three days, or indeed they're getting worse. I'd like you to come back and see me, um straight away if possible. So if your headache's getting worse, not responding to medications Or your um neck pain is getting worse, or you develop any weakness in your arms and legs, or your vision, then I want you to come back and see me straight away. OK? OK. Does that sound all OK? Doctor, that's great. Great. Any questions for me? No. Thank you. OK. Have a good day! K thanks. Bye! Right.",

And are you able to describe what kind of headache it was? For example, was it throbbing or was it more of a sharp pain? Yeah, I guess it's throbbing on that left side. And is it moving anywhere else at all? No, but it's worse when I move. Okay. Is that when you move your neck? Well, like if I lean forward or like move my head or neck, yeah, the headache gets worse. Okay, I'm just really worried, like I've just been Googling and like I've read that you know if your headache gets worse when you move it could be a sign of brain cancer. Okay, is that what you're worried about? Sir. Is that what your main worry is today? Oh yeah, yeah, and I've like, you know, my friend's mum, she recently died of a brain tumour, so it's really concerning me actually. Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that, I can understand why it's affecting you. But why don't we take a good history first and let me examine you and then we can have a little chat afterwards and see what's going on here. So you mentioned a few things, you mentioned the headaches and you also mentioned some zigzag lines before the headaches came on and your vision has been blurry as well, is that right? Is that on both eyes or just the left eye? It feels like it's on both. Both eyes, okay. Have you had any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all? Yeah, well I'm wearing sunglasses right now. It's just, you know, lights really hurting my eyes. Oh, I see, okay. And you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous. Have you vomited at all? Yeah. I vomited twice. Twice, okay. This earlier today, okay. Any temperatures or fevers? No, I don't feel feverish. Okay. Any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed? No, I haven't noticed anything like that. Okay, fine. And do you normally get headaches? Not really prone to them, no, no, but I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago. Okay, and what happened then? Just similar. How long did it last for? A couple of days. Did you do anything that made it better? Yeah, I had to take painkillers and had to sort of go to bed and rest and yeah. Couple of days off work and work in the fashion industry and you know, they're wondering what's going on, like having to take sick days. Yeah, I need to get back to work today but you know, what if it is a brain tumour, what's going to happen with my future, my career, you know? Yeah, I'm really excited about this. I've never had headaches like this before. Why should we get now? Yeah, sure. And I can see your concerns. Obviously there's a lot of worry there. But you know, let's take it step by step and see exactly what the causes of these headaches are first. I'm just going to ask you some very yes, no questions. That's okay. Have you noticed any problems with your speech at all? Any difficulty with your words? No. Any problems with your arms and legs, for example numbness or weakness? No. Any difficulty with balance, your balance or coordination? No. Okay. And have you had any injuries to your head? Have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head? No. Okay, all right. And you're feeling otherwise okay, so for example, your breathing is okay, you're not feeling breathless, or no, okay. Do you have any other medical history I should be aware of? No. So for example, have you had, has anyone told you you've had migraines in the past? No. No, okay. My mum has migraines, but I've not been diagnosed. Right, so my next question was about family history. Is there anything in the family, so apart from migraines, is there anything else, anything related to the brain, for example? My mum has an underactive thyroid as well. Okay, any other problems with, for example, the brain or you mentioned brain cancer. Any other family history of that? No. No, okay. In terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis? I take the pill, microgynon. Okay, and how long have you been on that for? Three months. Three months, okay. And is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else? It's for contraception. Okay, all right. That's something we may need to have a little discussion about today as well. My next question was about your social situation at home. You mentioned you work in a fashion industry. Is your work quite stressful at the moment? Yeah it's really stressful actually. Having problems with people at work, you know, managers putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver and yeah it's not a good time. Is it going you down? I don't feel down, just feel a bit stressed. Okay, all right. And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally? Nothing really. Okay, do you do much in the way of exercise? No. Okay. Who's at home with you? I live on my own. Okay. Are you coping okay at the moment? Fine. Yeah, okay. Do you smoke at all? No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No. Okay, all right. So normally at least I'd like to kind of proceed to examination. But based on your story, I wonder whether you may have a migraine type headache. It sounds very classical of that nature, the headache on one side, the throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to bright lights. I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious such as meningitis or indeed brain cancer. I know that was a big worry of yours initially. Thank you. Thanks so much. I was so worried that I had cancer and now you say migraine. Yeah, I guess my mum had similar symptoms to me Yeah, that does make sense. Well, I hope that puts your ear and mine at ease. Certainly, this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month. So I think moving forward, there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important to see exactly what's triggering these headaches. But we should also try and treat your headaches today. Some strong painkillers would be advisable. So you can either think about paracetamol or even coconamol and some anti inflammatory such as ibuprofen and naproxen. How does that sound to you? Okay, that sounds good. And if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we can maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place, something prophylactic medicines. Okay. Then we can have discussion next time I see you next week. Okay. Now, a couple of things I want you to think about is, if your symptoms aren't getting better in the next two, three days or indeed they're getting worse, I'd like you to come back and see me straight away if possible. So if your headache is getting worse and not responding to medications or your neck pain is getting worse or you're developing weakness in your arms and legs or your vision, then I want you to come back and see me straight away. Okay? Okay. Does that sound all okay? Doctor, that's great. Great, any questions for me? No, thank you. Okay, have a good day. Okay, thanks, bye."

Can I, can I check your name and date of birth, please? Uh, hi doctor. My name is. Yes my, my name is uh, Roberto Mendoza. And, uh, I'm, I was born on the first of January, of um, uh, nineteen ninety two. OK. OK, and are you in a space that's quiet and you're able to talk? Ohh sorry, I um, of nineteen ninety, sorry I'm forty eight. Sorry, I forgot that . So, you're forty eight, and are you able to talk at the moment? Yeah, yeah. OK. Tell me, uh, it says here you have a , uh, you're having problems going to the toilet? Yes, so I have uh, I have um. I don't know how do you say it properly, in English. Uh, I mean without sounding good, like diarrhoea, for, for, yeah. So, it's lasting for like three days. And, uh, yeah, I, I don't know, uh, I don't know, what could cause it. I, uh, um. OK. Uh, I have a bit of uh, pain, abdominal pain. And I, had a bit of vomiting. And uh, uh, yeah. So this uh, kind of like uh, what is happening to me. OK. Tell me how you were three days ago, before this started. Did you have any medical problems? Uh, so I have, I have, I have a, asthma, and I take some uh, some uh, um, inhaler. OK. I don't know, uh, I take an inhaler, um. and um. uh, I have an allergy. I have N, N, NK, NKDA allergy. So, I don't know if it's because, uh, I don't know. Could be the inhaler, or, yeah. OK. That's . And apart from asthma, do you have anything else? Uh, I don't maybe it's work, because you know it's, this thing here in the stomach stuff. I, I always have in the back of my head and my father. Because he died about um, ten years ago of bowel cancer. Yep. OK? So, yeah, this is kind of uh. Uh, my, my worries. I, I don't know . OK. So, you've, you've had the diarrhoea for three days, and now you're having pain and vomiting. Yeah. Yes, yes, . Was the diarrhoea been getting better or worse? Uh, uh, I , I think it, it's not getting better or worse. It's kind of like uh, uh, like, middle, like normal, like uh, it, it, it hasn't gone away, it hasn't worsened. OK. OK. And how often do you go to the toilet? I go, I need to go, I, I can't go to work because I need to go like every. I don't is this feeling like I go to the toilet, and then when I finish, I need to, I feel I need to go again. OK. And, and uh, and, yeah. So, I need to be like close to the toilet uh, all the time. That must be, that must be hard. Yeah, yeah, it's. Have you had to drink more water than normal? I don't know, maybe I'm not drinking enough water, yeah. I drink uh, I think I, yeah I don't know. I, I think I don't drink enough water. An important question, have you noticed any blood? Uh, no, I haven't noticed any, any blood. And you mentioned tummy pain, can you tell me more about your tummy pain, like where it is, and if it goes anywhere? So, , the pain is mainly uh, focus in, in the centre area of the abdomen, like under the belly, under the belly button. And, uh, yeah, and sometimes I can hear my stomach, uh, like, it comes, uh, yeah. Yep. OK. You've been able to eat and drink? Uh, yes, but, yes but I, I go to the toilet also often. So I, I, I, yeah I try not to eat a lot because I, yeah I just, going to the toilet every, ten minute. Hmm. And you said the tummy pain's in the middle of your tummy. Does it go anywhere else? No, no, just there, and it, it seems to be alleviate a bit, toilet, and maybe it's like trapped gas. So, I don't know what it is, but. OK. And when was the last time you vomited? I think it was this morning. This morning, I, but the, the thing is like, because I'm not eating anything now. So, I, I haven't vomited again. Did you have any breakfast? Right, I don't know. I didn't. Uh, no sorry, yes I did actually, I did. Pardon, I had some fruit, I had some fruit. OK. And , and you vomited that up, afterwards? And afterwards, I didn't have anything, then I got a bit of nausea, and I vomited, and then, uh, yeah and that was it, and that was it. And I have any today, and so now I'm, uh, I think I'm OK, but uh, yeah, and I don't, yeah. Did you notice any blood when you vomit? Hmm. I think I do, I think I do, but is uh, uh, no, no actually I can't say sorry, I'm sorry. I, I, I don't think there is blood because uh, yeah it was, it was the strawberries that I was having for breakfast. So, so, yeah, it wasn't blood. OK. And, um, did you eat anything that you think might of been bad, or anything that could have caused the tummy pain? Yeah, . Uh, I, I don't know. To be honest, sometimes I have, when I get a bit of anxiety, I, I use my inhaler. And, but my inhaler kind of um, run out the one. Because you know, I'm a foreigner, so I have uh, this brand, but I bought a new one here. Yeah. . OK. And, uh, I don't know maybe this new one has cause it, this, this problem. I don't know. OK. OK. It's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain, like this. Normally, it's when you eat, um, bad food or food that has gone off, and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested. But just to double-check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing? Mmm. Uh-huh. Um, uh, I, I always have problems with my breathing, because of the asthma like, . When I, , I need to use my inhaler a little bit, but apart of the normal, I haven't, I haven't. OK. OK. And how about chest, have you noticed any chest pain? , no, I haven't , I haven't noticed any chest pain. OK. And how about, um, walking and talking, are those all both OK? Uh, walking and talking, uh, yes, yes. Uh, I, I, but uh, but yeah I don't walk very far because uh, I, yeah I need to, I need to go to the toilet now and then. So, I'm spending some time at home. Yep. And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain? Ohh, it does a little bit. OK. Sorry, I was just writing some things down. Sure. So, what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad, and it's causing your tummy pain. And it's , this is normally called gastroenteritis, so, an infection of the tummy. OK. Ohh, OK. Normally, when patients have this do some things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids, because you're losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers, so, if you start getting a temperature then you need . Mmm, OK. Uh-huh. And please stay home for the time being until you get slightly better. OK. OK, I, yeah. And normally, Normally, things like antibiotics don't help, they make the situation worse. OK. I didn't, yeah, sorry I didn't. No, I was saying I didn't have any, fever recently. I, I was sweating a little bit the last four days, but I, I. Not sure if, if I had bit of fever, but very, little or, or, I'm, I'm but I don't think so, I don't think. I don't know maybe. So, that's. Go ahead. So, I think that's what we should do for the time being, if you feel you're getting much worse, than I would suggest you go and see your GP in real, in real life, in person, so they can loot at your belly. OK. OK, I will, yeah I will book then, book , I will wait a couple of days to see, or one more day, and then I will book, and then, yeah. Great! Cool! Do you have any more questions for me? Uh, , no, that's uh, that's it. I was maybe just concerned about my father's uh, medical history, that would uh, I could be at some kind of risk. Yes. So, the, the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had, but if your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look up from the GP. OK. OK, OK. Yeah, that sounds good, that sounds good. OK. Thank you very much doctor, for your time. Bye bye. Does that sound OK? Thank you . Bye bye.",

It feels a bit strange, a bit Sure, OK. , and um, , in terms of your job, do you do anything physical? Not really. No, I just, you know sit at a desk. Um, yeah. Right. OK. , and um, has this happened before? No, no I haven't noticed that before. Um, I don't have any like history of, of seeing this. I don't remember . Sure, OK.

Um, no, well I, I do, well I think, I think I have something like uh, osteoarthritis. Um, Uh, uh, it sometimes kind of hurts, uh, my joints. But uh, in my family, I'm not sure. OK. . No. Sure. , so you know you said you think you've got , uh, osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that, and told you you've got osteoarthritis? Um, yes. Yes, a few years ago. OK. , was that a GP or a specialist or, was it, a physiotherapist? a a GP. Um, yeah. GP, OK, all right. Um, look can I just, uh, sorry can I just double-check how old you are please? I'm uh, fifty three. Fifty three, OK. Fantastic. All right. Um, and, do you have any other illnesses at all? Um, Well not, not really, no. Um, I'm, I'm allergic to, to peanuts. Um, but that's, that's pretty much all I uh, have to say about my medical history, yeah. Right, OK. . OK.

OK, good, good, glad to hear. Well done that's , it's good that you're doing that on a regular basis. OK. Um, and um, uh, can I, is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow, now? Uh, yeah, sure. OK, good, bear with me one second. Right, OK. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that, a bit higher, so I can just see the underside. OK, fantastic, all right. And then, just, bring it round to this side, , I can see other side. OK, fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers. There's, , is it, is it hot, compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin? Yeah. It's a bit warm, yes. It's a bit warmer. OK. Um, and um, is it very tender when you're pressing on that nerve? Is it, if you, if you give it a press, does it hurt you at all? On the, on the tip of the elbow, it's, it's OK, just like, next to it like where the, the swelling is, it's a bit, yeah it feels weird. OK. All right. Um, well, um, I noticed the skin was a bit dry, , on the tip of the elbow. Do you, do you have dry skin anywhere else on the body? Uh, no not really. I have skin really dry now. , do you , do you suffer from eczema at all? No. No. Alright. OK. So um, what I think we should do, with regards to your elbow problem OK. Is um, I think, it would be worthwhile. , this seems like uh, what we call the Bursitis. OK. So, that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. Um, what I think we should do is, I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication, in the, in the first instance. OK. And, as well as that, what I would like to do, is to get some blood tests done, to check for other types of uh, causes of joint swelling. K? Alright. So, um, what we're going to do is, we're going to arrange some, um, blood test forms to be sent out to your house. And, there'll be instructions within that pack, about where to go to get those blood tests done. And, that will involve you, um, having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies. So we'll do a full screen, and also check for things like Gout as well, OK. Um. OK. The time frame for that, will be um, the results will come back to us after about five or six days. Um. K . O From now, but it may take time for the form to come out to you. And if you get the form get the blood tests done straight away, by the time that we're expecting result back, you know one or two days after that, we're looking maybe six days. And, what I would suggest, is, we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you, in one of our clinics, where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood test. OK. Uh, we can um, get a gauge as to, uh, what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now, It doesn't look like, to me that's something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So, we're worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint. Mm-hmm. Um, and uh, your, your joint doesn't look like that. Yeah. However, if your, the elbow was to become very red, very painful, uh, and the redness was to spread or become uh, you know more intense. Then you need to get on the phone or get, have a video appointment , with one of us as soon as possible. OK. 'Cause that would be an emergency. That would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment. OK? do you, do you think it's something dangerous? Like something, like could I die from that, or is it, is it No. I, I don't think this is anything dangerous. don't need to worry. OK? What I'm doing, is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to, to develop. K? So, , this, this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward. OK. Yeah, OK, I see. It's nothing , sinister or life-threatening. Um, what I'm doing is I'm just saying, in case things worsen, these are the things that we'd be looking out for, and this is what we have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully, and I don't think you're going to have it. OK. But I'm just saying, the what if scenario. Is that OK? Yeah that, that sounds good. Thank you. All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me? Um, well just yeah I just wanted to know about this. Um, yeah it feels a bit better now . Uh, but yeah, no that's it. Thank you. OK, all right. Um. OK. So, I, I would take Ibuprofen regularly, OK. You can get that , over the counter. Um, that's four hundred milligrams, two times a day. And you should take, take that after food, not on an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it. OK. OK. Sure. thanks. Bye. All right. So, what I wanna do is, I'll get the forms sent out to you. And, um, we are going to arrange a, a follow-up appointment. Maybe within a um, actually you know, the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face-to-face, if it's more convenient for you do, to do it over the phone, we can do that over the phone, uh, over video. We can do that as well, that's, that's your call. But you contact us, , after you've had the blood test done, and we can review things then, OK. OK. OK, yeah that sounds good. I, I'll do that. And if I see that it's getting worse, I'll probably ask for a physical appointment. Sure, sure that's a good idea. All right then, OK. Um, take care then. So , look just leave that with me, I'll sort all those bits and pieces out, and then we'll get them sent out to you, and then we'll, we'll um, review you after the tests, things goes well, OK. Thank you. Alright. Sounds All right then. Take care then, all the best. Bye bye. Bye.",
      "hypothesis_text": "Hi there, good morning. I'm Dr Dean Mirza from GPA Han. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Okay, before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth? Yes, my name is John Smith and I was born on the fifth of april nineteen seventy three. Okay, that's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes, absolutely. Okay, great. Okay, so tell me a bit about what's been happening. You said you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow. Yeah, I just noticed this like about a week ago or something. I have like a weird swelling on my elbow. I noticed that when I was in the shower. It's not painful at all. I feel fine, but it's just a bit weird to see that. It's slightly warm and I kind of feel like this it's a bit fluid inside or Sure. So I would like to know what's going on basically. And so did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow? It's the left elbow. Left elbow. Okay. And have you banged that elbow? Did you have any kind of injury? No, not really. Not that I know of. I haven't noticed anything. I can actually like move it normally. It's just I can just see that it feels a bit strange. Sure. Okay. And in terms of your job, do you do anything physical? Not really. No, I just, you know, sit at the desk. Right. Yeah. Okay. And has this happened before? No, I haven't noticed that before. I don't have any history of seeing this. I don't remember. Sure. Okay. And can I just double check, has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that? Well, I do well, I think I have something like osteoarthritis. It sometimes kind of hurts my joints, but in my family I'm not sure. Okay, sure. So you said you think you got osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you got osteoarthritis? Yes, just a few years ago. Okay, was that a GP or a specialist or was it a physiotherapist? A GP. GP. Okay, all right. Rick, can I just, sorry, can I just double check how old you are, please? I'm fifty three. fifty three, okay, fantastic, all right. And do you have any other illnesses at all? Well, not really, you know, I'm allergic to peanuts. Okay. That's pretty cool. Are you allergic to any medication? No, not that I know of. Sure. And do you, are you on any medication on a regular basis? No. Okay. And are you normally fit and well? Mobile active? I do, I do, do some sports. I run regularly like two, three times a week. Yeah, no, I'm, I think I'm healthy. Okay, good, good. Glad to hear that. Well done, that's good that you're doing that on a regular basis. Okay. And can I, is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now? Yes, sure. Okay, bear with me one second. Right, okay. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that, a bit higher so I can just see the underside, okay, fantastic. All right. And then just bring it around to this side, essentially, I can see the other side, okay, fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers, is it hot compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin? It's a bit warm, yes. It's a bit warmer, okay. And is it very tender when you're pressing on that now? If you give it a press, does it hurt you at all? On the tip of the elbow, it's okay, just like next to it, like where the swelling is, it's a bit, yeah, it feels a bit fluid. Okay, all right. Well, I noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow. Do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body? No, not really. Do you suffer from eczema at all? No. No, all right. Okay, so what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem, okay, is I think it would be worthwhile. This seems like what we call the bursitis, okay? So that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. What I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti inflammatory medication in the first instance. And as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of causes of joint swelling, okay? So what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some blood test forms to be sent out to your house and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done. And that will involve you having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies. So we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well. Okay. The timeframe for that will be the results will come back to us after about five, six days from now. We take time for the forms to come out to you and if you get the forms that test done straight away, by the time that we're expecting a result back one or two days after that, we're looking at maybe six days. And what I'd suggest is we can arrange a follow up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood tests and we can get a gauge as to what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now, it doesn't look like to me like something called septic arthritis. So we are worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint and your joint doesn't look like that. However, if the elbow was to become very red, very painful and the redness was to spread or become more intense, then you need to get on the phone or have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment. Okay? Do you think it's something dangerous? Like something like can I date from that? Or is it No, I don't think this is anything dangerous. Don't need to worry. Okay? What I'm doing is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop. Okay? So if things were to worsen, this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward. It's nothing sinister or life threatening. What I'm doing is I'm just saying, in case things worsen, these are the things that we'd be looking out for and that's what we have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully. And I don't think you're going to have it. But I'm just saying the what if scenario. Is that OK? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me? Well, just wanted to know about this. Yeah, it feels a bit better now to know that. OK, all right. Yeah, no, that's it. Thank you. Okay, so I would take ibuprofen regularly. Okay, you can get that over the counter. That's four hundred milligrams three times a day. And you should take that after food, not on an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it. Okay? Sure. All right. So what I want to do is I'll get the form sent out to you and we are going to arrange a follow up appointment maybe within actually, you know, the follow up appointment doesn't have to be face to face. It's more convenient to do it over the phone. We can do that over the phone, video. You can do that as well. That's your call.

And if I see that it's getting worse, I'll probably ask for a physical appointment. Sure. That's a good idea. All right then. Okay. Take care then. So just leave that with me. I'll sort all those bits and pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll review you after the tests. Things go well. Sure. All right. All right, then. Take care then. All the best. Bye bye."

Have you lost weight? Yes. Can you remember how much you've lost? Five pounds. And, is that because you're going to the gym? Or is that unintentional? It's not intentional, no. OK.

And have you ever, taken any, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, like Ibuprofen, Naproxen, anything like that? Um, I have in the past, I haven't been taking it, last few days. OK. Um, so, this headache is new to you, and you've, you've not had regular headaches before? Yeah. What I would, suggest is, taking, uh, um, some anti-inflammatories, along with the Paracetamol. OK. Um, as a. Uh, you said you're eating OK? Yeah, yeah, fine. I mean it, from the sounds of it, it does, sound quite like a migraine, but obviously if you had no history of that, in the past. Um, and is anything changed recently, or any, anything you've done recently might've, triggered it? Uh, not that I can think of, um, may have been a bit stressed out at work, that kind of thing, but . Yeah. Um, well that would be the first thing to do, is to take some anti-inflammatories along with the Paracetamol. Make sure you're really well hydrated. Um, and, see how that goes, and if it, if it isn't settling, or it's getting worse, or you get any other change in your headache. Um, or you're unwell with it, with a high temperature, then we would certainly need to speak to you. Straight away about that. The other thing is if you, if you're getting persistent, um, headaches, or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle, or certain things seem to trigger these headaches. Then, it, it would be worth, having a further discussion about it, to see whether we can, work out if we can help the, that longer-term. OK, brilliant, thank you. Um, I would, try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked, if you haven't had it checked for a while. Uh, and, thing to do is to have a thermometer at home, so you can make sure that your temperature's OK. OK, sure. Yep. If you have a raised temperature or, your headache's just getting worse, or you develop any rashes or anything like that. Then we'd need to speak to you straight away. Yep, OK, that's brilliant.

I would say, less than a storm, something like that. So about a stone, yeah? Six months, OK. OK. , OK. Right, OK. So, just a few more questions. It might seem a bit awkward, but it's quite relevant.

Uh, trying to eat something, but don't really want to. Yeah, um, your bowels. How's your toilet? Uh. That's OK, I would say.

Like, to be very more specific, you don't have any diarrhoea? Uh, no. No diarrhoea. No,no . OK, so there's blood in the poo no mucus nothing of that sort? Uh. Uh, no, no, nothing. Just now, you mentioned nausea. Have you been ever sick with it? No, actually not. Uh, . Yeah I'm feeling not well, uh, in the, in the, in the bowel region, yeah. OK, well just the nausea, OK. Is there any particular foods that make you nauseous? Nauseous. No, nothing. OK. So you can't think of any real.... Do you suffer from acid reflux? I do not, no. OK, OK. You also mentioned that you're feeling short of breath so yeah is there any cough? Um, no, not really just, just OK. It's like when, when when I go into the lift, uh, it, it happens to be that, uh, I like, you know, my heart starts beating and I can't really breath, uh Yeah. Is it like in closed spaces? No, it happens every time. It happens very significantly in, in the lift or when I'm, when I'm So, how far can you walk and when you start feeling short of breath? So how far can you walk with no shortness of breath? Um. Walk or run. Walk, you start with walk. Do you feel short of breathlet's start this way, do you feel short of uh breath when you walk at all? No, actually not. Right. You so you can walk about a mile and you don't feel short of breath at all. That's right, yes. OK, so just explain a bit more just make myself clear about the lift thing. So you said you're short of breath when you're in the lift? Yeah, my heart starts beating. I, I feel like I can't breathe and, and, uh, it's, it's very difficult too. Uh yeah, two twenty nine. Uh, it's going, yeah just, just that you, you know, when, when you just feel unwell, and yeah, your heart starts beating. described them like palpitations to me, yeah? So that's what you're, you're feeling your own heartbeat. Yep Yeah, OK. You get any chest pains with it? Not really, no. It's just that OK. OK, no chest pains. I'm up. No chest pain. OK. Alright. Fine. So, what we need to do, um, just before that, um, just a few more things. Uh, any any past medical history you'd like to share with me today? Uh, yes. I had too little activity of my thyroid, uh. Sorry you had thyroid problems. Thyroid. Too little activity, yes. Ohh yeah, underactive thyroid, yes. Yep. Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, and in, in In view of that, I took thyroxine. Yeah, you're taking thyroxine? Are you using it every day? Uh, not anymore. Why is that? Uh, I have, I have not been taking it in the last, actually since I changed doctor, I would say. OK, so is that, so all these things are since you've stopped taking the thyroxine? Ohh. That might be coinciding, I'm not sure about that. When was your last blood test? Uh, haven't taken one in a long time. OK, so you've not had a blood test. Mm hmm Right, OK. It could, you know, generally for you know for underactive thyroids what symptoms you've said um it's the opposite that usually happens, yeah. It's for overactive thyroid like you can feel a bit like the racing of your heart beat and all so I'm not quite clear on what picture we are having here. Yeah? OK. I think a general set of bloods is a good , good start. So what we look at, because you're not, you're not having the umph, aren't you? You're like, you're just feeling a bit, you know low and things like that, right? Well, um, and weak and things like that. So we'll just do a general set of bloods. we look at things like anaemia, how your kidney functions are, your livers, all that, with vitamin levels, and your . OK. yes. No problem. OK. And uh, now after we get those set of bloods, we will find out if we can find anything in them. If that's all clear, then we would need to do a physical examination. OK? Uh huh Okay. We would need to then go in and do . But there's nothing from what your history you've said that, that we urgently warrant a physical examination at this point in time. I think it's a good idea to start off with a blood test, and then take it from there. OK. Obviously with palpitations or chest pain, if you get that's more of a medical emergency. You need to go to A and E for that. OK? If things change, you've mentioned now your bowels are fine, and you're not being sick. So if that's the case it's OK, but if your, you know, bowels change or you're being sick again, you need to get in touch with us. OK? OK, I have, I haven't been walking lately at all. I haven't, yes. I haven't been walking lately at all so like, it's really hard for me to identify when I feel the shortness of breath. Sorry? Could you repeat that? Mm-hmm. Uh, just wanted to add that into , because, um, I haven't been walking. I haven't been feeling good enough for a good at all. So, yep. OK. So let's do all the blood tests first and we'll take it from there. OK? But you know, if you have any chest pains, or change in bowel habits, do get in touch with us. Thank you. I will, yes. OK. Now what we need to do is now you need to ring up support. And I'll the form for you, but in the interim you need to call support so that we can organise that blood test for you. And when you get the result, you will receive a text message through your phone to tell you to book an appointment. If you're feeling poorly, don't wait for that. Just get in touch with us again, yeah? Uh huh. OK. Can I I will. How do I call to report? Ohh, there's a number on your app, yeah? If you open up your app there's the number on there.

Are you the doctor? Um, I'm, contacting you because I've been, quite short of breath lately. OK. Do you want to tell me a bit more about it? When did it all start? Uh, well it seems to have been, slowly getting worse over the last couple of weeks. Um, now it's, become quite troublesome, in the last few days. Uh, I kind of, normally I can walk to the shops, without a problem but, now I'm having to sort of sit down and catch my breath. And I'm really starting to get a bit breathless, just about the house. And uh, it's got me kind of worried, don't really know what's going on. OK. OK. OK. Is there anything you're particularly worried about? Um, well, I've, I've uh, I've got um, heart failure. OK. Uh, I was told that, uh, a while ago. Um, and I got a bit breathless when I was first diagnosed, and put on some medicine that, that um, that helped, but I'm a bit worried it's just getting worse. OK. Right. Right, OK. So you mentioned you're feeling, uh, short of breath for the last couple of weeks, but mainly the last couple of days it's got a bit worse. Um, uh, and you're now feeling more breathless on kind of minimal, minimal exertion you mentioned. Um, have you noticed any other symptoms at all, uh, uh, with your breath? So, for example, any pain in your chest? No pain in my chest. OK. And have you found yourself coughing, coughing at all? Um. Uh, I've got a bit of a dry cough, but it's not too troublesome. OK. OK. And how's your general health otherwise? Are you feeling uh, weak, lethargic? Um, I'm feeling a little run-down, um, but otherwise, otherwise pretty normal. OK.

Yeah, it's a bit embarrassing. Both ankles? OK. Uh, I can imagine, yeah. Um, and again, over how long has this, have you noticed this for? Um, I kind of noticed it the last few days. Past few days, OK. And is this something that you've had before, in the past? Uh, I think my ankles did swell up a bit last time, the heart failure was a problem. OK. OK. Um, fine. OK. So, um, just to really recap, uh, so you're really, in the last couple of weeks, uh, you've been feeling breathless, uh, but worse in the last couple of days. You mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough. Um, and some swelling in your ankles. Um, reporting no chest pain. Um, and, and have you had any, have you any, have you noticed your heartbeat racing at all? So, palpitations or skipped heartbeat? No, not really. OK. And any temperatures or fevers? Uh, no. OK. And how about your appetite? Are you eating and drinking OK? Yeah, I, , I'm, that's fine. OK. And your waterworks? Are you passing urine OK? Uh, yeah, but yeah. I usually pee a lot, , ever since the drugs . Yeah. Sure, OK. Alright. Um, fine. So, your uh, your past medical history. You mentioned heart failure. Any, any other medical history I should be aware of? Uh, well I was told I had like a, they called it like a small heart attack. About, five years ago. Um, I uh, I had, I, I had like some chest pain and, they took me into hospital. OK. And um, they, uh, but then I just got better. OK. And when, when you say a small heart attack, did they give you a name, for what happened, a, a name of a diagnosis? Um. Uh, I can't remember. They just called it something a , uh, something like that, a small heart attack. It's more hard to say. OK. Was it like angina or, um, Um. Uh, no they, they said that it, uh, it seemed, it was like, more than angina. OK. Um, uh, but um, I didn't, but I only had to stay in hospital for a few days, and, uh. OK. OK. And yeah, I've been OK since then. You've been OK since then. OK, alright. So, apart from the uh, the heart, the heart problems, the heart failure, any other problems I should be aware of? Uh, no, I think I'm otherwise, I'm OK. OK. Um, do you take any regular medications, apart from your diuretics that you're taking? And do you know which ones? Uh, yeah, I take something called Furosemide. . Do you know which dose you're taking? I can't remember, I'm sorry doctor. I have to check. That's OK. No problems. Um, Any other medications? Uh, yeah. I take Aspirin. OK. And uh, Bisoprolol. The Metoprolol, was it? Or? Uh, Bisoprolol. Sorry, the connection's not very good. OK. Thank you, yeah. Um, . And a thousand, OK. Alright. Any allergies at all? Any medications? Uh, no, no allergies. No. OK. And is there anything in the family that's, uh, that, that's uh, that's important for me to know? Any family history of medical problems, heart problems, lung problems? Uh , my, my father died of a, uh, of a heart attack. I'm sorry to hear that. And, um, how old was your father when he passed away? Uh, he was, um, early sixties. Early sixties, OK. Alright. Anything else I should be aware of? Um, my mother had osteoporosis. OK. Is your mother still with us? Uh, yeah, she's still living. OK, alright. Um, and socially, sir, just tell me a bit more about your situation at home. Who lives at home with you? Uh, I live on my own. Well, I got two cats. You've got two cats. OK, great. Do they have names? They're my family. Uh, they're, they're called, um, they're called, Polly and Tim. OK. Um, so it's just you and your cats. And um, in terms of day to day, are you working at the moment? Uh, I work part-time as, a, uh, lorry driver. OK. And how is that? Is that quite stressful, long hours? Uh, it's OK. Um, I uh, yeah , when I'm working it's pretty exhausting. Mm. Um, I guess I'm a bit worried, that if I get sick I won't, if I get more sick then, I won't be able to work properly. Yeah, that's certainly a consideration, isn't it? So let's, let's try and get you better soon, so it doesn't have any um, impact on your, on your job. No. Uh, and do you find yourself doing a lot of anti-social hours? Do you , do you do a lot of night driving, weekend driving? Ohh no, I , I , I, I only take shifts during the day, I don't like working at night. OK. OK, alright. And what about smoking and alcohol? So, 'cause that can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems. Do you, do you smoke at all? Not any more. So, you used to smoke? Yeah. And how many did you smoke a day, on average? Ooh it was about, about a pack a day, back in the day. Um, and how many, how many years was that for? Ohh that was, oof, good twenty five years. OK. And what about the stopping? That must have been difficult for you. stopping. Um, and what, what about alcohol? I don't drink alcohol. OK. Do you do much in the way of exercise, sir? Uh, I try and walk to the shops, at least once a day. OK. Um, but uh, that's about it, I've. Yeah, I don't, I don't go running like I used to when i was young. OK. Right, OK. And certainly now your symptoms, you, you're, you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the uh, to the shop, she said. Um, right. Ohh um, based on your, based on you history, and having listened to your story, I, I wonder whether you've had a flare-up of your heart failure, sir. Um, Which can sometimes happen. Um, um, and uh, Mmm. That. It's . So, it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be. Um, and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure, there's obviously What's going on. Um, that's the first thing that comes to my mind. Um, now there's a couple of options move forward. Um, Mmm. Given that you're otherwise well at the moment, and having examined you, your chest, and your saturations and blood pressure are all OK, I'm quite happy to increase your dose of Furosemide. Maybe, rather than one tablet a day, we can do two tablets a day, for the first few days. Um, and see, and see how you're getting on. OK. If you think that'll be better. Uh, I think, I think, it's, it's, it's definitely worth treating your symptoms. But what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test, and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart, to see how well your heart's pumping. OK. Is that something you've had before? Yeah, so um, an , it's a, it's a general scan of your heart. You might have had this done before, when you were diagnosed. And it's just to get a good What does that? Ohh yes, I remember now. Sorry? Uh, yeah, I remember now. . You remember that. OK, fine. That's something I can organize for you today. And, and that might take a week or two weeks for that to be organized. But, I think certainly in the meantime, let's, um, Let's, let's get a blood test done. We can check your um, you know your full blood count, look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function. Um, and we can definitely increase your um, your Furosemide, uh, to you know, one tablet twice a day. But I really like, would like you to come back and see me in about a week's time, see how you're getting on. That sound reasonable? I think that sounds like a good plan. And of course, in the meantime if you are getting more unwell, feel like you're getting more breathless, or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain, or palpitations or dizziness, then, uh, you know I want you to give me a call sooner than that, and we can have a chat on the phone as well. OK. I'll see how I get on. OK? Do you have any questions for me? Uh, I think that's all pretty clear. Thank you very much Doctor. Great, and then well I wish you all the best! Have a good day. OK. Thank you. OK. See you soon.",
      "hypothesis_text": "Hello. Hello there. Hello, can you hear me okay? Yes, I can hear you. Okay, great. Are you the doctor? I am, yes. Dr Suede here, Oscar. How can I help you this afternoon? I'm contacting you because I've been quite short of breath lately. Okay. Do you want to tell me a bit more about that? When did it all start? Well, it seems to have been slowly getting worse over the last couple of weeks. It's become quite troublesome in the last few days. Normally I can walk to the shops without a problem, but now I'm having to sort of sit down and catch my breath and I'm even starting to get a bit breathless just about the house and it's got me kind of worried. I don't really know what's going on. Okay, okay. Is there anything you're particularly worried about? Well, I've got heart failure. Okay. I was told that a while ago. And I got a bit breathless when I was first diagnosed. Right. And put on some medicine that helped, but I'm a bit worried it's just getting Right, okay. So you mentioned you've been feeling short of breath for the last couple of weeks, but maybe the last couple of days has got a bit worse and you're now feeling more breathless on kind of minimal exertion you mentioned. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all with your breath? So for example, any pain in your chest? No pain in my chest. Okay. Have you found yourself coughing at all? I've got a bit of a dry cough but it's not too troublesome. Okay, okay. And how's your general health otherwise? Are you feeling weak, lethargic? I'm feeling a little run down but otherwise pretty normal. I've noticed my ankles have gotten a bit bigger. Okay, and what do you mean by that? It's just like they've sort of swollen up a bit. Okay. Is that both ankles? Both ankles? Yeah, both ankles. Yeah, it's a bit embarrassing. Okay, I can imagine, yeah. And again, over how long has this have you noticed this for? I kind of noticed it the last few days. Last few days, okay. And is this something that you've had before in the past? I think my ankles did swell up a bit last time the heart failure was a problem. Okay, okay. Fine, okay. So just to really recap, so really the last couple of weeks you've been feeling breathless but worse in the last couple of days. You mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough and some swelling in your ankles. But importantly, no chest pain. And have you noticed your heartbeat racing at all? So palpitations or skipped heartbeat? No, not really. Okay. And any temperatures or fevers? No. Okay. And how about your appetite? Are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, that's fine. Okay. And your water works, are you passing urine okay? Yeah, yeah. I usually pee a lot. Yeah. The drugs. Sure, okay, all right. Fine, so moving on to your past medical history, you mentioned heart failure. Any other medical history I should be aware of? Well, I was told I had like a, they called it like a small heart attack about five years ago. I had like some chest pain and they took me to hospital. Okay. And they but then I just got better. Okay. When you say small heart attack, did they give you a name for what happened? A name of a diagnosis? I can't remember. They just called it something like that, a small heart attack. Small heart attack, okay. Was it like angina or? No, they said it seemed it was like more than angina. Okay. But I only had to stay in hospital for a few days. Okay. And yeah, I've been okay since then. You've been okay since then. Okay, all right. So apart from the heart problems, the heart failure, any other problems I should be aware of? No, I think I'm otherwise, I'm okay. Okay. Do you take any regular medications apart from your diuretics that you're taking? Do you know which ones? Yeah, I take something called ferozamide. And do you know which dose you're taking? I can't remember, I'm sorry, doctor. I have to check. No problems. Any other medications? Yeah, I take aspirin and loprilol. That metoprilol was it? Or loprilol. Sorry, the connection is not very good. Okay, thank you. Yep. Simbastatin. Simbastatin, okay. All right. Any allergies at all? Any medications? No, no allergies. Okay. And is there anything in the family that's important for me to know, any family history of medical problems, heart problems, lung problems? My father died of a heart attack. I'm sorry to hear that. How old was your father when he passed away? He was early sixties. Early sixties, okay. Anything else I should be aware of? My mother had osteoporosis. Okay. Is your mother still with us? Yes, she's still living. Okay. All right. And socially, sir, just tell me a bit more about your situation at home. Who lives at home with you? I live on my own. I've got two cats. You've got two cats. Okay, great. Do they have names? They're my family. They're called Holly and Tim. Okay. So this is you and your cats. And in terms of day to day, are you working at the moment? I work part time as a lorry driver. Okay, and how is that? Is that quite stressful, long hours? It's okay. When I'm working, it's pretty exhausting. I guess I'm a bit worried that if I get sick, I won't if I get more sick then I won't be able to work properly. Yeah, this is certainly a consideration isn't there. So let's let's try and get you better soon so it doesn't have any impact on your on your job. And do you find yourself doing a lot of antisocial hours? Do you do a lot of night driving, weekend driving? No, I try to only take shifts during the day. I don't like working at night. Okay. All right. And what about smoking and alcohol, so because they can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems. Do you smoke at all? Not anymore. So you used to smoke? Yeah. And how many did you smoke a day on average? Oh, it was about a pack a day back in the day. And how many years was that for? Oh, that was good twenty five years. Okay. Well done for stopping. It must be very difficult for you. Well done for stopping. And what about alcohol? I don't drink alcohol. Okay. Do you do much in the way of exercise, sir? I try and walk the shops at least once a day. Okay. But that's about it. I don't go running like I used to when I was young. Right, okay. And certainly now with your symptoms, you said you're feeling more breathless, even walking to the shops, you said. Right, so based on your history and having listened to your story, I wonder whether you've had a bit of a flare up of your heart failure, sir, which can sometimes happen. What's going on? So, it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be. And obviously having diagnosed with heart failure, there's obviously, it's the first thing that comes to my mind. Now, there's a couple of options to move forward. Given that you're otherwise well at the moment and having examined you, your chest and your saturations and blood pressure all okay, I'm quite happy to increase your dose of fruzamide. So maybe rather than one tablet a day, we can give you two tablets a day for the first few days and see how you're getting on. Okay, I think that would be best. I think it's definitely worth treating your symptoms. But what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart to see how well your heart's pumping. Okay. Is that something you've had? Yeah, so an echo scan, it's a jelly scan of your heart. You may have had it done before when you were diagnosed and it's just to get a good sorry. Yeah, I remember now. Okay, fine. That's something I can organise for you today and it may take a week or two weeks for that to be organised. But I think certainly in the meantime, let's get a blood test done. We can check your full blood can, look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function. And we can definitely increase your freezamide to one tablet twice a day. But I really like we'd like you to come back and see me in about a week's time to see how you're getting on. Does that sound reasonable? I think that sounds like a good plan. And of course, in the meantime, if you are getting more unwell, so if you're feeling more breathless or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness, then you know, said I want you to give me a call sooner than that and we can have a chat on the phone as well. Okay, I'll see how I get on. Okay, do you have any questions for me? That's all pretty clear. Thank you very much, Doctor. Great. And then I wish you all the best. Have a good day. See you soon. Okay, thank you."

And, your asthma, did it resolve when you were a child? Uh, I think mostly, yeah. I mean, sometimes when I, um, run for, like, long periods, it can, it can start up a bit. But, um, I have, uh, I have, like, an asthma inhaler. I use that. OK. So, do you still have your inhalers? Um, I think I might have one from, like, a couple of months ago. OK. Um. But, you don't see your doctor regularly for asthma? Uh, no, I don't. OK. And, apart from this, do you know if you're allergic to anything? Uh, not that I know of. OK.

Can you still hear me? Um, yeah. We just turned off. So, given you've got a history of asthma and hay fever. This could be one of two things. But, we want to rule out asthma or an allergy first. So, what you'll need is visit one of our clinics, so we can do some more tests. OK. Such as check your . OK. Well what sort? So, the first thing we would do, is use a small device on your finger, to check the amount of oxygen in your blood. OK. And, from that we can tell if it's asthma or something else. Right, OK. Before this happens, if you've got something, like an antihistamine, which you normally take for hay fever at home, I would take one, just in case it is an allergy you've had from the dust. OK. Uh, yeah. I don't have any antihistamines at home, unfortunately. You might be able to get one on your way to the doctor's surgery. If not, they can prescribe you one. OK, OK. So, I can just get it over the counter then? Yes. And it, they're normally about four to six pounds. Great. Is there anything else that you're particularly worried about, you want to ask me? Um, um, not really. I mean. I have, before, taken steroids for asthma. Um, I don't know if that's relevant. Yes, that is. And, you may need to take some steroids now. But, we cannot, we, we won't be able to know until we've done those tests first. OK, OK. Cool. So, I'm gonna write a letter for your GP, just to let him know what's happened.

Twenty six, OK. And how can I help you this afternoon? Um, so basically, I've been really stressed at work for the past few days. And, I've realised that I've got, really dry itchy skin. OK. Um, sorry to hear work's been so stressful. Um. Tell me more about your skin first, Lou. Tell me uh, you mentioned it's been dry and itchy. Um, whereabouts on your skin? All over my arms, um, and my hands mainly. OK. Um, and is this something you've had before? Uh, no. Never had . So, uh, did it, did it come about quite suddenly, or was it more, kind of a gradual thing? I think it started a few days ago. OK. And, has this spread anywhere else? Has it spread to your, to your chest, your legs, your face? No, OK. So apart from being dry and itchy, um, any other symptoms? Has it been sore? Has it been, uh, have you noticed any cracked skin? Um, so my skin's quite red, um, and I'm using coconut butter for the past few days. OK. Has that. I don't have any spots, and no fever , and I'm not sweating either. OK. Thank you, for mentioning all those. Um, OK. Uh, so the coconut butter hasn't helped, with the itch? No, . OK. And, uh, you mentioned work's been quite stressful. What do you do for work? Um, I work as a teacher. OK. And, uh, in what way has work been stressful? I think the kids have been really annoying these days. OK. . And, I've been working really long hours. OK, all right. Well I'm sorry to hear that, and I hope it gets better. Um, going back to your skin. I mean is it anything you've done perhaps, uh, which may have triggered your symptoms? Anything you've touched or, you know, for example shower gels, soaps, fabric , fabric cleaners? , I went swimming a few days ago. OK. Is that the first time in your life or have you been before? Uh, no, I've been before. OK. And did your symptoms start after you went swimming? Uh, yes, . OK, all right. Um, you mentioned you've had no other fevers, is that right? No fevers? No vomiting? No. No. How's your health otherwise? It's pretty good, yeah. I'm not on any medication. And all , we'll get to medication in just a second. Um, , do you, do you feel generally run-down? Do you feel tired? Uh, yeah, I think I have been, quite tired. OK, OK. Are you eating and drinking OK? Yeah, I've been drinking, and eating as normal. Your appetite's fine is it? OK. And your bowels, are your bowels working OK? Yeah. Uh, no, no problems with vomiting, or loose stools? No. OK. And your waterworks are uh, all OK? You're passing urine OK? Yep. OK, all right. Um, so just moving on. In terms of your other medical history, is there anything else I should be aware of? I'm currently taking . Microgynon. Yeah. OK. Do you know what that is? Uh, no. OK. , it's a contraceptive pill Does that make sense? Is that something you're, is that, does that ring a bell now? Ohh yeah. OK. Is there, any other medications that you take? Uh, no. No. So, in terms of your medical history, there's no, problems of skin problems in the past, things like eczema or, um, dermatitis? Uh, no, I think it might just be the weather. Sorry what was that? You think it's. The . I think it might just be the weather. The weather? Yeah, . Ohh, you think the , OK. You think the weather, OK. OK. No that's OK, no, no problems. Well um, uh, move . Do you, do you suffer from allergies? Are you someone who suffers from allergies? Um. Food allergies? Medication allergies? I think, um, I might be lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerant, OK, that could be helpful to know. Um, fine. And tell me of family history, is there anything in the family that you're aware of? Um, yeah, so um, my dad has asthma, and, my mum has hayfever. Hayfever, OK. Um, fine, but any, again, any skin problems that you're aware of? Yep. Uh, no. No, OK, all right. Socially, who do you live with at home? Ohh, it's just me. Live alone? Yep. And, uh, do you smoke at all? Do you, can I ask? Do you smoke? Are you a smoker? Uh, no, I don't smoke. Do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Uh, no. Recreational drugs? No. OK. And you said you , you work as a primary school teacher? Yes, that's right. Uh , the reason I ask is sometimes stress can be a , contributing factor. Um, you felt, you noticed yourself, find, uh, , life's been more stressful recently. Is that right? Do you think that might have any correlation to your symptoms? I don't. I certainly think so. OK, all right. Um, fine. Um. OK, well, normally at this stage I like to proceed to examination, but um, based on your uh, story. Um, it's difficult. I think that, you know, , you've, essentially the story is you've got a dry itchy rash on your, mainly your hands. you mentioned. Um and your arms which started, perhaps after swimming a few days ago. Um, but no other symptoms, you're feeling otherwise, well, no fevers, no bleeding or discharge from skin. Yep. I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis. Um, have you heard of that condition before? I have, yeah. OK. Um, great. Well I can give you a patient information leaflet about that, which gives a bit more information about the disease, but, um, it, it's something that we can readily treated. Um. With couple options, we have steroid creams I can give you, um, which will help with the inflammation. And, uh, something called emollients, which can help with the dry, dry skin. And that's something you just need to kind of paste on, uh, on to your skin, uh, , throughout the day for the next few days. Um, and hopefully that helps your symptoms. OK, it's cool. Thank you very much. Um, , you can also try antihistamines, so you can get things over the counter, Piriton, Loratadine, they can sometimes help with the itchiness. Yeah, that sounds good. OK. And um, that's probably what I recommend. Paracetamol on this occasion, wouldn't be helpful. Um, uh, uh, painkillers wouldn't be helpful , on this occasion, but let's, let's, let's see how the next few days go. And if it's still not getting better, come back and see me next week, and we can have another look again, at your symptoms. OK, perfect. Thank you very much. Right. Do you have any questions for me? Uh, no. OK. Well, I wish you all the best. Have a good day. Well, thank you very much. Bye. Thank you. Bye bye.",

We'll get to medication in just a second. Do you feel genuinely run down? Do you feel tired? Yeah, I think I have been quite tired. Okay. Are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, I've been drinking and eating as normal. Your appetite's fine, is it okay. And your bowels, are your bowels working okay? Yeah. No problems with vomiting or loose stools? No. Okay, and your water works are all okay, your pasta urine okay? Yeah. Okay, all right. So just moving on, in terms of your other medical history, is there anything else I should be aware of? I'm currently taking Microgen. Microgynol? Yeah. Okay, do you know what that is? No. Okay, it's a contraceptive pill. Does that make sense? Is that something you does that ring a bell now? Oh yeah. Okay. Is it any other medications that you take? Oh no. No. So in terms of your medication, there's no problems of skin problems in the past, things like eczema or dermatitis? No, I think it might just be the weather. Sorry, what was that? You think it's I think it might just be the weather? The weather? Yeah. Oh, you think the weather? Okay, you think the weather? Okay. No problems. Well, um, moving and do you suffer from allergies? Are you someone who suffers from allergies? Um, allergies, medication allergies. I think, um, I'm lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerant, okay, that could be helpful to know. Um, fine. in terms of family history, is there anything in the family that you're aware of? Yeah, so my dad has asthma and my mum has hay fever. Hay fever? Yeah. Okay, fine, but any, again, any skin problems I should be aware of? No. No, okay, all right. Socially, who do you live with at home? It's just me. You live alone? Yep. And do you smoke at all? Can I ask, do you smoke? Are you a smoker? No, I don't. Do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No. Recreational drugs? Yep. Okay. And you said you meant you work as a primary school teacher? Yes, that's right. The reason I ask is sometimes stress can be a contributing factor. You felt you noticed yourself finding life's been more stressful recently, right? Do you feel that might have any correlation to your symptoms? I mean, I don't think so. Okay, all right. Fine. Okay, well, normally at this stage I like to proceed to examination, but based on your story, it's difficult. I think, you know, essentially the story is you've got a dry, itchy rash on your hands, you mentioned, and your arms, which started perhaps after swimming a few days ago. But no other symptoms, you're feeling otherwise well, no fevers, no bleeding or discharge from skin. I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis. Have you heard of that condition before? I have, yeah. Okay. Great. Well, I can give you a patient information leaflet about that which gives a bit more information about the disease, but it's something that we can readily treated with a couple of options. We have steroid creams I can give you, which will help with the inflammation and something called emollients which can help with the dry skin and that's something you just need to kind of paste onto your skin throughout the day for the next few days and hopefully that helps your symptoms. Okay cool, thank you very much. You can also try antihistamines so you can get things over the counter, pyritin, leratidine that can sometimes help with the itchiness. Yeah that sounds good. Okay and that's probably why I recommend paracetamol on this occasion wouldn't be helpful painkillers wouldn't be helpful on this occasion but let's see how the next few days go and if it's still not getting better come back and see me next week and we can have another look again at your symptoms. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Great. Do you have any questions for me? No. Okay. Well, I wish you all the best. Have a good day. Oh, thank you very much. Bye."

      "reference_text": "Hi. Hi there. It's Doctor Smith from Babylon. Hi Doctor Smith. Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth, and your home address please? Hi Doctor Smith. Yes. My name is Mary Jo. Date of birth is January first, nineteen eighty. And my address is uh, sixty Sloane Avenue, London. OK, I, are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today? Absolutely. What can I do for you? So, a couple of things. I, I, think I may have, overdone my workouts, and now my knees are hurting, and they're clicking a lot, and it's starting to worry me. Um, I can't run very far, um, any more without just feeling, pain in my knees. And then, sometimes I also get this weird tingling in my toes. Um. So yeah, that's, that's it. I'm just concerned and I figured you know I'd call and, see if you can, help me figure out what's going on. OK, that's fine. So when do you think it started? So probably, it's been about two weeks. OK. Um, and, any joint problems before that? You know not, not really. I mean I play a lot of sports. Um, and I had a , like I play some ice hockey, and I had this injury a few months ago. You know I just like, fell on the ice and, and, you know had a, huge bruise but, I think that's about it. OK, So, um, at the moment, just tell me about the exercise that you're doing, normally. So I'm training, well, I'm currently training for a marathon, um, that's gonna happen in, June. And so, I'm trying to run like. I mean right now, I'm actually not even doing such long runs, maybe like seven or eight miles. And so, I started about uh, maybe a month ago. Uh, I've done like, you know, four or five miles, and I've just done like a couple of seven, mile runs. And then uh, uh, and then you know I go to the gym like few times a week and, kinda do my, usual routine. Um, but, yeah, I think the only thing that's really different has, have been, the runs, the longer runs. And, have you had, any times when the knee feels like it's giving way underneath you? Um, well, I, what do you mean by that? I'm not sure what, what that means. So, it means if you're, if you're there and uh, you just feel it sort of jolt, like give way, feel unstable underneath you. Not, not bad, I mean it just kinda starts hurting, you know. Um. And does it hurt, uh, how far into the run does it generally hurt? You know I would say probably starts off like after, uh, maybe, twenty minutes or so. Which is, probably I don't know like somewhere around mile, three maybe, two and a half or three miles. OK. Ooh you're fast. Um. switching my kilometres and miles, I'm not sure, all right. Um. And, um, do you have to stop running, or can you run through the pain? Yeah, that is a good question. So, um, you know the last few times, the last time I actually stopped, I mean I ran a little bit longer, but then I stopped, because it was um, I, I feel like it's getting worse. OK. Um, and, when I start doing my abs, that's, you know when I do my abs. It's kind of requiring me to move my you know, um, to kind of go from the flex position on my knees, and straighten my legs, then I feel all this clicking. OK. And, I think that's also freaked me out, and uh, I just figured you know, something's wrong here. Right. And, you said before, it's both knees. So it's more, um, it's actually my right knee that hurts. And, any problems with your left one? No. OK, and, can you just describe in the knee, or show me whereabouts the pain, is happening mainly? So, ah, you know I, I feel it, it's kind of weird, I feel it in the middle, but I almost feel like maybe it kind of uh, um, moves to the right, to the right of my knee a little bit. OK. Have you noticed any tenderness when you press over any areas in the knee? So, yes, well it's, I have, probably some fluid. I googled it, and you know it says that sometimes fluid accumulates uh, I. OK. , does it look swollen to you? Sorry? Does the knee look swollen? Um, well it did, like, the first time I ran, it was a little bit swollen, but then I just put some like ice on it, and it went away. Um, but, right now, right now it's not swollen, and right now it doesn't hurt, you know. Um, but, it just kind of comes on when uh, um, or you know right now when I flex and extend my leg, it, there's no clicking but, I'll notice it in the gym and then, you know, when I run it'll start hurting. OK, and, if you're sitting, still for a while, do you have any problems when you stand up, any locking up of the knee? No. Can't straighten it. Any problems going up and down stairs? No. Any problems just walking normally? No, none, I don't. And intervals of range of movement. Are you able to fully straighten the leg? Yes. And what about fully flex it? Yes. OK. Are you taking any medication for the knee? Well, um, since you're asking. Um, yes I , I take Ibuprofen, um, and I'll just kinda, use it sometime like uh, um, like sometimes I have some joint issues, but you know, that kind of, is not very frequent. So I'll take Ibuprofen for that. But you know it's nothing like major maybe, like, four hundred milligrams max, something like that. I also sometimes will um, you know, smoke a joint. Um, and, yeah, other than that, that's it. OK, and any other joint problems, that you're getting? Any back pains? Small swelling of your, hands, feet, elbows, wrists? Any pain? No. Uh, well I have sometimes, you know how sometimes like if you stand for a long time, your feet will kinda, or your legs will swell up. Like I noticed it because of my socks, I'll just kind of, notice this indentation. OK. And then, another weird thing. I've felt this just once, but there was this tingling in my toes, like uh, um, after the run. There was tingling in my toes like on my, you know my right toes, um, so. On your right side. Yes. Any change in colour, or temperature of your lower legs? No. Any swelling which stays if you push in, and then you release it, that it stays there? Well I don't know if I really try that, but I, I will tell you that, what I noticed is like if I, you know when my socks come off, I kind of notice that indentation a little bit, I mean it's not like major, right but, I. Uh, I mean do you mean I just need to like press and see what happens, if it like kind of stays or, . Yeah, any, or any pain in the back of the calf or anything like that? No, no, nothing like that, no. Um, and, with your foot, has that gone back to normal now? Do you feel any altered senstation, tingling numbness, anything like that? No it was just, it was that time, uh, but it was just really weird, because it kind of went on for a while. OK.And any pain in the joints of your foot or , on the underside in the arch? Any problems walking round on hard floors? No. No. OK, have you had, any other medical problems before? Uh, well, I had uh. You know what just, kind of your garden variety stuff, right, colds and, uh. I mean I, I do have, I'm far-sighted, and so I had uh, I had Lasik surgery. And then, once I had this really bad UTI, they thought it was kidney stones, and so they had me actually in ER. And if my GP didn't call them, tell them, that you know, they don't need to give me Morphine. Um, that was kind of an awful experience but, uh, other than that, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty good. OK, and, do you take any other medications, apart from the ones you told me about? Well, I'll take uh, I take vitamin D. Uh, I take melatonin. Sometimes, you know, just for cramps, I'll take, like, uh, um, ibuprofen, or actually , uh, I'll take, what am I taking? Aleve. Whatever Aleve is. Think that's maybe um, Acetaminophen, or, I can't remember what class of drugs. You know occasionally, if I'm really having hard times, like I'll, I'll sleeping, I'll take Xanax. Um, but, I prefer Melatonin, it's just sometimes Melatonin doesn't work. OK. And, any problems with your stomach, or asthma, indigestion, acid reflux? No, no, no problems. . And, what I would suggest is, definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using. So, as much as you can, 'cause that really does make a difference to injuries. Brings the healing blood into the area, and it gives it the best chance of, getting better. So, as much as you can, use the ice. Mm-hmm. Um, obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon programme, but. Um, I would, try and ease up on the running, if you can. And if it, if it's painful enough that you're, having to stop running, then it's not a good idea, to do that. Um. It's fine to take the Ibuprofen. Um, I can prescribe you a slightly stronger, anti-inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the Ibuprofen, but not with the Ibuprofen. Hmm. But make sure that with food. Ultimately we probably need to, examine the knee. I see. Um, so, the best thing I would, suggest, getting a appointment with the physiotherapist first, who can do like a long, assessment, and examination of the knee. And then we can make an assessment as to whether we need to do any, um, imagery to , have a look inside the knee, and see if there's any problem with the, cartilage. OK. Well, you know I read, I read some stuff online that, that maybe like my ligaments there's, I think it's like ACL or, or something like that right, and so if that. I mean I'm kind of like freaked out that that may break. So do you think it's that, or? Um, it's, it's not really possible to, diagnose that over the , over the video. So we definitely would need to, see you. And, the, a physio is the best point of call, because they'll probably be the most likely initial treatment. Right. But certainly if the appointment time's too long to wait, then we can see, we can see you in our clinic as well. OK. OK. Can you, so are you going to send referral for that? Yep, we can, we can do a referral before that. If in the meantime you develop like persistant swelling, heat, redness, um, of the knee, or high temperature, feel unwell, or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it. OK. Great. Then, you'd need to see a doctor urgently, so call us back in that, case. . Mm-hmm. That sounds good. Thank you yeah. , sure I mean, give me the, stronger medicine, I'll give that a try. OK. I'll send it through to your pharmacy for you. OK? Thank you, bye. OK. Sweet. Thanks so much. OK. Bye, bye.",

Uh, but I, I, I feel like, um, I can't, really drink too much, so I feel very dehydrated. OK. When you say you can't drink too much, why is that? Uh, yeah because, really I, uh I, um, I'm like, I feel like I don't drink enough, like I'm, I'm drink, I'm trying to drink, but then I just go to the loo, and I like, I, uh I, I, I do everything and I feel dehydrated again.

Alright. Any headaches or muscle pains? Not, not really, no. OK, alright. And you mentioned three days ago. What were you doing when the symptoms started? Are you aware of any triggers? , not that I, I remember, what was I doing, I, I was at home I was working, on my computer and. Yeah, just felt, like some nausea and I had to, to vomit, and then I had some diarrhoea, straight after that. Yeah. Did you have any takeaway food, or any dodgy restaurant food? Uh, not that I remember, no. OK. Have you been around anyone unwell, with diarrhea recently, last week or so? Hmm, not that I know, not that I. OK. OK. Um, right.

Uh, not really, I drink infrequently, like socially let's say, and I don't smoke. OK, alright. Um fine. uh Robert um having listened to your story, I think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis, uh which essentially is just a, a tummy bug.

Yeah, around five to six times a day. Okay. And can you tell me, I know it's not nice to talk about, but is it quite watery, your stools? Loose? Yes, it's definitely watery, loose stools. Any blood in your stools? No, not that I could see. Okay, and with the diarrhea, have you noticed any other symptoms like tummy pain? Not really, no.

      "reference_text": "Hello? . Good morning, Tim. Um, how can I help you this morning? Um, so I'm Having some, some pain, uh, in my tummy, like the lower part of my tummy. Um and I've just been feeling, quite, hot and sweaty. OK. Right, I'm sorry to hear that. When, when did your symptoms all start? About two days ago. OK. And whereabouts in your tummy is the pain, exactly? Uh, like below my belly button, it's like quite, sore when I press on it. OK. Did the pain come on quite suddenly, or was it more gradual? , it hasn't been, it's more gradual and it's just, it is getting a bit worse now. OK, OK. And can you describe the pain to me? Uh, it's kind of like a, a, I guess a burning pain. Uh, and it's just right there yeah, in that spot, like uh, that's mostly where I'm feeling it. It hasn't spread anywhere else. Just in, just below your belly button you uh, mentioned. Yeah. OK. Um, and is the pain constant, or does it come and go? It's pretty constant, it's like getting worse. Um, it's not like, I , I can still move and walk around. Uh, I mean I'm still kind of functioning, it's just uh, I'm aware of it time. . Mm-hmm. OK. Um, and with the pain have you noticed any other symptoms, at all? So, for example, let's, let's focus first on your bowels. Are your bowels working OK? Yeah, I had a bit of constipation, but that's better, now. That was like, since last week. OK. So you've got no other symptoms, like diarrhea or loose stools? No, I'm , I'm, my bowel movements are normal now. No. OK. And, what about your waterworks? Are you passing urine OK? Yeah, I'm fine, that's fine, that's. I did notice that I was a little, the urine was a little pink, in colour. But I haven't like, it hasn't really been burning, specifically or hurting when I pee and uh. And I did notice I was going to the, I was peeing more, regularly, but I have been drinking lots of fluids. So I wasn't sure, um, I wasn't sure, um, like you know, if that was related to the pain. Mm. And when you mentioned pink urine, do you, was there any blood at all in your urine? Or was it difficult to say? I can't say, I mean maybe. OK, alright. But otherwise, it doesn't hurt, uh, or or or sting, when you pass urine? And I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that. Um, just that I'm, peeing more than , more regularly. OK. OK. Um, OK. And um, moving on to other symptoms, have you noticed any vomiting, or feeling nauseous at all? Just a little nauseous, um, but no vomiting. No vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers? I haven't , I felt a bit hot and sweaty, but I haven't really measured it, so I can't really say. OK, fine. Um, uh, uh, and Kim, have to ask um, uh all all all patients. This this question is about your cycle, if you don't mind me asking. Um, are you currently um, are you currently sexually active? Yes. Uh, yeah I've, I have had the same partner, I am, we were last sexually active about four days ago. Um, my last STD screen was normal, which was about six months ago. OK. So you've had no other partner since then. No, the . OK. Um, uh, and do you use any contraception at all? Uh, I'm, on the Implanon. I had the Implanon inserted about a year ago. At the moment, OK, fine. Um, are you still having periods? Yes. When was your last period? Uh, my last period was about, three weeks ago. I mean, two weeks ago. Two week scare, OK. So, is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implement in there, but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? It's something for us to think about Well, we don't use any other barrier, method so, we just use the , I just have the Implanon and the same partner. Um. Theoretically, if the Implanon, hasn't been working then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect . Yeah, OK. Well it's something for us to think about. Um, uh, maybe worth taking a pregnancy test later on, just to confirm that. Um OK. And, and so, just to summarize so far, if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple of days, it's tummy pain that's really affected you, mainly lower down towards your belly button. It's quite burning, you said. It's getting worse. Um, you noticed some pink urine. Um, but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine. Your bowels are working OK. You've felt a little bit nauseous, um, and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right? Yeah, that sounds, very accurate. Is there anything else, perhaps, that you feel like you should share with me at this stage, anything that might be important? I don't think so, I think I've, you , we've covered everything that's really bothering me. Yeah, OK. Um, tell me, tell me a bit more about your um, medical history otherwise. Are you normally fit and well? Yeah, , well, I haven't had any, surgical, I don't have any surgical history. I don't have any previous, I haven't had any operations before, or, and I'm not on any other medication, I just have the Implanon. OK. Um, have you had anything like this before in the past? Any similar symptoms? I've never , I've never had these symptoms before. No, OK. Um Fine. Um, any other family history I should be aware of? Anything relevant, family, uh related to bowels, maybe related to history? No, not that , not that I'm aware of, no. OK. Alright. Um, and socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? Uh, I live in a share house, and with two other, two other room-mates. OK. Um, and uh, are you currently working? Yeah, I currently, I am currently . What do you do for work? I am an accountant. OK. Um OK. Um, Do you smoke at all, Kim? No. No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Uh , socially I drink, but uh, I don't think more, more than normal. . No, OK. OK. Um, just before I go to the examination, I just want to go through just some few screening questions if that's OK, yes or no. Uh, we've, we've covered the majority of them already. Uh, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else. All right. Um, how's your, how's your chest? How's your breathing? Um, any I don't feel short of breath uh, or, I'm not having any problems, or I don't have a cough or anything that's , worrying me. OK. Any uh, funny heartbeats or rhythms, palpitations? Not that it, no. OK. Any headaches? Any problems with your vision? No. No, OK. Alright. Um, Fine, OK. Um, So really just uh, moving on, um, And so based, based on your story really, uh, uh Kim it's, it's it's difficult. it's it's um, you know you've got some tummy pain. You don't exactly know what's causing it. It could be a few different things that could be causing your pain. Could just be a, you know, could just be a urine infection, for example. Could just be something related to your gut. Um, could just be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy-related cause. Um, and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially. to try and rule out um, what's going on here. Um, which I can organize for you today. OK. Um, and basically those tests, we, we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed. But certainly, it if it's been going on for the last couple of days, um, Uh, you know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for a maybe urine infection. And, so it's an . Yeah, I , can we do that instead of me, going for tests, and then seeing how that goes? Yeah, absolutely. So, um I think it's certainly worth, you know covering you with some antibiotics today. Uh, but i still want you to bear in mind, you know, have a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here. And, um, and I want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time, if your symptoms are not getting any better, or indeed if they're getting worse. So, things to look out for would be, you know, worsening tummy pain, um, if you're feeling really hot or sweaty, your temperature's not coming down um, vomiting et cetera. Does that make sense? Yeah, I think I'm happy with that plan. OK. Um, you can try just regular painkillers, uh, Paracetamol would be advisable. Um, make sure you drink plenty of fluids. You can try some cranberry juice as well, which uh, can sometimes help with your urine symptoms. Um, take the antibiotics, uh, and give me a call, you know, if you are worried about anything else. Uh, sure. That sounds great. Thank you very much. Um, should I just collect the script at my pharmacy? Yeah, if I send it straight to your pharmacy, start the antibiotics today, something called Trimethoprim. Um, you can take two tablets, uh, one tablet twice a day for three days. OK. OK, , that sounds great. Uh, , let's see how you get on. OK. Thank you very much. Great. All the best! Bye. Bye bye.",

Are you in a quiet and private space to talk? I am, yes. Good, and can I confirm your name and date of birth please? Uh, it's Joe Bloggs. It's the seventh, of June, nineteen seventy four. Seventy four, and how old does that make you? Sorry, fifty four . I'm, suppose I'd be fifty three, well, yeah. Perfect. Great, and it says here, um, it says you're having chest discomfort. Is that correct? That, that is correct, yes. I'm experiencing discomfort in my chest. OK, can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort? When it started, and how you're feeling at the moment? Sure, um, it's been ongoing for, a couple of hours now. Um, I'd say that it's come on, quite suddenly. I was, digging in the garden. And it, if I had to describe where it is, it's somewhere in the middle of my chest. And it's more, it feels like it's pressure, discomfort, than more, than a pain. Um, if I, had to . If I, if I had to describe what discomfort feeling, it's, it's like someone's sitting on my chest. . OK. And. Yeah. Great. So, you've talked about your chest. Are you still in, discomfort at the moment? Uh, yes I do smoke, yeah. OK, and when it started, how would you rate it out, out of ten? Say about, say, seven out of ten. OK, . Ten being, very sort of, unbearable and severe pain. Seven is. Quite manageable, well, it's quite . OK, and how about now? Um, it's still the same. OK, and tell me before this happened, what were you doing? Yeah. Um, I was, relaxing. My wife, and, we're watching Jeremy Kyle. OK. still go out into the garden. OK, and how often do you do gardening? Um, every other week. So, fortnightly. OK, and are you normally fit and well? So, are you normally OK to garden as you would? Uh, yes. Great, and apart from this, do you have any other medical problems? Um, high cholesterol, and, I've had hypertension, hypertension. OK, so that's high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Do you take any medicines for that? No, I don't take any medicine. OK, and are you allergic to anything? Uh, . OK. So, let me summarise what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago, and you experienced chest discomfort, which was roughly seven out of ten. And it feels more like someone's sitting on your chest, as opposed to pain. Yeah. Yes, that's great. And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual, specifically with your breathing? Uh, yes I have. Um, I've got shortness of breath. And I feel slightly, light-headed. OK, and is that getting worse or better? Um, it's remained the same. Although, I would say recently I've noticed, in terms of sort of breathing, I've had, some difficulty climbing the stairs. And, if I have to sort of walk uphill, there's that sort of challenge as well. And when you get short of breath, when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain? Um, no pain as such, but there's often calf pain and, leg swellings. OK. So, let me confirm. You have the pressure at the moment, and you have shortness of breath, is that correct? That is correct, yes. . So, given what you've told me about your past medical history. I think it might be worth, you calling an ambulance. OK. get you to the hospital as soon as possible. Because, my concern is, it might be something to do with your heart. So, While to you, I will ring an ambulance. Who, should come to your address. Ohh, OK. Ohh right. But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone. So I can gather some more information, that we can give to the paramedics. Is that OK? OK. Um, should I, be concerned about anything? It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but, given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and you've got some chest pain. I'm always worried about the heart first, before anything else. , OK, . , and we, and we need to look after your heart before anything else. So, apart from this light-headedness, and this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else unusual? Um, nothing, else unusual. Um, I'm not sure if I spoke to you about nausea? I've noticed nausea, but no vomiting, yet. Did you have anything to eat or drink this morning? Um, no. And you feel, still feel nauseous at the moment? I have, yeah. I am, yeah. So, I have a couple of other questions to ask you, and I'm gonna reel them off. So, apologies for not letting you talk very much. OK. No, that's fine. Have you noticed this pressure, radiating to your head? Uh, not to my head, no. And how about to your left, or right arm? Uh, yes. There is some pain in my left shoulder and arm. And does that pain go anywhere else? To your left arm, or to your back? Uh, no. And, have you noticed any problems swallowing, or drinking water? Uh, no. Good. And have you noticed any problems going to the loo? Uh, no problems going to the loo. And you're normally fit and well, apart from the two things you told me about? Um. Yes, however, there's some problems just, performing daily activities. Um, like I said, with the difficulties climbing up the stairs and going uphill. Um, I try to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house, nothing too strenuous. And, do you live at home with your wife at the moment? Uh, yes. OK. I would suggest, if she's there, you let her know that, you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today. So, she might need to get your things together. OK. Got it, OK. The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm, and have some water if you need to. OK. Don't take any of those medications. Right. OK. And the paramedics should be with you, very shortly. All right. So, when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about. OK. The one is your chest, so, your heart. And the second is your breathing, which is your lungs. Yes. OK. So, they will give you lots of things to breathe through, and attach things to your arms. Just to check, things like your blood pressure, and your heart rate. So, don't be worried. OK. And, when you get to the hospital, you'll be seen by a consultant, pretty, pretty much immediately. Yeah, . Reassuring, I'm getting . Sure. So, I will let the paramedics do their job. And when, you're at the hospital, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes, to let me know how everything's going. Ohh, that's great. Great. I'll um, book another appointment, to see you soon. Uh, , once you've had your adventure. OK. That is perfect. Thank you so much. No problems. Do you have any questions for me? Uh, no questions.

      "hypothesis_text": "Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Yeah, I can. Can you hear me? I can. Hi, my name is Dr Gohill. I'm one of the physicians that works at Babylon. Are you in a quiet and private space to talk? I am, yes. Good. And can I confirm your name and date of birth please? It's Joe Bluggs. It's the seventh of june nineteen seventy four. seventy four. And how old does that make you? Sorry, fifty four. Perfect. I'm supposed to be fifty three. Great. And it says here, it says you're having chest discomfort. Is that correct? That is correct, yes. I'm experiencing some discomfort in my chest. Can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort when it started and how you're feeling at the moment? Sure, it's been ongoing for a couple of hours now. I'll say that this quite suddenly, I was digging in the garden and if I had to describe where it is, it's somewhere in the middle of my chest and it feels more like a pressure, the discomfort than more than a pain. If I had to describe what that discomfort feeling is like someone sitting on my chest. Okay. Yeah, great. So you've talked about your chest. Are you still in discomfort at the moment? Yes, as you said. Okay, and when it started, how would you rate it out of ten? Okay, about seven out of ten. Okay. Ten being in very sort of unbearable and severe pain. Seven is quite manageable. It's quite uncomfortable. Okay, and how about now? It's still the same. Okay, and tell me before this happened, what were you doing? I was relaxing with my wife and we're watching Jeremy Kyle. Okay. So go after the garden. Okay, and how often do you do gardening? Every other week, so fortnightly. Okay, and are you normally fit and well so are you normally okay to garden as you would? Yes. Great and apart from this do you have any other medical problems? High cholesterol and have had hypertension, not have hypertension. Okay so that's high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Do you take any medicines for that? No, I don't take any medicine. Okay, and are you allergic to anything? As three. Okay, so let me summarize what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago and you experienced chest discomfort, which was roughly seven out of ten. Yeah. It feels more like someone sitting on your chest as opposed to pain. Yes, that's good. And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual specifically with your breathing? Yes, I have. I've got shortness of breath. I feel slightly lightheaded. Okay, and is that getting worse or better? It's remained the same, although I'll say recently I've noticed in terms of sort of breathing I've had some difficulty climbing stairs and if I have to sort of walk uphill, there's that sort of challenge as well. And when you get short of breath when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain? No pain as such, but there's often calf pain and leg swelling. Okay, so let me confirm you have the pressure at the moment and you have shortness of breath, is that correct? That is correct, yes. So given what you've told me about your past medical history, I think it might be worth you calling an ambulance to get you to the hospital as soon as possible because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart. So while we talk to you I will ring an ambulance who should come to your address. Right. But in the meantime I think we should stay on the phone so I can gather some more information that we can give to the paramedics. Is that okay? Should I be concerned about anything? It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol and you've got some chest pain, I'm always worried about the heart first before anything else. Again, make no mistake. And we need to look after your heart before anything else. So apart from this lightheadedness and this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else unusual? Nothing else unusual. I'm not sure if I talked to you about nausea. I've noticed some nausea but no vomiting. Do you have anything to eat or drink this morning? No. And you feel still feel nauseous at the moment? I have, yeah. I am, yeah. So I have a couple of other questions to ask you and I'm going to reel them off. So apologies for not letting you talk very much. No, that's fine. Have you noticed this pressure radiating to your head? No, to my head, no. And how about to your left or right arm? Yes, there is some pain in my left shoulder right now. And does that pain go anywhere else, to your left arm or to your back? No. And have you noticed any problems swallowing or drinking water? No. Good. And have you noticed any problems going to the loo? No problems going to the loo. And you're normally fit and well apart from the two things you told me about? Yes. However, there are some problems just performing daily activities. Like I said, with the difficulties climbing upstairs and going uphill, I try to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house, nothing to stress. And do you live at home with your wife at the moment? Yes. Okay. I would suggest if she's there you let her know that you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today, so she might need to get your things together. The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm and have some water if you need to. Don't take any of those medications. The paramedics should be with you very shortly. So when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about. The one is your chest, so your heart. And the second is your breathing, which is your lungs. Okay. So they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms, just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate. So don't be worried. Okay. And when you get to the hospital, you'll be seen by a consultant pretty much immediately. Yeah. Right. Reassuring confidence that. Sure. So I will let the paramedics do their job and when you're at the hospital the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how everything's going. Oh that's great. Great. I'll book another appointment to see you soon in the clinic once you've had your adventure. That's perfect. Thank you so much. No problems. Do you have any questions for me? No questions. I'll just await the ambulance. Great. Thank you very much. No problems. I'll speak to you soon. Thank you so much. Bye. Okay."
