My name's Lizzy Irvine. twenty third of july nineteen ninety five. Great. Thank you, Lizzy. And are you in a confidential and comfortable space to talk? Yeah, especially on a Friday. Great. How can I help? Yeah, just for the last couple of days, I've been feeling really sick in my lower tummy. And I've had a bit of a temperature, so feeling quite like hot and sweaty. And it's yagging, and really uncomfortable. Okay, so you've been feeling nauseous and you've had some pain in your lower tummy or you say you've been feeling sick in your lower tummy? Yeah, it's more of an ache, so like an ache in my lower tummy. Okay. And then I think it's feeling hot and sweaty sometimes think it's sickness, but yeah, a bit of an ache. Okay, so feeling hot, sweaty, unwell for three days, feeling sick, nausea, with an ache in your low tummy. Any actual vomiting? So yeah, no, just nauseous, no vomiting yet, luckily. And it's only been for a couple of days, but yeah. Two days, yeah. Okay. And any problems with your waterworks or diarrhea? No, so I'm I'm going to the loo a little bit more often than usual. I drink lots of water, but it does feel like more often. Yeah, like nothing, nothing too out of the ordinary. And I was a little bit like, I don't know, constipated, I guess. About a week ago, but I'm AK now. Okay, so you've been constipated a week ago. Things are You're having regular bowel motions now? You said you had a bit of diarrhea, a bit of watery, did you say? No, it was more like I was just a little bit bummed up and then about a week ago that kind of cleared and I'm normal now. Okay, and you're going you're drinking lots of water, you're going to the toilet more frequently for a week? Is that? Yes, yeah I'd say so. I tend to drink a lot of water anyway but I feel like I'm going to the toilet more. Any pain when you pass urine? No, no pain. No stinging? No, just seems normal, yeah. Okay. And sort of no foul smelling urine or anything like that. No, nothing I can think of. No. Are you having you're saying you're going a bit more frequently? Are you having to go with urgency to the toilet for a week? No, there's no urgency. Yeah, no pain or urgency. Just peeing quite frequently, but it's all seeming normal. Yeah, I probably wouldn't have thought of it being linked, but yeah. Okay. All right, so the main symptom is feeling sick with this, you've been feeling bunged up and this sort of pain in your tummy. Just to ask a few more questions about the pain in your tummy, how would you describe the pain? Yeah, it's like below my belly button. It's aching. It does make me feel nauseous. Yeah, so it's kind of more like a, I guess like a dull ache just below the belly button, kind of, yeah, here. And is it constant or is it coming and going? Yeah, it's feeling pretty constant over the last couple of days. And just need to ask a few questions about your periods and stuff. Any chance you could be pregnant at the moment? Ooh, I don't know. Probably not. I don't think so. I'm very careful. Sexually active at the moment? Yes, yeah. And you mentioned periods. I did notice a bit of I don't know, it's like not necessarily like spotting, but in my my P is like a little I suppose I think I thought it was my period. It's like a little bit pink. In your P did you say your P is slightly red. Or slightly pink? Yeah. But I am kind of like due on my I didn't know if that was yeah, part of it. Okay, so when was your last menstrual period? Around a month ago, yeah, three and a three and a bit weeks ago. Okay, so three and a half. And did you say, so you're sexually active, are you using contraception? I've got the arm, the implants. And one sexual partner, a regular boyfriend? Yeah. So just to go back to your symptom of constipation, can I just clarify when was the last time you had a bowel motion? Yesterday. Okay, and do you feel like you are still quite bunged up at the moment? No, it seems to have cleared up. So I was about a week ago, but I'm okay, okay now, the last few days. Yeah, it's been okay. Okay. All right, so you just to sort of confirm your symptoms, you're feeling sort of sick, nauseous, with tummy pain, which is fairly constant. Did the tummy pain come on suddenly or gradually? It's only been for the last two days. So I guess, yeah, quite recently. So it's come on gradually, has it? Yeah. Not sudden onset. Okay. And your last menstrual period was just three and a bit weeks ago. But you say you've had some a little bit of spotting possibly before in between periods or recently? Yeah, the last kind of week or so. Yeah, the last couple of days really. But because I was due on, yeah, I think, yeah, just the last couple of days. OK. But you're expecting your period soon? Yes, yeah. Sure. OK. And just to ask a few questions, do you have any other medical problems that I need to be aware of? I don't. I'm allergic to amoxicillin. Allergic to amoxicillin, but no other medical problems that you? No, not that I'm aware of. Any drug allergies? Oh, you mentioned amoxicillin, but anything else? No, that's it. And do you take any medications at the moment? No medications, but I'm on the implants, I think it's called implanon. Implanon, yeah, sure. Okay. Do you smoke? No. Okay, and do you live alone with your partner? With my boyfriend. With your boyfriend. And any other medical, sorry, any diseases running your family? Not any that's bringing to mind in my immediate family. My brother is a type one diabetic. Sure. Okay, great. So is there anything that you're particularly concerned about with this sort of nausea and the constipation? I don't know. It's just a really like a really horrible ache and I'm nauseous, hot, sweaty feeling. I'm not really sure why it's happening. The last couple of days, that's probably all that's getting comfortable. Yeah. Anything that you'd hoped particularly to get out of having this consultation? Anything. Sorry. Was there anything that you'd hoped to get out of having this specific consultation other than a diagnosis and getting better and being on the right track to feeling better? Yeah, no, that's kind of I just want to go back to normal. Yes. A bit more comfortably. Yeah, sure, sure. Okay, so and then finally I didn't ask you, do you have any discharge or anything like that from down below? No, no, no discharge. No discharge. Okay. All right. So I think this could be a few different things. It could just be simple constipation. You mentioned that you were bunged up, but you did go yesterday. So it's and your bowel habits that you've been going regularly, but you did mention that you were bunged up. But there could be a few other things going on. I would quite like to see you to do some further, to do an examination and to do some tests as well. We need to definitely rule out pregnancy with you and possibly do some other examinations or further tests. So would you be happy to actually see a GP face to face soon today, ideally? Yes, yeah. Yeah. So I can make time. And you're feeling hot and sweaty? Have you been feeling lightheaded at all or like you're going to faint? No, no, not like I'm going to faint. Okay. All right. Well, we're just sort of tying up running out of time a little bit, but I'd really like to see you for some more examination and investigations. If in the meantime, between now and me or AGP seeing you, you feel worse in any way, you get lightheaded, you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you, then I think take them quite seriously and see somebody more urgently if possible. Okay, is that was there anything else that you want to talk about right now? I'm glad we've got the ball rolling with this and we can sort of see you again to take this a little bit further. Okay? Yeah, thank you. Really appreciate that. Okay. All right, thanks for your time.
