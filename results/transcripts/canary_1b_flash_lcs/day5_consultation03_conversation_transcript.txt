Hi there, I'm Dr Smith from Babylon. Hi. Hi there, can you just confirm your name, date of birth, and the first line of your address first of all please? Yeah, my name is Valerie Hall. My date of birth is the nineteenth of september nineteen ninety three. My address is sixty four Cliveden Place in South Wimbledon. Okay, are you in a private place where you can have a confidential consultation today? Yes, I am. What can I do for you? I've been feeling really anxious over the past few months. I just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house and it started to really worry me and just add up and build up on that anxiety and I just didn't know who to talk to so I wanted to check with my GP. Okay, do you mind just telling me a bit more about when it started? Do you think there's something which changed in your life that time? I guess so. I think I would say maybe about two months or so I've been feeling like this and that probably coincides with me starting a new job. Which I would say it's quite I mean every job is stressful when you first start, but it's been really stressful I think over the past two months, definitely. What's your job? So I work for a fashion retailer in the head office team and it's just a brand new sector. I've never worked in retail before. My boss is not very nice to me. But I also think that it's just been I just really dread going there. I just hate speaking to her. I hate seeing everyone and really worried about whether I'm doing well or not. And it's really impacting on the rest of my life, my sleep and stuff like that. Okay. So just day to day, tell me from the start of your day how it affects you. You dread going to work. How does it affect you in terms of your sleep at night and things like that? Yes, absolutely. So as I say, I don't want to go to work in the morning, so I just find no way of I can't get out of bed. But it's also because when I leave, when I've left work, I just feel so stressed and so worried about everything I've done. I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours. Okay, so what time do you go to bed at nighttime? About ten, eleven. And what time do you get to sleep? Not for ages. I'm lying awake all night. Okay, and when you eventually get to sleep, do you wake up with your alarm in the morning or does something else wake you up before then? So I find my heart kind of racing and then I'm just like panicking that I'm going to be late and that that's going to make work even more stressful. So I do have an alarm but I find myself waking up before that because I'm just my heart is racing and actually the other day I was just like I was lying in bed and I really thought my heart was racing so much I thought I was going to have a heart attack in the morning. Okay and so how many hours of sleep do you think you get a night? I just I can't even tell because I feel like I'm even when I'm in sleep it's such a shallow sleep but maybe three, four hours I'm getting now. Okay. And what about your eating patterns? Any change in how you're eating or whether your appetite's changed? Probably not significant changes. Maybe no, I wouldn't say that I'm eating much differently. Although I probably have more chocolate than normal just because I feel so down. Okay. You're eating regularly otherwise. Yeah. And you told me about the palpitations. Just tell me a bit more about that. Yeah. So it's usually kind of like when I realize in the morning that either I feel like I'm going to be late because I've overslept because I'm so tired or I wake up in a panic thinking I am going to be late. So it's just kind of like just a constant like rapid heartbeating. It's really stressful. I don't know if it's stress or if I did think it was like a heart problem initially. Is it for like a regular fast beat or an irregular beat? Irregular I think. And how long do you think it lasts for when you get it? Oh it can be anything. I think it was like a couple of minutes or the other day I was actually just sort of lying there for like holding my hand on my chest for like ten minutes. Okay. Is that something that you've had before this or is that a new thing? Yeah, I would say this is only in the past sort of like couple of months as I say that I've been experiencing this. Okay, any chest pain with that? No. Well yeah, it's painful to when the heart when my heart is beating fast but yeah. And in the daytime, how you said you're not getting much sleep, so how's your energy level in the daytime? It's just really, really low. I'm finding now that I'm just I find no enjoyment at all kind of day to day in anything that I'm doing. It's not just my job, it's you know, when I leave, I'm just so tired that anything that previously was really fun is just not enjoyable and I'm like yeah, on edge the whole time. Okay, so what do you do in the evenings? Well, right now I'm working so late because everything is really, really stressful so I don't really get much time for myself but when I do want to go out or see friends or just relax it seems quite difficult to do that. Okay, and are you avoiding contact with friends or do you still see them? I avoid them in so much that I feel like I'm Yeah, so I mean, sometimes it just I know that I'm not going to have fun because I don't want to go out and do things that I would normally have done. Okay, what about hobbies or exercise or anything else outside work? Do you do anything else outside work? Yeah, as I say, everything that I had previously been doing has been just difficult to continue with. I did used to like go running and to play tennis and stuff, but now it's just not, I'm just not enjoying it. I'm not, I'm not like, I'm not going out to do that quite so much. And has it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work? No, because I think that would just add to the tension, but I do pretty much every morning I think, oh, I should call him sick or like, Okay. not go. And what's the worst that it's got? Have you ever been so overwhelmed that you couldn't get into the office, you couldn't go into a situation? You ever had a panic attack? No, I wouldn't say so. I think I've always managed to make it to work, but I wonder if it's building up. So this is why I want to hog, so I'm worried it's building up to that. I don't know what to do because I've felt it get worse and worse over the past. Okay, and apart from work, are there any other situations which provoke quite extreme anxiety, like being in public places, social situations, public transport, anything like that? Yeah, I mean, I find public transport really stressful in a way, especially being on the tube because it's quite getting warmer, so it's just really airless. But I think the majority of it, because my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well. Okay, before this, did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this? Not really. No, I would say, I mean, everybody always has a bit of tension, a bit of anxiety, but I've never felt anything that's bad before. Okay, and what about your mood day to day? I mean I can see that you're quite distressed by it, but do you ever get really down about this? I mean, yeah, yeah, because I do, yeah, I'm pretty much down, like I don't enjoy being with my day at all because I'm just so worried about everything and I find that even when I'm not like even at the weekends and stuff it's just the kind of like constant feeling of just being a bit down a bit unhappy. When do you think you last felt yourself? I don't know if that's a good question. I can't really I can't really put a date on that at all. And has your mood ever been so low that you felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job or with your life or with your normal things as they were going on? I wouldn't say that I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any thoughts that have been that extreme. I have a good support system. I do have a good family and stuff. I don't have worries about actually wanting to not go on. It's just that I don't want to go on like this. Yeah, okay. And who do you live with at home? Sorry. Who do you live with at home? Yeah, I live with my parents, just my parents. And how much alcohol do you have in an average week, do you think? I don't know. Probably quite a lot on the Friday or Saturday just because that's kind of normal. Maybe I do have a bit during the week that my parents obviously are retired so they just drink whenever they want. So whenever they're having a glass of wine they'll offer it to me and I guess I don't really keep track of it that much. Okay, so how much would you guess? Probably quite a lot on Friday or Saturday because it's usually going out so maybe like I probably go over my limit just on those days anyway and then like maybe a glass of wine during the week. Okay. Do you smoke or take any other drugs or anything? I try not to smoke but I do occasionally but I don't take it. Okay. And have you done anything yourself to help? Have you talked to anyone, talked to any counselors, done any online, looked online at all? Any way so? I talked to my mom because she also suffers from or she's suffered from like depression in the past. I didn't think that it was that I was suffering from actual depression because it just seems to be manifesting as total stress the whole time. But I did talk to my mom about it. I haven't sought any. She recommended that I come to the GP, but I haven't sought any other. And would you be happy to have some one to one therapy? Yeah, I think so. I've never done that before, but yeah. Okay. What we would suggest in the first instance is to self refer via the NHS for what we call talking therapy, which is a type of thing to behavioral therapy where they can really look at your situation, how you're reacting to the what's provoking the anxiety and what you can do to try and overcome that. So I can send you the link for that. In the meantime, it can be a bit of a wait. There are some online resources that are really helpful. Put the details on there and you can get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well. And if you're feeling like it's not helping at all or your anxiety is getting worse to the point where you can't cope with work or you can't just do your normal things day to day, then it's important for you to give us a call back and just discuss that further. I mean, some people with anxiety, they do need to take medication to control that but that's not something that we've suggested in the first instance. Okay and I'll put some more information on your notes about helping with your sleep patterns and things like that. That's great. I look forward to reading it. In terms of the palpitations it is worth it to be associated with anxiety but it's probably worth having a couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that there's not something triggering that off and then arranging a GP follow up a week after you've had the test so we can just go through the results with you. Okay, okay. So if you call the support line you can arrange the have the blood test done. Okay, I'll call them up. Okay. Thank you so much. All right, take care. Have a good day. Bye. Sorry, talk right over.
