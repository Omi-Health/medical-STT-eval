Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Hi, I can hear you. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Hi, I'm doctor Jacob and welcome to Babylon. How are you doing? Hello, I'm Peter. I'm doing okay, I guess. Okay, Peter. So just before we start, is it alright if you could confirm your full name for me, please? That's Peter Peterson. Okay, and your date of birth? I'm thirty five years old. That's going to be difficult now. Fine. And what's your email address? My email address is peter dot peterson at lawyers dot co dot UK dot That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. I am. That's right. Thank you very much. All right. So you've mentioned that you are not having much of an appetite and energy lately. I'm sorry to hear that. Could you tell me a bit more about it, please? That's right. Started long, long ago now that I've been feeling down and I didn't really have energy. My wife was starting to complain as well in nightly activities. I just felt like I needed to call you guys and needed to get some more information about what could be going on. It's just that, yeah, nothing is like feeling right. I feel out of place and it's just down. So are you telling me that your mood's low? Is that what you're trying to tell me? Yes, I feel like I'm feeling short of breath. It's like always, yeah, out of energy, I would say. Yes, the energy. So what's your mood? Would you say you're depressed? You never want to say that, do you? It's a tough one, isn't it? Because you don't want to actually say I mean, work is okay. I have trouble at work sometimes, having headaches, feeling nauseous, but I can do my work. That's okay. Do you like your work? Again. Do you like your work? Who likes to be a lawyer? Sorry, that was me. Yes, of course. I like it. You like your work, okay. And how are things at home? All right? Are you having any kind of stress at all? It is okay. Sometimes because I'm having a loss of appetite, I'm not eating very much and I have complaints. Other than that, it's okay. And have you lost any weight? I have a little bit. Yes. But that's over a long period now. Okay, right. So you mentioned that you've lost your appetite for a while now. So how long are we talking about? That must have started when I changed over to the new law firm. I would say months ago. We're talking about two months, three months or six months, if you could open up three months ago, three and a half months ago. Three and a half months ago. But you said your weight loss is much longer than that? Yeah, it started earlier than that. Sorry, could you I couldn't hear you. What did you say, your weight loss, how long? It started a little bit earlier than that. I'm not sure though how it is connected. Roughly six months, would you say? Something like that, yeah. Six months. And roughly how much have you lost? Just approximately. Oh gosh, I would say less than a stone, something like that. So about a stone, yeah? Six months, okay, okay, six kilos. Okay, right, okay, so just a few more questions. It might seem a bit awkward, but it's quite relevant. Okay, so how are your bowels? Are they okay? I feel nauseous every now and again. It's coming up, yeah, just every now and again, not feeling very good, trying to eat something but don't really want to. Yeah, your bowels, how's your toilet? That's okay, I would say. I don't really have problems when going to the toilet. It's to spend less. So you're not going to the toilet? Yes, yes. You are going. Like, to be very more specific, you don't have any diarrhea? No, no diarrhea, no palpitation. Okay. So there's no blood in the poo, no mucus, nothing of that sort? No. No. You mentioned nausea. Have you been ever sick with it? No, actually not. So that's Yeah, I'm feeling unwell in the bowel region, yeah. Oh, just the nausea. Okay. Is there any particular foods that make you nauseous? No, nothing. Okay, so you can't think of any meal. Do you suffer from acid reflux? I do not. No. Okay. Okay. You've also mentioned that you're feeling short of breath. So just yeah, is there any cough? No, not really, just shortness of breath. Okay. It's like when I go into the lift, it happens to be that, like, you know, my heart starts beating and I can't really breathe. Is it like in closed spaces? No, it happens every time. It happens very significantly in the lift or when I'm when I'm So how far can you walk and when you start feeling short of breath? So how far can you walk with no shortness of breath? Walk or run. Walk. We'll start with walk. Do you feel short of let's start this way. Do you feel short of breath when you walk at all? No, actually not. So you can walk about a mile and you don't feel short of breath at all. That's right, yes. Okay, so just explain a bit more, just to make myself clear about the lift thing. So you said you're short of breath when you're in the lift. Yeah, my heart starts beating, I feel like I can't breathe and it's very difficult to explain. It's going, just that you, you know, when you just feel unwell and yeah, your heart's describing like palpitations to me, yeah? So that's what you're feeling your own heartbeat. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Do you get any chest pains with it? Not really, no. It's just, yeah. Okay, no chest pain. No chest pain. Okay, all right. Fine. So what we need to do just before that, just a few more things. Any past medical history you'd like to share with me today? Yes, I had too little activity of my thyroid. Sorry, you had thyroid problems. Thyroid, too little activity, yes. Oh yeah, under active thyroid, yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And in suit of that, I took thyroxine. Yeah, you're taking thyroxine. Are you using it every day? Not anymore. Why is that? I have not been taking it in the last actually since I changed law form, I would say. Okay, so is that so all these things are since you stopped taking the thyroxine? Oh, that might be coinciding. I'm not sure about that. When was your last blood test? I haven't taken one in a long time. Okay, so you've not had a blood test. Right. Okay. It could you know generally for you know under active thyroids, what symptoms you've said, it's the opposite that usually happens, yeah? It's for overactive thyroid, like you can feel a bit like the racing of your heartbeat and all, so I'm not quite clear what picture we are having here, yeah? I think a general set of bloods is a good idea, good start. So what we look at because you're not having the ump, aren't you? You're just feeling a bit low and things like that, right? Yes. And weak and things like that. So we'll just do a general set of bloods where we look at things like anemia, how your kidney functions are, your livers, all that with vitamin levels and your urine. Okay. Now after we get those set of bloods, we will find out if we can find anything in them. If that's all clear, then we would need to do a physical examination. Okay? We would need to then go in and do the thing. But there's nothing from what you history said that we urgently warrant a physical examination at this point in time. I think it's a good idea to start off with the blood test and then take it from there. Obviously with palpitations or chest pain, if you get that's more of a medical emergency, you need to go to A and E for that. Okay, if things change, you've mentioned now your bowels are fine and you're not being sick. So if that's the case, it's okay, but if your bowels change or you're being sick, again, you need to get in touch with us. Okay, I haven't been walking lately. Sorry. Could you repeat that? Yes, I haven't been walking lately at all. So it's like really hard for me to identify when I feel the shortness of breath. I just wanted to add that into because I haven't been walking. I haven't been feeling good enough or good at all. So let's do all the blood tests first and we'll take it from there. Okay, but you know, if you have any chest pain or change in bowel habits, do get in touch with us. I will. Yes. Now what we need to do is now you need to ring up support and I'll do the form for you but in the interim you need to call support so that we can organize that blood test for you. And once you get the result you will receive a text message through your phone to tell you to book an appointment. Okay. If you're feeling poorly don't wait for that. Just get in touch with us again. Yeah. I will. How do I call support? Oh there's the number on your app. Yeah. If you open up your app, there's the number on there. It's an old three hundred number. Yeah. So just call that number. I will find it. Thank you. All right, then. You take care. Bye now. Thank you. Ciao. Ciao. Bye.
