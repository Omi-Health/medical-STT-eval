Hello? Hello? Hello? Hi, can you hear me? I can hear you, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you now. Excellent. Just before I go any further, can you confirm your name and your age please? Oh yeah, my name is Jessica Smith and I'm 19 years old. Okay, and how can I help you Mrs Smith? Um yeah, so uh I mean this is this is a bit embarrassing but it's kind of uh hurting when I when I use the bathroom when I pee and um it's been going on for a few days so I'm a little bit worried about it. I'm not sure what to do. Right, well thank you for coming in so hopefully we can help with your symptoms. As you mentioned it started a few days ago, so can you tell me a bit more about that what kind of pain it is that you're experiencing? Um it's it's not too bad it's sort of like a stinging kind of pain. It's not like unbearable but uh it's it's definitely uh it definitely bothers me when I pee um and uh yeah I also maybe sometimes get some like pain kind of lowered down in my tummy when I when I go to the bathroom. Okay, yeah. And and uh the pain in your tummy is it can describe the the pain to me? Is it cramping, burning, sharp? Um yeah, I don't know maybe uh sort of sort of cramping. I'm not really sure but it's not like it's not like cramping like when I get when I have a period or something. It's like I don't know. Okay, okay um fine and have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal? Um not I don't think so I haven't noticed it. No, okay fine. Have you noticed any any funny color for your urine? So has there been uh any blood in your urine? Have you noticed any other darkening of your urine? Um there was a little bit of blood earlier today um but besides that not at all no um it does kind of it kind of like doesn't smell very it smells a bit weird I guess um but no not really anything uh anything drastic. Okay fine okay um right let me just write a few notes down as well um fine and you mentioned the tummy pain that also started a few days ago does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards the back or towards your flank or sides? No not really no. No okay fine. Would there symptoms have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Uh no not not at all. Okay any fevers or temperatures? Sorry, sorry I didn't hear you. No no no fever. No fever okay fine. Sorry um okay um in terms of your bowel are your bowels making okay? Um I think so yeah. Any any diarrhea, loose stool? Uh no not that I not that I've noticed at all. Okay all right. And um Jessica sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions uh just to go get full history. Um hoping that mommy asks are you currently sexually active? Uh yeah I am. Okay is that with a regular partner? Um yeah so I've had a boyfriend for about a couple months now yeah. Fine okay um have you noticed any other discharge from from down below? I haven't noticed anything. No okay when was your last um last STD screen? If ever. Uh uh don't think I've ever had one. Okay fine um and um do you use any form of contraception at all? Uh yeah we use condoms. Use condoms okay. When was your last period? A couple weeks ago. Let me get scared. Is there any chance you could be pregnant perhaps? Say again? Is there any chance you could be pregnant? Uh I don't think so. It's always worth asking uh young females like yourself uh uh yeah um so if that obviously if you are worried about the pain um not getting any better then I would always advise you doing a pregnancy test to rule that pregnancy. Okay um fine. So just moving on moving on are you otherwise fitting well? Um yeah I think I'm feeling okay otherwise yeah. And so by that I mean do you have any other medical problems? Medical history? Um so in the past I've had some uh some IBS um but other than that I think no like uh serious medical problems that seem yeah. Okay do you take any regular medications? Uh no I did uh I did a a little bit ago or a couple days ago try some uh over-the-counter bicarbonate to try and help with the pain but it wasn't it wasn't really helping. Okay so you've tried that and didn't help okay all right um do you have any allergies any medications? Oh yeah I'm allergic to clindamycin. And what happens when you take clindamycin? Um I get some like a swelling basically. Okay it seems like quite severe allergy to it is that right? Um okay yeah fine. In terms of your family history is there anything I should be aware of um related to kidneys, bladder, bowels, gut? Uh no I don't think so not that I not anything I know about. Okay all right and tell me a bit more about your home situation who's at home with you? Um so I live in a live in a flat near my college with uh a couple like friends of mine uh so I'm not like living at home or anything um okay and what do you say? That's what you're asking about sorry. Okay and are you are you working at the moon or are you a student? I'm a student. Okay and what are you studying? I'm studying biology. And how's that going? Um it's good yeah it's really it's really interesting uh learning about learning about how uh how the world works yeah. Great do you have any aspirations for the future in terms of careers? Uh I don't know maybe a doctor someday you never know. I recommend it we need doctors. Um what about smoking and alcohol do you drink much in a way of do you smoke or do you drink much in a way of alcohol? Uh I don't I don't smoke uh I do drink like on weekends. So socially okay all right um um right excellent so um at this stage I'll proceed examination but um based on your story um just to summarize really it's the last three days you've been having a bit of burning pain or passing urine a bit of crampy tummy pain lower down um essentially but but no other fevers or back pain if I understand correctly I think you probably do have what we call a simple UTI or a urinary tract infection bladder infection which can be readily treated so I'll give you a course of antibiotics today something called either nitrofurantoin or trimethoprine and it's normally a three-day course so one tablet twice a day for three days and that should hopefully help your symptoms but I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids let's try and flush that you know that infection out of your body if you can um you can try cranberry juice that can sometimes help with your symptoms um and if you're still not better by the end of this week I want you to give me a call or come back and see me and we can have another look at your symptoms okay so three days of the medication and then wait a little bit if it still doesn't go away call back yeah absolutely and things to look out for would be you know if you are having kind of high temperatures or back pain um just generally feeling more unwell uh you know do you want to give me a call back because then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys which is something we want to avoid so do give me a call if you have any concerns okay okay is there is there anything like like should I be worried about like like not having sex or anything within the next week or anything like this well I mean if you can try and avoid it I think that'd be sensible um it is greatly using barrier contraception I recommend you to continue using barrier contraception but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up that would be the best for you and your boyfriend okay all right that makes sense great okay thank you so much wish you all the best yeah thank you
