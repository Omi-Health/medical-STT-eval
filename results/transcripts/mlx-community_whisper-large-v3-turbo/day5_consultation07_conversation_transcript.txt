Okay, what can I do for you today? Well, five days ago I started having problems like a cough and my nose is just constantly streaming. Okay, and are you normally fit and well? Yeah, normally I'm diabetic but other than that, like generally pretty good. Right, okay, so just tell me about the last, did you say five days? Yeah, five days or so ago.

No. Chest what, sorry? Any pain in your chest? No. Any difficulty breathing, feeling short of breath or any pain when you take a deep breath? No, that's all fine. Have you coughed up any blood or anything like that? Nope. And what about your nose symptoms? On your chin, the front of your sinuses or anything? Nothing up in here but just constant streaming, like using a million tissues. Okay, and any blood coming from the nose? No, it's pretty green. Right, okay. Any other symptoms, like sore ears, sore throat? I've been feeling really hot. I don't know if it's fever as such but to touch I'm quite hot but sometimes I'm feeling really chilly and needing to be under a blanket, that sort of thing. Have you checked your temperature with the thermometer? No, I haven't. Okay. And are you eating and drinking normally? Yes, kind of around when it started I had some diarrhoea but I don't know if that was associated but since then it's all been pretty fine. Okay, so you're drinking while holding down fluids okay? Yeah. And passing water okay? Yeah, that's fine. You're vomiting diarrhoea now? No. Okay, that's fine. Any rashes that you've noticed? Rashes? Yeah. No, nothing like that. Any headaches or change in your vision? No, I've had quite achy muscles but that's pretty much it. Okay, and normally do you have any chest problems? No. Do you ever get wheezing, short of breath? I mean like if I do intense exercise, yes but not normally. And do you regularly have any infections in your chest or anything that needs treatment normally? No, I've got hypertension so I'm on some drugs for that but that's it really. Okay. Any other medical problems? Just the hypertension and the diabetes. Okay, and what type of drugs are you on? I think something called metformin and lisinapril I think is the other one. Okay, and when did you last have your blood pressure checked? Do you know if it's unstable? I can't remember. Okay. And with your blood, with your diabetes, have you had a blood test recently? Yeah. Yeah. Like, yeah it was normal. It was around three weeks ago. Okay. And do you know what dose of the lisinapril you're taking? Uh, 200. Okay. Have you been able to pass water normally? Any increase in the frequency that you're passing water or any increase in thirst? Uh, no not particularly. And has your weight been stable? Yeah. What is your weight and height? Uh, my height is 5'5". Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Uh, my partner and my dog. And do you work? Uh, yes. I'm an office manager. Okay. And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms? Anything that you've brought in the chemist? Um, quite a few LEMZPs. Um, they seem to be helping. Do you, what would you mean by quite a few? How many in a day do you normally take? Uh, maybe two or three. Maybe like at the start of the day and at the end of the day. Okay. Okay. Okay. Have you noticed any improvement in that? Yeah. It tends to soothe my throat a bit for when I'm going to sleep. Okay. Um, do you have any allergies to anything? Uh, I sometimes suffer from some like hay fever. Um, it's notلك anyلك anyلك anyلك anyلك anyلك anyلك anyلك anyلك anyلك anyلكلكلك throat a bit for when I'm going to sleep. Okay, do you have any allergies to anything? I sometimes suffer from some like hay fever, but it's not too bad. Any allergies to any medications at all? Not that I'm aware of, no. Okay, so what you've described to me, it sounds like you you probably have got an infection in the chest because it's it you know you're obviously getting the symptoms of your nose and your chest and it sounds like you might have it at high temperatures it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature. Okay, I can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something? Yeah, most of the time these infections are caused by viruses so they do normally settle by themselves but it can take you know a week or two and you can consistently have the cough ongoing longer than that. The important thing to do would be to check your temperature and if you feel like if the temperature is ongoing above 37.5, 38 and you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down or your coughs getting worse, you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out your nose and or any shortness of brain, chest pain, then we certainly would need to speak to you again. With the diabetes you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes so it's something that we do need to be careful of. Okay, so then we would look at potentially antibiotics at that time perhaps? Yeah, potentially if it is if it's not settling or the temperatures ongoing getting worse and we definitely need to talk to you again. Okay. Have you got any other questions? No, that's all fine. It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment with the LEMSIP. I wouldn't take and that's that contains paracetamol so don't take any other paracetamol containing products with that at the same time. The cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime because it's best for your body if you just keep coughing but if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all then it's okay to have a little bit of cough syrup just to settle that down. Okay, cool. Okay? Yep. Do you have blood sugar checking equipment? Do you check? I'm not at home. No. Okay. Well, if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your GP has asked you for? Yeah. Okay. Great. All right then. Take care. Thanks very much. Bye. Bye. Bye.
