Oh hello, I'm Dr Geraghty. Can I take your full name date of birth and your home address please? Yeah it's Gemma and 5 Kings Place. And are you in your date of birth? It's the 20th of the 4th, 1990. Okay and are you in a private place so you can have a confidential consultation today? Yes I am. What can I do for you today? I've got a really bad headache, had it for about a day now. Okay and can you just tell me about how it started, what were you doing when it came on? Yeah just yesterday morning since I woke up really, just yeah kind of throbbing, headache, haven't really wanted to leave the house much since then. Okay and where abouts in your head is the pain? Mainly on the left side. Okay and what does it feel like? It just kind of feels like it's throbbing, it's quite intense, it all comes and goes, yeah quite sensitive to light. Okay, when you say it comes and goes does it completely go away? It just kind of fades so it's still there a little bit but it kind of gets more or less severe. Okay and any other symptoms that you've had, any problems with your eyes or your eyesight? No not at all. Any abnormal smells or tastes? No. Any nausea, vomiting? No, no I've been feeling fine actually. And have you been eating and drinking okay? Yes, yes, same as normal. Okay and normally do you get any headaches? No not really, it's not something I've ever had before. Okay and has it occurred at a particular time in your menstrual cycle? No, not particularly, say my period was about a week ago. Right okay. And how were you the day before it came on? Have you had any other symptoms like feeling feverish, crotcheting, runny nose, sore ears? No, not really any sort of cold symptoms. I was feeling okay the day before. Okay and at the moment how are you feeling? It's still pretty bad, yeah, still kind of throbbing. Yeah. Have you had any changes in your skin? No, skin's been fine. Have you checked your temperature at all? Have you got a thermometer at home? I haven't, I don't feel like I'm feverish but I haven't checked. And any problems with weakness, tingling, numbness in your arms or legs? No, not at all. And what have you been doing since it came on? Have you been able to go to work or have you been at home? I've taken some painkillers, mainly been at home, yeah just kind of been able to go to work. Yeah, just kind of, kind of seems to be worse when I'm in a light room or like sunlight so I've kind of been staying in as much as possible. Okay. Does it get worse with any position that you're in? Is it worse when you lie flat or when you bend forward? No, I think I've generally been lying down, it's better that way. Any problems if you cough or sneeze? No, but I haven't really got a cough or anything. Okay. Can you just tell me a bit about your medical history in the past? Have you had any significant medical problems, any hospital admissions, operations and things like that? No, not recently, nothing. Do you take any medication? No, just contraception. And which contraception do you take? Microsbynons. When did you start that one? About six years ago. Do you get any side effects from it? Not really, no, not too much. Okay. And anyone in your family had any medical problems? My mum had high blood pressure and she's got a history of migraines. Okay. It's affected me before. And have you had your blood pressure checked for your care recently? I haven't actually, no. Have you had it checked when you've had the repeat prescription done? Yeah, so probably about six months ago. Do you know if there's been any problems with it? It's always been fine, I think. Okay. And whereabouts do you live at the moment? Who do you live with at home? Just with health mates, just friends. Okay. Do you drink much alcohol day to day? I'd say a normal amount. Probably a few drinks at the weekend. Okay. And do you smoke? No. Do you take any other drugs of any sort? No. So, what tablets did you say have been taking already? Sorry? What tablets have you been taking already for it? Just paracetamol. I'm allergic to aspirin, so I haven't been taking that. What happens when you take aspirin? I just feel really sick. Okay. And have you ever taken any non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, like ibuprofen, naproxen, anything like that? I have in the past. I haven't been taking it last year. Okay. So, this headache is new to you, and you've not had regular headaches before? Yeah. What I would suggest is taking some anti-inflammatories along with a paracetamol. Okay. You said you're eating okay? Yeah, yeah, fine. I mean, from the sounds of it, it does sound quite like a migraine, but obviously you've had no history of that in the past. And has anything changed recently, or anything you've done recently might have triggered it? Not like I can think of. I've been a bit stressed out of work, that kind of thing. Yeah. Well, that would be the first thing to do, is to take some anti-inflammatories along with a paracetamol, make sure you're really well hydrated, and see how that goes. And if it isn't settling, or it's getting worse, or you get any other change in your headache, or you're unwell with it, with a high temperature, then we would certainly need to speak to you straight away about that. The other thing is, if you're getting persistent headaches, or headaches associated with your cycle, or certain things seem to trigger these headaches, then it would be worth having a further discussion about it, to see whether we can work out if we can help that longer term. Okay, brilliant. Thank you. I would try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked, if you haven't had it checked for a while. Okay, cool. The thing to do is to have a thermometer at home, so you make sure that your temperature is okay. Yep. If you have a raised temperature, or your headache is just getting worse, and you develop any rashes, or anything like that, then we'd need to speak to you straight away. Yep, okay. That's brilliant. Okay, so I'll take some eye protection, and I'll hopefully be a bit better in a day, or two then. Okay, so have you got any other questions? No, that was it today. Okay. Okay, then we'll speak to you again. Okay, brilliant. Thanks so much. Thank you so much. Bye. Bye.
