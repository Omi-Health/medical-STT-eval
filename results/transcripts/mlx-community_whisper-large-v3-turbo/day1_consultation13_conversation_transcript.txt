There's no delays. Hello. Hi there. Hello there. Thanks for being here. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Yes, it's Adriana Katronjieva and I'm 26-year-old. Okay, Adriana, how can I help you this afternoon? Well, I have this really crazy headache that's been going on for a few days and it really annoys me. Oh dear, okay. When did it exactly start, this headache? Around three days ago, maybe. Three days ago, okay. And where about in your head is this pain? It's basically like, it kind of feels all over my head, but like mainly around my right eye. Okay. And is a headache there all the time or does it come and go? It kind of comes and goes, but I mean, it is there all the time, but like sometimes it's stronger. Okay, so it comes in fine. Okay. And if I was to ask you on a scale of one to ten, ten would be the worst type of pain you ever had. How would you rate this headache? It's probably an eight. Great. And if I was to ask you to describe the headache to me, in terms of the nature of the pain, is it sharp? Is it dull? Is it crampy? Is it throbbing? It's kind of, it's dull, but sometimes it gets a bit sharper. So basically it like, it developed gradually, I guess. It's like the first day it just started when I was at work. And by the end of the day, it was like pretty, pretty, like, it was a lot basically. And then I was thinking, okay, maybe I'll just go to sleep. And then I woke up the next morning. Like it was even, even worse basically. So you think the headache is getting worse in the last three days? Yeah. Okay. Have you tried anything which has made a headache better? Um, so I tried, uh, ibuprofen. Um, so I took like a few, um, for the last two days, basically. Does that help? But it doesn't really help. No. And in the past it did help me, which is why I decided to try it. But okay. Okay. All right. And except the headaches, any other symptoms at all? So, um, for example, any problems with your eyesight or your vision? Not really, but just when it started, I got this like weird shooting lights. And like, now like light is quite annoying my eyes. So when you say annoying, does it hurt to look, uh, look at bright lights? Yeah. Yeah. It hurts. So. Okay. Um, have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision? Not loss of vision, I wouldn't say. It's just like some lights from shooting lights. Okay. Okay. Any nausea or any vomiting? Um, well, I'm like, basically I'm sick with the headache, but I, no vomiting. Okay. Any neck pain or neck stiffness? No. Okay. Any difficulty with speaking or, um, speech? Okay. Any difficulty with, with weakness in your arms and legs? No. No. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. anyلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلك weakness in your arms and legs? No it's hard to focus though so I had to take a couple of days off work actually. Oh really? Okay okay well I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on. Any recent head injuries at all? No. Okay and have you had anything like this before in the past? Yeah I mean headaches you mean? Or similar to this kind of headache? Yeah I mean I had but usually after I take ibuprofen it kind of goes away so but this time it's just not. It's not okay all right. Any temperatures or fevers? No. Any rashes at all on your skin? No not at all I've noticed. Okay and just moving forward are you otherwise fit and well Adriana? Am I what sorry? Are you fit and well? Do you have any other medical history? I think so it's just a headache. Any history of migraines at all? Not myself I've never had a migraine but my sister and my mum have them quite frequently. Okay fine I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second before I go any further can I ask do you take any regular medication? No. Are you on the pill? No. Okay do you have any allergies to medications? Not that I know of. Okay so you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines. Yeah. Are they is that normally well controlled or are they having difficulty controlling the symptoms? So my sister's like better like it's kind of it's very rare but my mom's is like quite bad usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that it's yeah it takes her out for a few days basically. Right okay fine. Socially tell me a bit more about your life outside of outside of work so who lives at home with you? I live with housemates so three of them. Excellent and are you working at the moment? You mentioned this is impacting your work. Yeah so I work well I work in IT so I work with computers a lot so it kind of is difficult to focus. I had to like reduce the brightness of my screen. Okay do you wear glasses? Yes I do. Have you any recent eye check done eye tests? No I've been wearing them since I was five year old. Okay. I'm free to bear in mind if you feel like your eyes are straining. I always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Have you been more stressed or anxious at work recently? Well it's been a bit stressful kicking off a new project but yeah nothing out of the ordinary really. Okay all right. Regarding smoking or alcohol do you drink or smoke at all? I socially smoke and I drink not only socially. Only socially. Okay. Right now Adriana do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Have you have you read anything online or spoken to people? Not really. At first I thought it's stress or maybe I didn't drink enough water because sometimes when I don't drink enough water I get headaches. I don't think that's it. And I'm like worried. I don't want it to be a migraine because I know what it's like from my mom and my sister and it's really annoying so I really don't want to have that. And I know it's genetic so I've researched that but I don't know if that is the case. So yeah. Is it anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today? Yeah maybe just kind of if you have any recommendations of I can take something stronger because apparently ibuprofen doesn't help me. Usually it gets resolved if I have headache and like after like one or two days but currently it didn't help me. How many tablets did you take of ibuprofen? Three a day. Three a day. Okay all right. So Adriana so really what I think is going on here unfortunately I do think this could be a headache very similar to migraine. The reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it given your mom and your sister also have migraines. I think it's something for us to think about. Now I'm not saying it's going to keep happening but it may just be a one-off but it's only worth treating it today with some stronger analgesia or painkillers. Now moving forward we have some options which we can discuss. You try the ibuprofen. Now my only worry is I'm not sure whether you're taking the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets three times a day. Oh right. There's definitely room for improvement there or I can prescribe you something stronger like naproxen which is another anti-inflammatory which can be helpful. We can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or codeine which might be helpful as well. Yeah I think codeine is what my mom takes for when she has migraines. Okay I think it's only worth looking into it so I can give you a prescription for that today. With regards to the next few days it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's you know if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse. And you know I'd like you to come back and see me in about a week's time, week to two weeks time. If you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches we can think about giving you medications as prophylactic which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis. But we can have that discussion next time. Okay. Okay. In the meantime if your headaches aren't getting any better or they're getting worse um you know I want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner okay. Okay. If you have any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs or you're just not feeling very well just give me a call and come back and see me. Okay. All right. Great. Great. We'll have a good day. Thank you. You too. Bye. Bye.
