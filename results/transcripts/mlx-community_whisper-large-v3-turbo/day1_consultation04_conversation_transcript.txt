Alex oh hello how can you hear me yeah okay great how can I help you this morning sir I've been feeling I've been feeling kind of under the weather for the past four days it started with the sore throat and runny nose and it's sort of it's sort of going into a cough now sore throat is kind of going away but I'm starting to cough mm-hmm okay so I hear that kind of bad and tired hmm okay I'm sure here I think there's a lot going on there so let's start with your your sore throat first tell me a bit more about that if you can um so I I you know I think I it all started with the colleague of mine she just kept sneezing next to me all the time I think her kids are catching something from there from their kindergarten or something and you know that it it started as normal sore throat and okay was quite painful for a couple days but then it was fast okay okay and did you have any difficulty or pain or swallowing yeah yeah it was it was quite painful to swallow okay for one of the days you managed you must have a look in the back of your throat in the mirror um no not really no okay you didn't you didn't notice any abnormal white spot redness at the back of your throat um no I didn't think about uh looking that's okay that's okay and you mentioned a runny nose um again what kind of discharge is coming out is it clear or is it a bit more colored yeah yeah it's yeah it's clear but sort of um sort of getting my nose stuffed all the time it's very hard to uh to get it free okay do you feel quite congested you yeah quite congested okay fine um you also mentioned a cough as well can you tell more about that um yeah that started recently like just uh maybe yesterday and um it's uh it's dry for now it's not very painful but it's sort of there all the time okay and is it worse at any particular time of the day sorry is it is it worse at any particular time of the day for example in the evenings night time mornings or is it throughout the day no it's it's um it's sort of it's sort of constant okay um I forgot to mention that um I'm also having uh night sweats night sweats okay that's very odd actually and uh sort of makes me a bit tired hmm and it makes my treatment a bit uneasy I can imagine yes and this is again been going on for the last uh three four days has it yeah yes okay um right okay have you noticed any fevers or temperatures at all um I I had some some fever in the beginning but it's now sort of uh going down I've been taking some paracetamol and ibuprofen for that and uh they they help that's very sensible um very good um in terms of your chest otherwise have you any difficulty breathing or any pain in your chest um so no pain in chest but uh I noticed that I um um so I feel a bit winded on exertion so if I I haven't been going going to the gym best uh because of that when you say winded do you feel uh do you feel more shorter breath would you say on exertion okay um and and that's mainly on exercise but when you're resting there's no problem yeah yeah when when when I'm resting it's okay so I've been actually going to work and sort of managing okay fine just a couple other questions surface if you don't mind any pain in your ears at all um no no you don't feel blocked or any discharge coming at your ears no I don't think so okay fine um what I'm gonna do I'm gonna run through a few uh yes no questions if you if you don't mind just a review of your systems any any headaches at all um yeah yeah that that's still that's still there whereabouts are the headaches um just sort of general um and uh they're not they're not always there but you know every now and then they would come and go okay and with those headaches have you any problems with your eyesight your vision um no any difficulty with seeing bright lights um no I don't think so no okay um and just moving down now in terms of any any feeling nausea or any vomiting no none of that okay tell me about your bowels are your bowels working okay um yeah yeah I think so passing urine okay yeah yeah how's your appetite sir yeah I've been I've been drinking a little bit more than the usual but uh so other than that okay um and you're eating and drinking are you eating okay otherwise um maybe a bit less than uh than what I would usually have okay um have you ever seen any funny rashes at all on your skin um no no and any general muscle pain or aches joint pain yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's sort of started in the past couple days yeah okay all right um and uh just have a look at the rest of your history are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of um so otherwise that I'm fine there's um there isn't anything that I'm taking or I'm being treated for okay um so you're otherwise fitting well uh any any allergies at all to any medications I should be aware of um no no no okay um any family history at all so anything relevant in the family that I should be aware of thinking about diabetes high blood pressure um yeah my grandma has diabetes um your brother and my grandma oh you say grandma sorry my apologies grandma okay uh do you know what type of diabetes it is is it type 1 I think it's type 2 okay um anything else which you think is significant yeah I I think um one of my uh great granddads had an eczema excellent okay okay um just moving on to what we say so social history just get to know you a bit more as a person tell me who do you live with at home um I live alone okay and you said you're working at the moment is that right yeah yeah what do you do for work um I'm an accountant okay and how's your work going at the moment over the last time has it has it been affecting your work um a little bit I've been a bit slower and you know it's uh it's it's a bit of a stressful period just around the end of the year right okay is that stress affecting your um your mood at all in any way um no I think I think it's it's the you know it's the good kind of stress so okay it's good work well if there's anything you ever want to talk to me about you can always come and see me about your mood and stress and anxiety we're happy to help no no I I I like my job it's just you know it's a bit more work okay okay and just very briefly in terms of smoking uh do you smoke at all um yeah occasionally no cigars and things on company parties okay so not not regular um and what about alcohol um occasionally I would have some I'm not a very drinker again socially with work um okay um so um so just having listened to your story um uh really just to summarize you know the last four days you've been feeling generally quite unwell sore throat runny nose bit of a dry cough bit of muscle pain weakness um had an initial fever but now settled um I don't think there's a lot to worry about I think you probably have you know a bit of a viral what we say viral illness and maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection or maybe early signs of a flu um it normally lasts about seven to ten days and just gets better really um over time but things you can do to really help yourself um is get plenty of rest I'll probably advise you taking a day or two of work if you can um making yourself you know pushing fluids and make yourself well hydrated continuing with the regular paracetamol and ibuprofen um and and we should see how things go really um if next week is still not better I'd like you to come back and see me um is that clear? does that make that's all good it makes sense I think I think I'll take a couple days off yeah and see how it goes and things to look out for if you're really not getting better if you have a high fever or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored or chest pain I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner give me a call um and we we can help you out okay? yeah yeah understood I'll uh I'll take care great have a great day good luck with your work thank you thank you you too bye bye
