Hello? Oh, hello. Hi. Hi, how are you doing? My name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? Yeah, I'm Daniel. Hi, Daniel. And your date of birth? Yeah, male, 1992. 92. Okay, Daniel. And are you in a comfortable and confidential place to talk? Yeah, totally. Happy to go ahead. Great. How can I help? Yeah, I just... My chest has been feeling really tight. Okay. And how long has this been going for, Daniel? For about three hours now. Okay. And so tight chest, three hours. And so you were born in 92, so it makes you 26. 26, yeah. And you are... Any shortness of breath at all? Yeah, like a little bit. Yeah, like a little bit. Yeah, a little bit short of breath. Not too bad. Any cough, wheeze? Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well. Because of coughing. Coughing, yeah. Tight cough, yeah. Yeah. Sore throat, runny nose, sore ears. You know, I had a cold last week and it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose, just feeling under the weather. Mm-hmm. You feeling better now than the tight chest? I mean, I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore. Right. Okay. Okay, but now you've got this... So you've still got symptoms of a cold, essentially? Yeah, the cough's kind of stuck around. Yeah, okay. Are you coughing up anything? Uh, no. And, um, do you have any other medical problems, like asthma? Yeah, yeah, I have asthma, I've had it for a while now. Um, and then I have like a hay fever, you know, some allergies to dust. Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any medications? Um, yeah. So, you know, the, um, Ventolin, it's called Salbutamol. Yeah. I got that one and then I have a steroid, uh, Clenol, Clenol inhaler. Clenol Modulate, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. And, um, uh, have you been using Clenol and the Ventolin and how often have you been using them? Um, well, to be honest, I was away at uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me. So I haven't really in the past week. Both of them. Because, because, um, sorry, they ran out and I, I forgot to go and grab the next one. Yeah, sure. About a week ago. Okay. All right. All right. So, so you, so you, you haven't got any Clenol or any Ventolin at the moment? Not with me right now. No, I ran out. Okay. All right. Um, and, uh, any drug allergies that you know of? No, no, not allergic to anything. Just like, just the dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs. Okay, great. Now, uh, do you, anyone in your family have any medical problems you know of? Um, yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Oh, oh, when I was young, I also had eczema and I had a milk protein allergy when I was young too. Mm. Okay. Um, all right. So just, uh, do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or, um, hopes for this consultation? Not really. Like, I feel like asthma is probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers wouldn't be helpful. Um, it's just kind of scary because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight, uh, in a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I can, I can imagine. Um, well, it's certainly sounds like, uh, you've, you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough, um, and it's non-productive cough and you're short of cough. Uh, is the cough worse at night time? I mean, it gets a little bit worse at night, but basically just pretty consistent. Yeah. It hasn't gone away. Okay. And you've got this tight, tight chest. But you wouldn't say you've got chest pain, it's more of a tight chest, is it? No, not really pain. It's more like tight. It just feels like sometimes I can't get a full breath in, you know? Yeah, sure. Um, okay. Well, I would quite like to, uh, certainly get you some, uh, Ventolin, clinical modulate. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit more like back in high school. Um, but I've been pretty good at taking my inhalers. So not, not so much anymore. Have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient, as in, you know, stayed in there overnight for asthma? Yeah. When I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat. Oh, okay. So, so, so you, uh, you, uh, you went to hospital and had a, uh, so you stayed in hospital for a few days. Did you with an asthma exacerbation? Yeah, I did. Yeah. Okay. But currently you're just on Ventolin and Clinol and you haven't got any of those steroids, uh, those inhalers at the moment. I'd be pretty good. I'd be pretty good just on the Clinol and the Salbutamol. Okay. When, sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation? Uh, I think I was like 17, 16, maybe. Sure. Okay. Um, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,لكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلكلك of breath than i would normally be sure yeah okay but you're not sure a breath of rest at the moment no no no i'm not okay fine so what what i think um and just just go over is there anything you'd hoped about getting other than the uh a prescription for your inhalers was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting from this i just want to know that i'm okay so just like keep i just don't want to have to get um that that intubation again sure yeah absolutely okay well i'm really glad you spoke to me today i think what we can do is is give you a prescription for uh some more of the inhalers we can get that to you within the hour i would hope um and uh i think what the other thing i'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids so this is these are tablets which um you can take for five days uh two tablets in the morning and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response okay okay um now there are some side effects to the steroids which i should really tell you about but please read the label it's associated don't be too worried about the side effects they're uncommon most you know most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated and uh you probably do have you had them in the past you know sorry sorry you were cutting in and out a little bit there what are you saying have you had steroids in the past um i can't remember probably probably yeah so um they they can come they can make you your mood change can be slightly low or slightly high can give you a high blood sugar um and uh that okay they can also cause rash nausea um headaches but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help your asthma an awful lot um uh what i like to do is is send you these the some prescriptions for your uh inhalers are ongoing so you um you can once you get better from this asthma attack you can you can use the clino modulate in the morning with ventolin as a prn but so a ventolin when you need to um when you're getting ready if you should start to use the ventolin more than uh every three hours uh at any time it's a good idea to seek medical attention so um see a doctor um in some capacity uh and the other thing i'd like to send you is a spacer which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better have you do you know what spacer is have you used one before yeah yeah i somebody told me how to use them a while ago i don't i don't really use it to be honest but have you got one i think i do i have one somewhere okay all right well um i'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it but essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside breathing in and out um uh for five or five or ten breaths okay yeah so uh was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage i think you got me covered okay and and uh i might give you some time off work as well you can self-certify for seven days but uh i think i would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better if you're okay with that all right all righty well thank you very much no worries any deterioration in your symptoms like worsening shortness of breath um or just generally concerning symptoms uh pain in your chest tightness uh feeling lightheaded uh then seek further medical attention and okay all right sounds good okay thank you okay thank you bye-bye bye-bye
