Hi there, good morning. Hello, good morning. I'm Dr Dean Mirza from GP at hand, nice to see you. Nice to see you. Okay, before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth? Yes, my name is John Smith and I was born on the 5th of April 1973. Okay, that's great, thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes, absolutely. Okay, so tell me a bit about what's been happening. You mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow. Yeah, I just noticed this like about a week ago or something. I have like a weird swelling on my elbow. I noticed that when I was in the shower. It's not painful at all. I feel fine, but it's just a bit weird to see that. Sure. It's slightly warm and I kind of feel like it's a bit fluid inside or… Sure, sure. So I want to know what's going on with me. And so did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow? It's the left elbow. Left elbow, okay. And have you banged that elbow? Did you have any kind of injury? No, not really. Not that I know of. I haven't noticed anything. I can actually like do it normally. It's just… I can just see that it feels a bit strange. Sure, okay. And in terms of your job, do you do anything physical? Not really, no. I just, you know, sit at the desk. Right. Yeah. Okay. And has this happened before? No, no, I haven't noticed that before. I don't have any like, history of seeing this. I don't remember. But I don't know about that. Sure, okay. And can I just double check? Has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that? No, well, I do. Well, I think… I think I have something like osteoarthritis. It sometimes kind of hurts my joints. But in my family, I'm not sure. Okay. No, no. Sure. So, you know, you said you think you've got osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis? Yes. Yes. A few years ago. Okay. Was that a GP or a specialist or… is it a physiotherapy? A GP. A GP. Okay. All right. Sorry. Can I just double check how old you are, please? I'm 53. 53. Okay. All right. And do you have any other illnesses at all? Well, not really, no. I'm allergic to peanuts. Right. Okay. That's pretty much, yeah. I have to say about my medical… Okay. Yeah. Are you allergic to any medication? No. Not that I know of. Sure. And do you… are you on any medication on a regular basis? No. No. No. Okay. And are you normally fit and well, mobile, active? Yeah. I do… I do… I do some sports. I run regularly, like two, three times a week. Yeah, no, I'm… I think I'm healthy. Okay. Good. Good. Well done. That's good that you're doing that on a regular basis. Okay. And can I… is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now? Yes, sure. Okay. Bear with me one second. Right. Okay. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that, a bit higher so I can just see the underside? Okay. Fantastic. All right. And then just bring it around to this side, essentially. I can see the other side. Okay. Fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of the elbow with your fingers, is it hot compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin? It's a bit warm, yes. It's a bit warmer. Okay. And is it very tender when you're pressing on that now? If you give it a press, does it hurt you at all? On the tip of the elbow, it's okay. Just like next to it, like where the swelling is, it's a bit… yeah, it feels a bit fluid. Okay. All right. I noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow. Do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body? No, no, no. I have more skin. I'm pretty dry now. Do you suffer from eczema at all? No. No. All right. Okay. So, what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem, okay, is I think it would be worthwhile. This seems like what we call the bursitis, okay? So that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. What I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication in the first instance. And as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done. To check for other types of causes of joint swelling, okay? So what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some blood test forms to be sent out to your house. And there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done. And that will involve you having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies. So we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well, okay? Okay. The timeframe for that will be the results will come back to us after about five, six days. Okay. Now, you take time for the forms come out to you. And then you get the forms that test does straight away. By the time that we're expecting a result back, you know, one or two days after that, we're looking at maybe six days. maybe six days and what i'd suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint feel it we can review the blood tests and we can um get a gauge as to uh what's going on now in terms of your joint right now it doesn't look like to me that's something called excuse me septic arthritis so we are worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint um and your your joint doesn't look like that however if your the elbow was to become very red very painful uh and the redness was to spread or become you know more intense then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment more immediate treatment okay do you think it's something dangerous like something like could i die from that or is it no i don't think this is anything dangerous i don't need to worry okay what i'm doing is i'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop okay so if we're going to work then this this is not the case right now right now it looks quite straightforward it's nothing sinister or life threatening um what i'm doing is i'm just saying in case things worsen these are the things that we'll be looking out for and this is what we have to do but you don't have that now thankfully and i don't think you're going to have it but i'm just saying the what if scenario is that okay yeah that that sounds good thank you all right did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me um well just yeah i just wanted to know about this um yeah it feels a bit better now to know that okay all right um yeah no that's it thank you okay so i i would take ibuprofen regularly okay you can get that over the counter um that's 400 milligrams two times a day and you should take that after food not an empty stomach if you get any heartburn stop taking it okay sure all right so what i want to do is i'll get the form sent out to you and um we are going to arrange a follow-up appointment maybe within a um actually you know the phone doesn't have to be face to face if it's more convenient to do it over the phone we can do that over the phone over video you can do that as well that's your call but you contact us after you've had the blood test done or we can review things then okay okay yeah that sounds good i i'll do that and if i see that it's getting worse i'll probably ask for a physical appointment but sure sure that's good all right then okay um take care then so just leave that with me i'll sort all those bits and pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll we'll review you after the test all right all right take care all the best bye bye bye
