next door hello hi can you hear me okay yeah i can hear you right excellent before i go any further can i confirm your name and your age please sure um i'm amanda jackson and i'm 19 years old 19 years old okay amanda and how can i help you this afternoon um so it's been going on for a few days now um it's not happened before and i'm a bit worried it hurts when i kind of pee um and yeah it's like i'm going to the toilet a lot more um and it's really like i can't like go to uni properly i'm just like constantly looking for the toilet um it kind of hurts sometimes when i'm like in the bottom of my tummy as well right okay i'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and i can see why it's affecting you um so you mentioned it's been going on for the last three days mainly the burning pain when you pass urine um you're going to the toilet more often as well is that right uh yeah it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days i think actually maybe just under a week oh under the week sorry um okay sorry no i didn't explain it properly before um yeah no i it's been going on for about just under a week um and yeah i just sort of burning stinging when i when i go to the toilet yeah have you noticed any anything in your urine for company blood or um discoloration of urine um i think well today i noticed um it was like a bit pink the the urine yeah i think just today we didn't see any kind of frank blood i mean red blood at all in your urine um i think it was mixed in probably i don't know it was pink so okay um fine we'll have to definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on um you also mentioned some tummy pain as well can you tell me a bit more about that pain yeah it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy um mainly when i go to the loo i think that's when it's worse okay um can you describe it as a crampy pain is it more of a burning pain pain um i wouldn't describe it as crampy i don't think it's like a period pain it's a bit different it's it's hard to say an achy pain i suppose okay okay does the pain move anywhere else is moved towards your back towards your sides no no okay all right um any other symptoms as well for example nausea vomiting no no nausea vomiting okay any temperatures or fevers um no no not that i've noticed okay all right and how are your bowels at the moment are your bowels working okay uh i i usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway so i don't think it's any different okay what it usually is when you say you have problems what kind of problems you normally have um i think i have um ibs um so i just kind of pass my bowels like quite quite a lot um and sometimes it's quite it's quite variable like sometimes it's a bit softer sometimes it's a bit it's sorry this is a bit disgusting but like sometimes it's a bit harder and kind of hard to predict okay all right but there's no no no no new symptoms in your bowels no no no all right um and amanda sometimes we have to ask quite a sensitive questions as you can imagine um uh can i ask are you currently uh are you currently sexually active at the moment uh yeah um i have a a long-term um boyfriend okay and um have you noticed any other discharge from down below so from the front passage um no no i don't think so nothing unusual okay have you do you use any form of contraception uh yeah uh i'm um on the pill what kind of pill is it a combined pill or the mini pill uh combined pill okay fine um when was the last time you had um unprotected sex if you don't want me asking uh i mean i mean unprotected is it like no no condoms or anything yeah exactly i guess because i don't really use condoms with my boyfriend just like i don't know we've just kind of agreed uh so uh i guess a week ago two weeks ago okay all right what i'm trying to get at is whether um there's any chance you could be pregnant at all i know you're on the pill but we nonetheless we do have to ask um when was your last when was your last period um two weeks ago two weeks ago okay all right just something to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better okay um fine in terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you uh eating and drinking okay uh yeah yeah eating drinking okay um i did have one kind of concern i don't know so i smoked uh this is quite bad but i smoked weed for the first time like a week and a half ago i just wonder whether it's related at all probably not but i just thought i'd get some advice from you sure well well thanks for sharing with me um so i don't think it is related to your symptoms i think it's probably just pure coincidence um but uh you know i do strongly advise you to you know make it a regular habit if you can um just for your general health moving forwards okay um moving on in terms of your health otherwise do you have any other medical conditions i should apart from the ibs is there anything else i should be aware of no no okay great and what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the um combined pill apart from the pill um i take um something for the ibs as well um it begins with an m it's really hard to pronounce like maybe something maybe yeah okay yeah yeah that's it yeah yeah that's right okay and the left of the cramps the crampy pain yeah yeah yeah and do you have any allergies any medications um yeah i think there's an antibiotic um called clindis clindamycin that i took like a couple years ago something and yeah that that didn't go too well right with me okay sure i'll make a note of that um in terms of family history any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys no no no anything else good and socially tell me a bit more about your home situation who's at home with you um so i am living in halls at the moment uh uni um so i'm just living with a flatmate i suppose um but my family uh live kind of outside of london not too far away um so yeah my family are fine and i see them now and then very good yeah things i think i think okay generally great and what are you studying university i'm studying english english okay good and how are you enjoying your course yeah yeah it's going well thanks just kind of started a few months ago a few months ago yeah i really enjoy it very good um in terms of smoking and alcohol do you do participate in either uh as i admitted before i tried weed first time uh but i don't smoke uh i drink occasionally um kind of socially um with friends okay what what made you have your first joint last week um i i was just a party um a lot of people doing it um i kind of was a little bit tipsy so probably wasn't thinking quite straight um but yeah i completely agree it's not something i want to get into on a regular basis sure and obviously as your doctor said i took off to you so i would strongly recommend you you know to avoid it great um fine so at this end i wouldn't normally examine you but i think based on your story i think um you know i'm reassured by the fact i i think it's um probably just a simple what we say uti or a cystitis bladder infection um you know you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about so things like fevers and back pain um would be more worrying for me to hear um so something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics um so we've got choice two antibiotics something called trimethoprine or nitrofurantoin which is a three-day course normally they're usually quite effective um for your symptoms it's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well if you can so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there um start the antibiotics make sure you're well hydrated drink plenty of fluids um yeah if you are having some pain simple paracetamol um would probably be advisable um okay we'll see what the urine sample shows um and if it is indeed positive we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones um but if things are still getting better next week come back and see me and we can have another look again okay okay uh great um with with the urine sample and how do i go about doing that so no uh well that's a good question so i will give you i will organize uh for you to come in and drop up a sample at one of our practices um which we can test there and then and with a urine and then send off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results okay okay do bear in mind those symptoms i mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting if you have any of those give me a call okay either back pain okay okay have a good day okay thank you
