Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me okay? I can hear you but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Is that okay? Am I meant to just have a connection on the screen? It's audio. No, no, it's up to you fine. Now before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? So my name is Dan Chowdhury. I am 27. 27, okay. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan? So I've just been having some troubles. Basically, I guess it's been a little while now and I've just been feeling not so great and it's all come from like, it's like basically I think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out like loads of it. Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and yeah, it doesn't feel very solid. It's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's uh yeah, it's just uh not not being very pleasant and like I just it just kind of hasn't doesn't feel like it's getting better. So wow, no, sorry to hear. I think that there's a lot going on there. When did it all start your symptoms? Um, so I think it was a few when I think about it. So Monday, Tuesday, I saw I think it was about three, it's been about three days now. Okay, and is it mainly diarrhea? So you mentioned watery stools. Um, how many times are you going a day would you say? Um, so I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Um, right, you're losing a lot of fluid there. Yeah, so I mean I'm trying to drink a lot of water but um yeah, it's just quite a lot and uh it's yeah, I think I feel like it's just just fluids coming out. Okay, have you got any blood in your stools? Um, so I no, I don't remember anything like no, I think it's just nothing like that. There's nothing like that. And any any tummy pain? Any any any pain in your tummy? Yeah, I mean I it I feel I feel a cramp and then and then I know it's time to go right. So around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go. So yeah, I mean that's that's the kind of first sign. Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? It's kind of as I want to if I think about it's like it's like at the bottom. I don't know if that makes sense. Yeah, well why don't we start with is it is it in the middle or is it to one particular side? Um, I I think it feels pretty like in the middle to me not on any side left or right. Okay, and does this pain come and go or is it there constantly? Um, it it comes and goes. It comes and goes. Fine, okay. And if I was asking a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you've ever had, how bad is this pain? Okay, so like um so what do you mean by uh pain? So I I think it's maybe is it is this pain that's making you double over? Is it ten is it ten out of ten the worst pain you've ever had or is it more of a kind of a mild pain like a three out of ten? I I guess so I'm when I think about it like when I get it I can pretend that I don't feel it so I can still sit down and I can still like cover it up and people don't really notice so I I don't know what that means but maybe is that like a six or a seven? I think it's almost six okay. Okay. All right good. Um, apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Um, yeah, I definitely I definitely feel kind of nauseous. um like I and like I've have vomited and when I like I think it's maybe something to do with like whenever I have like milk or something like that I just feel like I want to vomit and actually like yeah one time I just like had some milk and I just completely vomited it. Okay, all right. I've been trying to avoid it but um yeah. The vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea, is that right? No, no, no it's not. Okay, okay. All right. Um any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? Um, so I yeah, I think I am pretty I feel kind of really hot all the time and um I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that but it's uh yeah I've I'm not uh like not a normal temperature. Okay, so you're feeling hot. Okay. And in terms of your waterworks, are you passing urine okay? Um yeah, but I guess less frequently maybe um but yeah it seems to be okay. Okay, all right. Um fine and you said you mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean have you for example gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else and with diarrhea for example? Um so I know so my um my brother has had actually had something like this for um he has it as well for five days as well um and I I I'm not yeah I can't think of what what the trigger is for me. I mean my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me but yeah that's why. Is your brother now better? Um he so he's been like this for five days I think he's getting better but I'm not I'm not really sure he said he said he had he's had something for a little while as well. Okay all right are you having anything to eat a drink? I can see you're drinking your coffee but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? Um so it just feels like um the the fluids do go down but it just feels like it's going straight through just feels like it's going straight through. Okay all right fine when was last time anything solid to eat and which kept which uh which you kept in? Um so I had some I mean I had some lunch today um but again it just it just came come out pretty loose. Okay all right um and and Dan moving forward are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical history? Um so I um yeah I think I think otherwise um fit well I um yeah I mean I I'm an okay weight and um I I can't think of any related medical history um I mean like my yeah no I don't think so. I'll take it you don't take any regular medications then? So I um no I mean I I've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately but I haven't been I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. Okay and do you have any allergies any medications? um so I don't have any allergies that I know of. Okay and what about any family history do you have any family history of bowel problems? Um so with bowel like does is the colon like something? Yeah so what I mean by bowel is the whole gut really anything from the mouth or the penis? So my yeah my my dad actually has um colon cancer at the moment. Oh dear I'm very sorry to hear that. How is he? So um from what I heard he's kind of so I don't I don't speak to him that often so I don't I don't know the exact details and I I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing but um he's sort of in his third stage I'm not sure what that means exactly um yeah okay yeah so yeah it's it's um he's yeah you can I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting me a lot and um that's it's quite I I guess he's um had it for a little while now. Well I'm really sorry I'll make a note of that because uh it's important to know these kind of details um and socially tell me more about your home situation who's at home with you Dan? Um so uh not my brother he doesn't live with me I'm I live with my um sister and my mum. Okay and uh how are things at home? Um in what sense do you mean that? In general day-to-day life are you managing okay? Any particular circumstances? I mean uh I think uh yeah it's been it's been tricky um going to work with all of this um I dislike um taking time off work I feel like I just want to go um when I can so I try and go um I think at home uh yeah I just haven't really um I don't normally actually um eat with my family I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing so I don't think it's affected them and I haven't really been I haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mum about it um yeah I'd just rather deal with these things um so what are you mentioning? You mentioned work what is it you do for work? um so I work at a I work at um an office um in central London um it's uh so I work in government government okay so office okay right there's a couple of last final couple a couple of questions there smoking and alcohol do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? um so I I smoke um I smoke uh uh for like socially but not like regularly um so normally if it's a Friday or something like that I might I might have a cigarette or something like that but um um sorry and alcohol so alcohol um you know I might have a beer during the weekdays maybe uh not that many maybe um on Fridays I have more um alcohol um but yeah I buy a lot more units um on it I suppose um not every week but maybe uh once or twice a month but yeah I'll go out with my friends and drink a lot so that that's um yeah well thank you for sharing with me that's very helpful to know so um Dan just as a conclusion um just to wrap it all up I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis okay a bit of a basically infection of your tummy okay okay there's nothing to worry about I um I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days just like it did for your brother drink make sure you drink plenty of fluids okay um you can should I just drink like normal water I just feel like every time I drink it's just coming out um but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins um so you can get things like diarolite which is a fluid replacement we can get from the pharmacy it's probably worth recommending that do I need like a prescription for that no you can just get that over the counter okay um you can try just you know regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish but if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days so 48 hours I want you to give me a call back because um you know if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations okay but I think let's let's see how you are the next one to two days okay and uh we'll catch up soon okay okay so you're saying that I should I could uh I'll try and buy this diarolite what what should I do in terms of um food and that kind of thing should I just focus on fluids food dissolving yeah absolutely it's a clear fluid you can use soft diet things like soup mash and then gradually build up um as much as your body can tolerate um but really let's try and keep yourself well hydrated first okay okay is it okay for me to carry on having like um paracetamol and things like that absolutely if you are having if you've got a bit of tummy pain if you're feeling feverish then I think paracetamol is very sensible okay okay try and avoid alcohol if you can uh okay I'll try yeah okay all right then okay thank you for your help all right thank you very much thanks thanks for helping me out bye
