Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Can you hear me okay?
I can hear you but I can't really see you.
That's perfect.
Is that okay? Am I meant to just...
It's audio. No, no, it's absolutely fine.
Now before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age?
Um, so, um, so my name is Dan Choudhury. I am 27.
27, okay. And how can I help you yourself today, Dan?
Um, so I've just been having some troubles. Basically in the... it was... I guess it's been a little while now and I've just been feeling not so great and it's all come from like... uh... it's like basically I think it's diarrhea and it's just coming out like loads of it. Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and yeah, doesn't feel very solid. It so just it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's uh... yeah, it's just uh not not being very pleasant and like I just it just kind of hasn't doesn't feel like it's getting better so...
Wow, no, sorry to hear. It seems like there's a lot going on there. When did it all start, your symptoms?
Um, so I think it was a few... when I think about it... so Monday, Tuesday... I so I think it was about three... it's been about three days now.
Okay. And is it mainly diarrhea? So you mentioned watery stools. Um, how many times are you going a day would you say?
Um, so I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Um...
Right, wow. Okay, so you're losing a lot of... you're losing a lot of fluid there.
Yeah, so I mean I'm trying to drink a lot of water but um, yeah, it's just quite a lot and uh it's yeah, I think I feel like it's just just fluids coming out.
Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stools?
Um, so I... no I don't remember anything like... no, I think it's just nothing like that. It's nothing like that.
And any tummy pain? Any pain in your tummy with...
Yeah, I mean I feel I feel a cramp and then and then I know it's time to go, right? So around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go so yeah, I mean that's that's the kind of the sign.
Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy?
It's kind of... so when I... if I think about it it's like... it's like at the bottom. Uh I don't know if that makes sense. Um...
Yeah. Well why don't we start with is it is it in the middle or is it to one particular side?
Um, I think it feels pretty like in the middle to me, not on any side, left or right.
Okay. And does this pain come and go or is it there constantly?
Um, it it comes and goes. It comes and goes.
Fine. Okay. And if I was to ask you on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you ever had, how bad is this pain?
Okay, so like... um... I... so... what do you mean by uh pain? So I think it's maybe...
Is this pain that's making you double over? Is ten is it ten is it a ten the worst pain you've ever had or is it more of a kind of a mild pain like a three out of ten?
I guess so I'm... when I think about it like when I get it I can pretend that I don't feel it so I can still sit down and I can still like cover it up and people don't really notice so I don't know what that means but maybe is that like a six or a seven?
Yeah, sound like a solid six actually. Okay. All right, good.
Um, apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting?
Um, yeah I definitely I definitely feel kind of nauseous um like I and like I've have vomited and when I... like I think it's maybe something to do with like whenever I have like milk or something like that I just feel like I want to vomit and actually like yeah one time I just like had some milk and I just completely vomited it.
Lost it eating. Okay, all right.
I've been trying to avoid it but um, yeah.
But the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea, is that right?
Um... sorry, could you repeat that?
The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhea, is that right?
Oh no, no it's not.
Okay, okay, all right. Um, any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures?
Um, so I... yeah, I think I am pretty I feel kind of really hot all the time and um I pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that but it's uh yeah I I feel pretty sure I'm I'm not uh like not a normal temperature.
Okay, so you're feeling hot. Okay. And in terms of your waterworks, are you passing urine okay?
Um, yeah, but I guess less frequently maybe. Um, but yeah it seems to be okay.
Okay, all right.
Um, fine. And you said mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean have you for example gone out, had some takeaway food, have you been around anyone else with diarrhea for example?
Um, so I know so my um my brother has had actually had something like this for um fi... he has it as well for five days as well. Um, and I I I'm not... yeah I can't think of what what the trigger is for me. I mean my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me but yeah I that's why...
Is your brother now better?
Um, he... so he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better but I'm not I'm not really sure. Or he said he said he had he's had something for a little while as well.
Okay, all right. Are you having anything to eat or drink? Have you... I can see you're drinking your coffee but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down?
Um, so it just feels like um the fluids do go down but it just feels like it's going straight through. Just feels like it's going straight through.
Okay. All right. Fine.
When was the last time you had anything solid to eat? Uh which kept which which you kept in?
Um, so I had some... I mean I had some lunch today um but again it just it did just came come out pretty loose.
Okay. All right.
Um, and and Dan, moving forwards, are you otherwise fit and well or do you have any other medical history?
Um, so I um yeah I think I think otherwise I'm fit and well. I um yeah I mean I I'm an okay weight and um I I can't think of any related medical history. Um, I mean like my... yeah, I no I don't think so.
I take it you don't take any regular medications then?
So I um... no I mean I I've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately but I haven't been I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that.
Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
Um, so I don't have any allergies that I know of.
Okay. And what about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems?
Um, bowel? So would would bowel like does is the colon like something...
Yeah. Yeah. So what I mean by bowel is the whole gut really. Anything from the mouth to the anus.
So so my yeah my my dad actually has um colon cancer at the moment.
Oh dear, I'm very sorry to hear that. How is he?
So um from what I heard he's kind of so I don't I don't speak to him that often so I don't I don't know the exact details and I I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer and all of that kind of thing but um he's sort of in his third stage. I I'm not sure what that means exactly. Um, but yeah so yeah it's it's um he's yeah you can I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affected him a lot and um that sort of thing so it's quite I I guess he's um had it for a little while now.
Right, that is... I'm very sorry to hear. I'll make a note of that because uh so it's all important to know these kind of details.
Um, and socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan?
Um, so uh not my brother, he doesn't live with me. I'm I live with my um sister and my mum.
Okay. And uh how are things at home?
Um, I think I mean in in what sense do you mean that?
Just in general day to day life. Are you managing okay? Any particular stresses?
I mean uh I think uh yeah it's been it's been tricky um going to work with all of this. Um, I dislike um taking time off work. I feel like I I just want to go um when I can so I I try and go. Um, I think at at home uh yeah I just haven't really um I I don't normally actually um eat with my family. I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing so I don't think it's affected them and I haven't really been haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mum about it. Um, yeah I just rather deal with these things um so...
What are you mentioning work? You mentioned work. What is it you do for work?
Um, so I work at a I work at um an office um in central London. Um, it's uh so I work in government.
Government. Okay. So office. Okay. Right.
Just a couple last final cou... couple of questions. Uh smoking and alcohol? Do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
Um, so I I smoke um I smoke uh uh for like socially but not like regularly. Um, so normally if if it's a a Friday or something like that I might I might have a cigarette or something like that but um not really.
Sorry?
And the alcohol?
So alcohol um I you know I might have a a beer during the weekdays may uh not that many maybe um one or two but on Fridays I have more um alcohol. Um, yeah uh quite a lot more units. Um, on a I suppose um not every week but maybe uh once or twice a month that yeah I'll I'll go out with my friends and we'll drink a lot so that that's um yeah.
Well thank you for sharing with me. That's very helpful to know. So um Dan, just as a uh conclusion uh um just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis.
Okay.
A bit of a basically an infection of your tummy or if your gut. It's nothing to worry about. I I'm uh I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days just like it did for your brother. Drink... make sure you drink plenty of fluids, okay?
Should I just drink like normal water? I just feel like every time I drink water it's just coming out um.
Clear fluid is probably best but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. Um so you can get things like Dioralyte which is um a fluid replacement which you can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth rec... recommending that.
Okay. Do I need like a prescription for that?
No, no you can just get that over the counter.
Okay.
Um, you can try just, you know, regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so 48 hours, I want you to give me a call back because um, you know, if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations, okay? But I think let's let's see how you are over the next one to two days.
Okay.
And uh we'll catch up soon, okay?
Okay, so you're saying that I should I I could uh I'll try and buy this Dioralyte. What what should I do in terms of um food and that kind of thing? Should I just focus on fluids?
Food dissolve yeah absolutely so clear fluids. You can use soft diet, things like soup, mash, and then gradually build up um as much as your body can tolerate. Um, but really let's try and uh keep yourself well hydrated first, okay?
Okay, is it okay for me to carry on having like um paracetamol and things like that?
Yeah absolutely if you are having if you got a bit of tummy pain if you feeling feverish then I think paracetamol is very sensible.
Okay.
Okay? Try and avoid alcohol if you can.
Uh, okay, I'll try. Yeah.
Okay. All right Dan.
Okay.
Thank you for your help.
All right. Thank you very much. Thanks thanks for helping me out.
Bye bye now.
Okay. Bye.
