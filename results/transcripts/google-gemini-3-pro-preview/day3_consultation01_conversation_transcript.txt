Yes, I think I am, yeah.

Good. Right. You've mentioned in your in your patient notes that you're having some sort of lip swelling and you after you had a sandwich? Is that correct?

Yeah, that is... well, I don't think I don't think it was it wasn't a sandwich but it was it was something with prawns. So basically I I sometimes go with my friends to to this place called... And we we regularly have like usually I have like a normal vegetarian soup or something. And yeah, and then I wanted to try something new. So what happened was I I ordered a prawn soup. It's it's it's called a laksa. It's like a soup. I ordered a prawn one this time. And yeah, and then my feel start... like my lips started feeling a little weird just in the in the corner sort of on the left first. And then I don't know, and then we went back. We had a little bit of a chat, a banter. I wasn't really paying attention. Uh now I feel the that there is a swelling. Yeah. There is like a swelling on my on my upper lip and it's kind of getting bigger. I don't know what to do.

All right. So when did you have the prawn soup? What time?

That was that must have been just after work. So maybe like around 7.

Okay. Around 7 o'clock. And um how long did it take to develop the swelling?

Well, I wasn't really paying attention so it must have been like must have been like I don't know half an hour maybe.

Okay, in half an hour you developed the swelling, yeah?

Yeah.

Okay. And it's getting bigger and bigger.

Yeah, it's it's it's still feel it like really pumping blood in it kind of getting bigger. It feels like it's getting worse.

Okay. So just a few more questions. Um so you mentioned about your swelling of your lips. Is there any feeling of swelling in in your throat? Like your throat is closing up? Any feeling like that?

Yeah, actually I I feel like I can't breathe that well right now.

Okay. And do you feel like like your chest is tight?

I don't know if it's the chest. It just generally feels a little difficult.

Okay.

Yeah, it might be. I'm not sure.

Okay. Right. And just a few... Have you ever had these any kind of lip swelling in the past? After eating any food?

Yeah. Well, maybe. I remember like a year ago. A year ago I was out with my friends. And I think we went like to a late night kind of Chinese place. And I remember that I was quite drunk to be honest. And I remember that after like having that very late I woke up the next morning quite swollen up and had also like felt really bad and quite difficult breathing. But I'm not sure what it was I had. It was like a curry or something.

Okay. Uh and what did you take at that time? Did you use anything like antihistamine or anything when you had that last time?

Well I generally have asthma so I take I take uh what's that called? Salbutamol inhalers?

Yeah.

Yeah. So I do take that regularly but I've always taken it. I generally have asthma.

And any other inhalers? Is it just the Salbutamol that you use? Any other brown inhalers?

Uh... No. No, I don't think so. No.

Okay. Right. And um so do you use antihistamines like Cetirizine, Loratadine, Piriton, any of those kind of things?

Mm no. I... well no I do sometimes but I don't know which ones. So I have a peanut allergy as well. Like I've always had it. And I think I do get antihistamines for that but I'm not sure which ones.

And any point because you've had peanut allergy, any time you had to ever use like an injection?

When I was a kid I think I remember my mom told me about it. But I don't know what it was cause I was small and I changed doctors since.

Right. Has your mom ever said that you had to go to hospital because you had an severe allergic reaction?

Yeah. As... well I was like six or something. I I I think... Oh the swelling is getting... oh... oh yeah. I think when I was six.

Right. Are you okay now?

Oh I feel a little dizzy right now to be honest.

You feel dizzy. Okay. Right. Do you have any kind of uh antihistamines with you at the moment?

No. I don't think I have. No.

Okay. Right. Okay. So... Right. All right. I I am really a bit worried about you at the moment Maria. It um I think we need to call an ambulance because um from what history you've been telling me it sounds like you could be going into what we say an an anaphylactic reaction. That's when your throat and your chest you know closes in. And you might need an injection like what your mom's um you know what your mom told you as you were a young child. Okay. Right. So is there any anyone with you at the moment or are you alone?

I'm alone at the moment. Yeah.

Okay. So hang on the line while I'll call the ambulance, okay? And I'll send them right to you. Okay? And...

Oh somebody just came. Somebody just came. Yes. I'm not alone anymore.

All right. Okay. Somebody just came. So just call the ambulance. Make sure that person's with you till the ambulance comes. Yeah? Uh and because we are worried about an anaphylactic reaction. So you need to go straight away. Could you ask the person whether they have any antihistamines around in the interim? While we're waiting.

Yes. Uh Mom, Mom do we have any antihistamines around?

Yes.

Oh yeah we do.

Take that straight away and if Mom can call, Mom if you can call the 999 999, yeah? And say that you're there is a suspected anaphylactic reaction and they need to come straight away. Okay?

Yes, she says she will. Yes. Yes.

All right. So straight away take the antihistamines in the meantime. All right.

Okay. Okay. Yes. Thank you.

And after you come out from the hospital do give us a ring back. We might need to sort you out um with your injections and things like that. Okay?

Yes. Yes. Will do. Yes. Thank you.

All right. Okay then. Take care.

Thank you very much. Bye bye.

Bye.
