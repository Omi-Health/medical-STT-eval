Hi.

Hi.

Hi, how are you?

Uh, yeah, I'm all right thanks. Um, although I'm actually feeling a little bit uh wheezy.

Okay. My name's Dr. Goher. I'm one of the GPs that works with Babylon. Can I confirm your name and date of birth, please?

Uh, yeah. My my name is um uh Tina Smith. And I'm 40 years old.

Okay. And are you in a space that's quiet and private?

Uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm just um in my room.

And you mentioned that you're wheezy.

Mhm.

Can you tell me a little bit more about that?

Yeah, so um it started like about two days ago. Um, I don't know if it's because, you know, I was like cleaning the house and like um all this dust came out of the the carpet and you know, I've always sort of thought that maybe I've got a an allergy to like dust um or something. So, don't know if it was triggered by that. Um, you know, two days later, still not gone any better so um just getting a little bit worried about it now.

Okay. So you were cleaning the house two days ago and that's when it first started?

Uh, yeah, that's right.

Did the wheezing start suddenly or was it gradual?

Uh, so it started after maybe uh an hour or so.

And has it got worse over the past two days?

Yeah, so it gets a bit worse um at night I find.

Okay. And have you taken anything for the wheeze?

Uh, no, no I haven't actually.

Okay. So and the wheeze has been getting worse and today you're particularly worried, is it because you're finding it hard to breathe or finding it hard to talk?

Yeah, yeah a bit of both actually. So um I'm feeling like a little bit uh short of breath.

Okay.

Um and actually when I'm, you know, talking um to my friends and stuff finding that uh sometimes um I'm unable to com- complete my sentences. Um it can it can get really bad, yeah.

And when you can breathe and you take a deep breath, do you notice any pain?

Um... hmm no. No. No pain.

And have you noticed yourself feeling dizzy or the room spinning more than normal?

Uh, no, no dizziness. Um none of that.

And have you been eating and drinking okay, particularly water?

Yeah, yeah, I think I'm having like, you know, four or five glasses a day, yeah.

Okay. And are you normally fit and well, or do you have any other medical problems?

Um, well actually uh I used to have like a bit of um asthma uh as a child. Um and also in the summer I sometimes get um hay fever.

And when you get hay fever do you take medications for it?

Uh... not really.

Okay. And your asthma, did it resolve when you were a child?

Uh... I think mostly, yeah. I mean sometimes when I um run for like long periods it can it can start up a bit, but um I have a... I have like an asthma inhaler I use for that.

Okay, so do you still have your inhalers?

Um, I think I might have one from like a couple of months ago.

Okay. But you don't see your doctor regularly for asthma.

No, I don't.

Okay. And apart from this, do you know if you're allergic to anything?

Uh, not that I know of.

Okay. And how far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment?

Sorry, could you repeat that?

How far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment?

Uh... I'd say maybe five minutes drive away.

Okay good. So, given that you've had a history of asthma when you were a child... and you get hay fever sometimes in the summer... your shortness of breath...

Hi, I've lost um video signal. Can you still hear me?

Um, yeah, we've just turned off.

Perfect. So given you've got a history of asthma and hay fever, this could be one of two things. But we want to rule out asthma or an allergy first. So what you would need to do is visit one of our clinics so we can do some more tests.

Okay. What what sort of...

So the first thing we would do is use a small device on your finger to check the amount of oxygen in your blood.

Okay.

And from that we can tell if it's asthma or something else.

Right. Okay.

Before this happens, if you've got something like an anti- antihistamine which you normally take for hay fever at home, I would take one just in case it is an allergy you've had from the dust.

Oh okay. Uh yeah I don't have any antihistamines at home unfortunately.

You might be able to get one on your way to the doctor's surgery, if not they can prescribe you one.

Okay. Okay so I can just get it over the counter then?

Yes. And they're normally about four to six pounds.

Great.

Is there anything else that you're particularly worried about or want to ask me?

Um, um not really. I mean... I have before taken steroids for asthma. Um I don't know if that's relevant.

Yes that is and you may need to take some steroids now but we cannot we won't be able to know until we've done those tests first.

Okay. Okay.

Cool. So I'm gonna write a letter for your GP just to let him know what's happened. And the consultation with the GP in person shouldn't take too long.

All right. How long do you think it will take?

Probably 10 minutes.

Okay. That's great.

Cool. And you should get the letter over the app and then we can you can take yourself to the GP.

All right.

Cool.

Thank you very much.

Bye.

Okay. Thank you. Bye bye.
