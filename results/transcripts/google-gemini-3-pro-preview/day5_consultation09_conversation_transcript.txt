Hello.

Hi there, it's Dr. Smith from Babylon.

Um, it's 1 Babylon Avenue.

And are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today?

Yes.

What can I do for you?

Um, coming... I don't really know what's been going on but just aching all over for... definitely the last six weeks, it might have been slightly longer than that, but it's just sort of that feeling really tired, run down.

Okay. Um, so when, when do you think you were last well?

Uh, where are we now? Just started April. Definitely Christmas, New Year, I felt relatively well I think. Um, so since then. Actually yeah, I, I was on holiday in um, in the States and yeah, probably coincided with sometime around then, end of January, start of Feb.

So do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back?

Uh, probably a couple of weeks after I got back.

And were you well when you were on holiday?

Yeah, had a, had a great time, very active.

Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhea, vomiting, anything like that?

Um, no, not that I recall. Um, yeah, not, no, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards.

Okay. So just tell me what symptoms you've been having. In terms of just your general health, any persistent cold symptoms or ear ache, sore throat, chest, che... cough, shortness of breath, phlegm, anything like that?

Uh, no.

Any change in your weight at all?

Um, I don't think so. Like I'm probably less hungry but no, no weight change, just a bit.

And are you eating different amounts?

Uh, yeah, probably slightly smaller portions or it, yeah, more of an effort to, to actually eat everything that's in front of me.

Any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat or abdominal pain?

No.

Any change in your bowel habit, diarrhea, vomiting or blood in the stool?

Uh, no.

Any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine?

No, that's all fine.

Okay. And any other general symptoms like rashes?

Um, I don't have any rashes now. There was uh, in fact I've got a photo um, on my phone if, if that's helpful.

Okay.

Let me show you, hang on. Um, cause this, yeah this was weird, this sort of came up and then uh, disappeared after a couple of weeks. Uh, where's the light? I don't know if that... can you see that?

Yeah, whereabouts was it?

Uh, I think sort of calf, back of my calf. Uh cause I didn't notice it, my wife noticed it actually.

And when did you first notice it?

Um, probably uh, around the end of February? Sort of middle to end of Feb and then it... like it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time and I... it faded over a couple of weeks I guess.

Did you have any fevers at that time?

Um, I... to be honest that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat I had um, so possibly a little bit feverish but I, I sort of put it down to that.

Okay. Do you know where you got that when it started? Had you been walking, did you get any bites that you noticed?

Uh, I defi... like I do quite a lot of walking and we did um quite a lot while we were out in the... on holiday as well but definitely um, yeah. I, I don't recall any bites, I don't remember seeing anything bitten but you often like, yeah as you're walking through, I was in shorts and, and boots but...

Okay.

...feel the odd bit.

And whereabouts were you in the States?

Um, just sort of uh, near Yosemite so...

Okay. And any headaches, blurred vision, tingling, numbness?

Um, no. Like sort of headache maybe in with just generally feeling a bit crappy? Or... yeah no, that's better.

And have you been able to go to work as usual?

Um, I've been going to work. I don't know how effective it's been but yeah I've been...

And what's your job?

Um, I work for a health technology company actually.

Okay. And has your concentration been affected or your tiredness levels in the daytime at work?

Yeah definitely sort of tired and um, yeah less energy sort of, probably less engaged than I, I would normally be.

Have you been able to exercise okay?

Um, not as much. Uh I don't know if it's I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it. I'm not exercising as much as I would normally.

Okay. Right. And um, how's your mental health, your stress levels?

Uh, pretty good at the moment actually. Like it, previously that has been an issue but um, other than sort of physically feeling a bit uh, crappy, I've yeah, been in a pretty good place.

Okay. Apart from that rash, any other rashes on your skin or swelling of your joints or pain in your joints?

Uh, yeah sort of aching shoulders, back, hips, knees but sort of... yeah not...

Any swelling that you've noticed?

No.

Or hands, wrists, ankles, toes?

Uh, no.

Okay. Um, and any other significant medical problems in the past?

Uh, I mean, hay fever, does that count?

Pardon?

Asthma and hay fever if they count?

Okay. Any flare ups of your asthma recently?

Uh, no, it's pretty well controlled.

Do you take any regular inhalers or other medication?

Uh yeah, I've got one of those um, preventers I think they... yeah, um which I take twice a day. But I've not used my salbutamol not...

You haven't been using it?

So I have... I've been using the every day, sort of morning and night, but not the uh, blue one, not the reliever.

Okay. And any um, do you take any other medications?

Um, so just the uh I take um, one of the antihistamines, the... it might be cetirizine? Cetirizine can I get that from... just from the pharmacy.

Yeah, that's fine. Um and do you smoke?

No.

Drink any alcohol?

Uh, occasionally.

No?

Sorry, occasionally, that was...

Okay. And who do you live with at home?

Uh, just my wife.

Um, sorry. Um, so with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms which have been ongoing for six weeks, that's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels. Um, I think it's important to get some blood tests checking all the normal things like liver, kidneys, blood counts et cetera, but also some more specific things like um, a bacterial infection you can sometimes get uh, including one that you can get which can produce a rash like that. So that would involve blood tests, are you happy to do that?

Uh, yeah I'm, I'm gen... general happy with blood tests. What's the infection?

Well you can get uh, you can get bacterial infection caused which is called um, which is just called Lyme disease that you can get a rash like that from a tick bite. So that's something we would do a test for as well.

Okay.

And if that comes back positive then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it. So it's definitely worth checking for but we would also check just for other things um, which can cause reduced energy tiredness and aching for persistent over six weeks.

Okay.

So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line and then when you've had the test arrange a follow up about a week after, after you've had the test done.

Okay. So do the test first and then... and that follow up we can just do over the phone again? Or...

Yeah, yeah we can do that over the phone to start with.

Excellent.

Okay?

No, that's really helpful. Thank you very much.

Any other questions?

Oh, sorry, you broke up a bit there.

Any other questions?

Oh, no, not, no.

Okay, that's great. Take care.

Take care. Thank you. Bye.

Sorry.
