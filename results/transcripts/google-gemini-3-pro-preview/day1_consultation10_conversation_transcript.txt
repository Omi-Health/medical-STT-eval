Hello?

Hi.

Can you hear me okay?

Yeah, I can hear you. Hi.

Right, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age please?

Sure. Um, I'm Manda Jackson and I'm 19 years old.

19 years old. Okay, Amanda. And how can I help you this afternoon?

Um, so it's been going on for a few days now. Um, it's not happened before and I'm a bit worried. It's quite—it hurts when I kind of pee. Um, and yeah, it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more. Um, and it's really like I can't like go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet.

Oh dear.

Um, and it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in at the bottom of my tummy as well.

Right, okay. I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you. Um, so you mentioned it's been going on for the last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. Um, you said you go to the toilet more often as well. Is that right?

Uh, yeah. It's been going on for a little bit longer than three days I think actually. Maybe just under a week.

Oh under a week, sorry.

Okay.

Sorry, no, I didn't explain it properly before. Um, yeah. No, I—it's been going on for about just under a week. Um, and yeah, I've noticed sort of burning, stinging when I when I go to the toilet. Yeah.

Have you noticed any anything in your urine, for example, any blood or um discoloration of urine?

Um, I think, well, today I noticed um that it was like a bit pink. The the the urine.

Okay. Yeah. I think just today.

Have you noticed any any kind of frank blood? I mean red blood at all in your urine?

Um, I think it was mixed in probably. I don't know, it was pink, so.

Okay. Um, fine. We'll we'll have to definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on. Um, you also mentioned some tummy pain as well. Can you tell me a bit more about that pain?

Yeah, it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy. Um, mainly when I go to the loo. I think that's when it's worse.

Okay. Um, can you describe—is it a crampy pain, is it more of a burning pain?

Um, I wouldn't describe it as crampy. I don't think it's like a period pain. It's a bit different. It's hard to say. An achy pain I suppose.

Achy pain. Okay. And does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back, towards your sides?

No. No, no.

Okay. All right. Um, any other symptoms at all? Like for example nausea, vomiting?

No. No nausea or vomiting.

Okay. Any temperatures or fevers?

Um, no. No, not that I've noticed.

Okay. All right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working okay?

Uh, I I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway. So I don't think it's any different.

Okay. When you say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have?

Um, I think I have um IBS. Um, so I just kind of pass my bowels like quite quite a lot. Um, and sometimes it's quite it's quite variable. Like sometimes it's a bit softer. Sometimes it's a bit—sorry, this is a bit disgusting, but like sometimes it's a bit harder and it's kind of hard to predict.

Okay. All right. But no no no new symptoms in your bowels.

No, no, not that I've noticed. No.

All right. Um, and Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions as you can imagine. Um, uh can I ask are you currently uh are you currently sexually active at the moment?

Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah. Um, I have uh a long-term um boyfriend.

Okay. And um have you noticed any other discharge from down below? So from from the front passage?

Mm, not—no, I don't think so. Nothing unusual.

Okay. Have you—do you use any form of contraception?

Uh, yeah. Uh, I'm um on the pill.

On the pill. What kind of pill is it? Is it the combined pill or the mini pill?

Uh, combined pill.

Okay. Fine. Um, when was the last time you had um unprotected sex? If you don't mind me asking.

Uh, uh, I mean I mean unprotected as in like no no condoms or anything?

Yeah, exactly.

Um, I guess 'cause I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend. Just like, I don't know, we've just kind of agreed. Uh, so um I guess a week ago. Two weeks ago maybe.

Okay. All right. I guess what I'm trying to get at is whether um uh there's any chance you could be pregnant at all. Uh I know you're on the pill, but uh we we nonetheless we do have to ask. Um, when was your last when was your last period?

Um, two weeks ago?

Two weeks ago. Okay. All right. Just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms aren't getting any better, okay? Um, fine. In terms of your general health otherwise at the moment, are you uh eating and drinking okay?

Uh, yeah. Yeah, eating and drinking okay. Um, I did have one kind of concern. I don't know. So I smoked uh—this is quite bad—but I smoked weed for the first time like a week and a half ago. And I I just wondered whether it's related at all. Probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you.

Sure. Well thanks for sharing with me. Um, so I I don't think it's is related to your symptoms. I think it's probably just a pure pure coincidence. Um, but uh, you know, I do strongly advise you to, you know, um make it a regular habit if you can. Um, just for your just for your general health moving forwards. Okay?

Okay.

Um, fine. Moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions actually? Apart from the IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of?

No. No.

No. Okay. Great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis? Apart from the um combined pill.

Apart from the pill, um I take um something for the IBS as well. Um, it begins with an M. It's really hard to pronounce. Like Mebe-something.

Mebeverine is it? Yeah. Okay.

Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

Okay. And is that for the cramps, the crampy pain?

Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications?

Um, yeah. I think there was an antibiotic um called Clindas—Clindamycin? Mycin? That I took like a couple of years ago for something and yeah, that that didn't go too well with me.

Right. Okay. Sure. I'll make a note of that. Um, in terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys?

No. No.

No. Or generally anything else? Good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you?

Um, so I am living in halls at the moment. Uh, at uni. Um, so uh I'm just living with a flatmate I suppose. Um, but my family live kind of outside of London, not too far away. Um, so yeah, my family are fine and I see them now and then. Yeah, things I think I think they're okay generally.

Very good. Great. And what are you studying at university?

I'm studying uh English.

English. Okay. Good. And how you enjoying your course?

Yeah, yeah. It's it's going well, thanks. Just kind of started uh a few months ago a few months ago and yeah, I really enjoy it.

Very good. Good. Um, in terms of smoking and alcohol, do you do participate in either?

Uh, as I admitted before, I tried weed the first time. Uh, but I don't smoke. Uh, I drink occasionally um kind of socially um with friends and stuff.

Okay. What what made you have your first joint last week? Was it...

Um, I it was just a party. Um, there was other people doing it. Um, I kind of was a little bit tipsy so probably wasn't thinking quite straight. Um, but yeah, I I completely agree. It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis.

Sure. And obviously as your doctor I'm here to look after you so I I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid it if you can.

Sure.

Great. Um, fine. So at this stage I would normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think um, you know, I'm reassured by the fact that I I think it's um probably just a simple what we say UTI or a cystitis, bladder infection. Um, you know, you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about. So things like fevers and back pain um would be more worrying for me to hear. Um, so something we we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. Um, so we've got a choice of two antibiotics, something called Trimethoprim or Nitrofurantoin, which is a three day course. And normally they're usually quite effective um for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample today as well if you can so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there. Um, start the antibiotics. Make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids. Um, if you are having some pain, simple paracetamol um would probably be advisable. Um, we'll see what the urine sample shows. Um, and if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. Um, but if things are still not getting any better next week, come back and see me. And we can have another look again.

Okay. Okay. Uh great. Um, with with the urine sample, um how do I go about doing that? Do I do it through the app?

So I'll give you— uh, no. Uh well, good question. So I will give you—I will organize uh for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices um which we can test there and then with a urine dip and send it off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results.

Okay. Perfect.

Okay?

Great.

Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call, okay?

Fever, back pain, vomiting. Great. Okay. Yeah. I'll check for those.

Okay. Have a good day.

Okay. Great. Thank you. You too. Have a good day. Bye bye.
