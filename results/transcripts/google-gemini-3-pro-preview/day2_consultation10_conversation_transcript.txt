Hello, good afternoon.

Hi-ya.

Hi there, this is Dr. Dinmez from GP at Hand.

Hi there, my name's Airton.

Hi Airton. So, could I have your, um... before we start, could I have your full name and date of birth if that's possible?

Sure, so it's Airton Warren, and my date of birth is the 16th of May, 1982.

That's great, thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak?

I am, yes.

Okay, great. So how can I help you today?

Um, so I kind of woke up this morning, um, and I've just got this really horrible pain on the left side of my head. Um, a real kind of headachey feeling.

Sure, okay. And um... uh... is... did the... did the pain wake you up?

Yeah, it woke me up um quite early this morning.

What time did it wake you up?

Um, probably around 5:30-ish.

And what time do you normally get up?

Um, I normally get up at about 7 o'clock.

Is the headache still present now?

Yes, it is.

Okay. Have you had this kind of pain before?

Um, I mean I've had a bit of a history with headaches, but nothing as severe as this before.

So they were less severe. Were they similar in nature in terms of being one-sided and the type of pain?

Um, not so much on the one side, it tends to be a bit of a cluster at the front of my head in a way. Um, but this time it's just kind of more prominent on the left side, which I've never really had. It... normally they kind of spread across the front of my head.

Okay, alright. And um... can I just double check, do you have any neck stiffness at all?

Uh, no.

Okay. And do you have any fever?

No.

Alright. Um, how are you with bright lights at the moment? Do you feel sensitive to bright lights or can you... can you tolerate them alright, okay?

Um... I'm a little bit sensitive. It just... it kind of makes my eyes a little bit sore, but nothing that I can't really handle.

Okay. And can I just double check... are you feeling nauseous at all?

Um, not really. Like, when I first got up this morning my head felt a bit dizzy, but that's kind of subsided now and I... seems to be fine.

Okay. Um, and um, can I just double check, does anyone in your family have any migraines or anything like that... have they been diagnosed with migraines?

Uh, no, they haven't.

Okay. Um, and um, are you under any particular stress at the moment?

Um... work's kind of um... a bit stressful at the moment. I've got a lot going on. Um... yeah, I just seem to have like a lot of kind of... a backlog of work that I need to go through at the moment. So I've kind of been doing a lot of late nights as well.

Right, okay. Um, and um, how long has that been the case for?

Uh, probably about a couple of months now.

How would you say your mood is?

Um... I'm not like moody, I'm not angry or um, like I get a bit frustrated during the day, um but... it kind of um ebbs and flows every now and then, but yeah.

Okay. Do you have... have you ever been diag... diagnosed with anxiety or depression or stress in the past?

Um, I've had um... so I had like anxiety for about two years now, and I've been on uh Sertraline for a while.

Okay. Are you taking the Sertraline at the moment?

Yes.

Okay. Um, and how do you feel in terms of anxiety at the moment? Do you feel anxious at the moment?

No, not necessarily. At work sometimes I do feel a bit anxious. Um... I... I kind of just... the panic of not being able to get my work done on time. Um, but other than that I... I don't feel um massively anxious.

Okay. All right. Um, now, sorry to ask this, I just need to ask this for anyone suffering from anxiety, do you have... have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself?

No.

Good, glad to hear that. Um, now with regards to this headache, is it worse when you lie down or um... is... does... is it better when you lie down?

Um, when I lay down, like uh... it kind of feels a little bit sore at first, um and it takes me a while to get comfortable. Um, so yeah at the beginning it does, but then again that just kind of um soothes a little bit.

Okay. Um, so would you say ultimately it's better when you lie down?

Yeah, I would say so.

Okay. Um, and um, in terms of um... this headache since this morning, have you taken anything for it yet?

Um, I've taken some Paracetamol.

Does that help?

Um, not really, no.

Okay. Taken anything else at all?

No, that's it. Just Paracetamol.

Okay. Um, do you have any other illnesses at all?

Uh, none.

Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure?

No.

Have you ever had your blood pressure checked?

No.

Okay. Um, and are there any illnesses in your family?

Um, no. There's nothing. My parents... uh my Mum's had a history of anxiety as well, but no kind of like physical illnesses or anything like that.

Okay. All right. And um... are you on any medication?

Um, no. Other... other than Sertraline and having taken um Paracetamol this morning, um nothing else.

Do you have any allergies to any medication?

Not that I'm aware of, no.

All right. And are you living by yourself at the moment, or are you living with someone else?

Um, I live with my partner.

Okay. Are you a smoker?

No.

Okay. And uh do you have any pets at home?

Uh, I have a cat.

Okay. And can I just double check, how much exercise would you do normally a week?

Um, so normally I try to go running at least three times a week.

Okay. And what's your diet like?

Um, it's okay. Um, it's nothing... nothing um really healthy, um but it... it's fine. Okay. I wouldn't say it's unhealthy.

All right. Um, now um, in terms of this headache, uh obviously I haven't been able to examine you or see you directly, but um it sounds like it might be one of two things. It could be an element of what we call tension headache.

Okay.

That's one possibility. Um, and what makes that more likely is the fact that you've been under some pressure and you've got... have a history of anxiety in the past, okay? Um, the other possibility is um migraine as well.

Okay.

Um, and the fact... what makes that more likely is the fact that it's on one side and that you've got some sensitivity to light. Okay. So what... what I think we can do is um, I think we can give you some um generic pain relief that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches. Okay? So I'll tell you what that is in a second. And the other thing that I was going to suggest is we maybe look... explore things to try and decrease the stress from work. So...

Okay.

Um, the medication wise, the things that we'd start off first line if someone had migraine was to... would be to start Ibuprofen, and um...

Okay.

...that... the dosage of Ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal dosage of Ibuprofen. So that's one thing we can start. You can keep on taking Paracetamol as well if you like, but that... the Ibuprofen is um actually more effective for... for migraine.

Oh, right, okay.

And...

Um yeah so the guidelines have changed. Recently we... we... before that we used to give Paracetamol as first line, but now it's um Ibuprofen or Aspirin. That's the first thing. Um, the other thing I'd like you to do is maybe consider taking some time off work. Okay? Because if the stress is due to stress from work, um maybe having a week off if you self-certify, that might help with things. And I'd also like you to explore counseling options as well. So there's a counseling service in your area that I can give you the link for for you to self-refer.

Yeah, that would be...

Okay, like to try that. Um, what we're going to do is we'll have a follow-up in a week's time. As well as those two things, other things I'd like you to do is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of seven, eight hours sleep at night, every night.

Okay.

Drinking a minimum of um 1.5 to 2 liters of... of water or fluids a day. And that's not including coffee or tea.

Okay.

All right? Because sometimes dehydration and, you know, fatigue can be causes of headaches as well.

Oh okay, I didn't realize that.

Yeah, so that... that is um, you know, we need to rule those things out. Um, let's... let's try that, okay? Um, and let's have a follow-up appointment. If we're finding that things are not getting better, we might need to arrange some blood tests or um look at uh other possibilities. But we'll try that in the first instance. Um, if anything changes in the meantime or you get worried or things get worse, feel free, have a low threshold for ringing us back and booking an appointment and we can reassess the situation.

Okay. Yeah, no, that... that sounds brilliant. Thank you so much for your help.

No problem. Okay. So there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes, um and I'll also leave a link to some of the danger signs and symptoms of headaches in the notes. If you can read through that in your own time, that will just help you to have a bit more control over what's going on and understanding of what kind of things should trigger you contacting another doctor.

Okay, that's perfect. Thank you so much for your help.

No problem. Okay. So we'll... we'll touch base in a week's time with me or myself or one of the other doctors, and we can... we'll take it from there, okay?

Okay. Thank you. Yeah, I'll book an appointment and um, yeah, in that time.

Brilliant. Okay then. All right. Take care then. All the best.

Thank you, and you.

Bye bye.

Bye.
