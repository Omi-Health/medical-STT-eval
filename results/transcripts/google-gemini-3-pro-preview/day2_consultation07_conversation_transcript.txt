Right. Okay. Now do you have those these symptoms right now or have they gone off now?

Um no they're still present.

Okay. So you've still got the chest discomfort right now?

Yes.

Okay. Um we're probably going to have to call an ambulance for you to take you to hospital, okay? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to task my colleague next to me to sort that out. While we do that, I'm going to ask you a few more questions, okay? Just give a bit more information to the the the ambulance team when they when they arrive, okay?

Sure.

So just just to double check, um where exactly in the chest is the pain?

Um it's in the uh middle of my chest um over uh yeah my my pecs so um yeah but not not necessarily to one side. Um and it's quite a diffuse pain.

Right. Is it spreading anywhere else like down to your arm up to the jaw in the neck anything like that?

Yeah it's it's um mainly in my left arm uh it's feeling a little bit um uh painful and and in my shoulder as well.

Have you had this before?

No this is the first time actually.

Right. Okay. Okay um are you aware of any palpitations like your heart beating faster or more prominently than normal?

Um yeah it's it's beating a bit faster now. I think that's because I'm a little bit stressed um about the situation but I haven't noticed it um beating faster than usual um uh today.

So I I know you're stressed. We've got an ambulance coming on the way, okay? So um we'll take care of everything. So don't don't worry. Is anyone in the house with you at the moment?

Okay. Yeah.

So ambulance team will be with you very shortly. I'm going to stay on the line with you until they come okay?

Yeah uh it's an allergic reaction so I swell up um a bit but um nothing life threatening. Um I've I sometimes even have it and it's it's it's a mild reaction to it.

Okay. All right. It's very important that you communicate that to the hospital

Okay.

that detail you've just told me because um we we may need to consider aspirin despite allergy okay?

Oh okay.

All right. Um now in terms of um what happens from here the ambulance team will assess you and then they may take you in to one hospital or another based on how bad what the ECG looks like and what kind of treatment you might need okay?

Okay.

What I'm going to do is we'll stay on the line for the time being.
