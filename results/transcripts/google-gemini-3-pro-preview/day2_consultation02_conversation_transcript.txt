Hi there, good morning.

Hello, good morning.

I'm Dr. Dean Mirza from GP at Hand. Nice to see you.

Nice to see you.

Before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth?

Yes. My name is John Smith and I was born on the 5th of April 1973.

Okay, that's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely?

Yes, absolutely.

Okay, great. Okay. So, um, tell me a bit about what's been happening. You said you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow.

Yeah, um, I just noticed this like about a week ago or something. Um, have like a weird swelling on on on my elbow. I noticed that when I was in the shower. Um, it's not painful at all or like I I feel fine but it's just it's just a bit a bit weird to see that. Um, it's it's slightly warm. Um, and I I kind of feel like there's it's a bit fluid in inside or um... Sure. Sure. So I I would like to know what's going on basically.

And so, did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow?

Um, it's the the left elbow.

Left elbow. Okay. And have you banged that elbow? Did you have any kind of injury?

No, not really. Um, not that I know of. I haven't noticed anything. I can actually like move a bit normally. Um, it's just I I can just see that it feels a bit strange.

Sure, okay. And um, in terms of your job, do you do anything physical?

Not really, no. I just, you know, sit at a desk. Um.

Right. Okay. And um has this happened before?

No, no, I haven't noticed that before. Um, I don't have any like history of of seeing this. I don't remember at at all.

Sure, okay. And can I um, can I just double check, has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that?

Um, oh well, I I do well, I think I think I have something like osteoarthritis. Um, uh uh it sometimes kind of hurts my joints, but uh in my family I'm not sure.

Okay.

I don't know, no.

Sure. So you you said you think you've got osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis?

Um, yes. Yes, a few years ago.

Okay. Was that a GP or a specialist or was it a physiotherapist?

Uh, a GP. Um, yeah.

GP. Okay. All right. Um, right, can I just uh sorry, can I just double check how old you are please?

I'm 53.

53. Okay, fantastic. All right. Um, and do you have any other illnesses at all?

Um... well, not not really, no. Um, feel pretty good. I'm I'm allergic to to peanuts. Um but...

Right. Okay.

...that's that's pretty much all I uh have to say about my medical history, yeah.

Okay. Are you allergic to any medication?

Uh, no. Not that I know of.

Sure. And um, do you um are you on any medication on a regular basis?

Uh, no.

No. Okay. And are you normally fit and well? Mobile, active?

I do I do uh do some sports. I run regularly like two, three times a week. Um, yeah, no, I'm I think I'm healthy.

Okay good, good. Well done. That's good good that you're doing that on a regular basis. Okay. Um, and um, uh, can I is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now?

Uh, yeah, sure.

Okay, bear with me one second. Right, okay. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that, a bit higher so I can just see the underside. Okay, fantastic. All right. And then just bring it round to this side, centrally, I can see the other side. Okay, fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers. Does is it is it hot compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin?

It's a bit warm, yes.

It's a bit warmer. Okay. Um, and um, is it very tender when you're pressing on that now? Does if you give it a press, does it hurt you at all?

On the on the tip of the elbow it's it's okay. It's just like next to it like where the the swelling is, it's a bit, yeah it feels a bit fluid.

Okay. All right. Um, what um, I noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow. Do do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body?

Uh no, not really I have normal skin. Yeah pretty dry no.

Do you suffer from eczema at all?

No.

No. All right. Okay. So um, what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem, okay, is um I think it would be worthwhile... this seems like uh what we call a bursitis, okay. So that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. Um, what I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication in the first instance. And as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of um causes of joint swelling. Okay? So um what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some um blood test forms to be sent out to your house. And there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done. And that will involve you um having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies, and so we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well. Okay?

Okay.

The time frame for that will be um... the results will come back to us after about five, six days um from now. So it will take some time for the forms to come out to you. And then if you get the forms done, tests done straight away, by the time that we're expecting a result back, you know, one or two days after that, we're looking at maybe six days. And what I'd suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood tests, and we can um get a gauge as to uh what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now, it doesn't look like to me like something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So we worry sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint. Um, and your your joint doesn't look like that. However, if your the elbow was to become very red, very painful, uh and the redness was to spread or become, you know, more intense, then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible because that would be an emergency. That would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment. Okay?

Do do you think it's something dangerous like something like could I die from that or is it is it...

No. I I don't think this is anything dangerous. Don't need to worry. Okay. What I'm doing is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to to develop. Okay? So if things were to worsen... this this is not the case right now. Right now it looks quite straightforward. Nothing's sinister or life threatening. Um, what I'm doing is I'm just saying in case things worsen, these are the things that we'll be looking out for and this is what you have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully. And I don't think you're going to have it. But I'm just saying the what if scenario. Is that okay?

Yeah, that that sounds good. Thank you.

All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me?

Um, well, just yeah I really I just wanted to know about this. Um, yeah, it feels a bit better now to know that.

Okay, all right.

Yeah, no that's it. Thank you.

Okay. So I I would take Ibuprofen regularly, okay. You can get that over the counter. Um, that's 400 milligrams three times a day. And you should take take that after food, not on an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn stop taking it, okay?

Sure.

All right. So what I want to do is I'll get the forms sent out to you and um we are going to arrange a follow-up appointment maybe within a um... Actually you know, the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face to face. If it's more convenient for you to do to do it over the phone, we can do that over the phone or over video, we can do that as well. That's that's your call. But you contact us after you've had the blood tests done and we can review things then, okay?

Okay, yeah that sounds good. I I'll do that and if I see that it's getting worse I'll probably ask for a physical appointment but...

Sure. Sure, that's a good idea. All right then. Okay. Um, take care then. So I'll just leave that with me. I'll sort all those bits and pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll we'll um review you after the tests if things go well. Okay?

All right. Thank you very much.

All right then. Take care then. All the best. Bye bye.

Bye.
