Hi, good morning.

Hello there.

Hi there this is Dr. Gin Mezza from GP at Hand.

Hello there. Um I'm wondering if you can help me today?

Okay sure I'll I'll try. Um before we start, could I please confirm your um full name and date of birth?

Yes, it's Sarah Smith and it's the 2nd of November um 1992.

That's great. Thank you Sarah. So are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment?

I am indeed, yes.

Okay. So tell me what's been going on?

Okay, I've I've really not been feeling so well at all recently. I I've been struggling with fever for the past week. Yeah, I would say it started about seven days ago. I'm just am really hot and sweaty all the time and just generally not feeling good.

Okay, all right. Sorry to hear that. Now um along with this fever and this feeling hot and sweaty, any other symptoms at all?

Um, I'd say that I'm aching all over really. My muscles are really aching. Um feeling quite nauseous. Uh so I've not been able to eat very much and I have been drinking but it's been quite a small amount. Um yeah just generally quite tired and unwell. I'm sweating during the the the night. Not quite cold.

Okay, all right. Um and um so you you're having periods of when you're feeling hot and also periods when you're feeling cold as well.

Yes, yeah it's quite interchangeable. Not really a pattern to it.

Okay. Uh and have you been taking any medication?

Uh, I've been trying to like take ibuprofen and paracetamol just from over the counter but it's not really helping. Just been taking the recommended dose every day of those.

Sure. And when you say it's not helping, is it bringing the temperature down at all?

Perhaps slightly, yes, but I'm still experiencing these symptoms so it it does take the edge off of it.

Okay, all right. And can I just double check have you got any cough or cold or sore throat runny nose anything like that?

Mm, not those sort of symptoms really.

Which symptoms are you getting other than the ones you've already mentioned to me?

Um so I have I have a but it's mainly just the sweating really and the and the nausea uh that's overtaking all day and the the aching muscles all over.

Sure. Have have you had any ear pain at all?

Mm, no my ears are fine actually. I haven't had any problems with my ears.

Okay. Um just I just need to check for any other causes of infection in the body. So I'm gonna go through some um kind of systemic questions. Have you had any diarrhea?

Uh n- not not really, no. No I've been fine.

Okay. Have you got any neck stiffness at all?

Um, no.

Okay.

Neck's neck's been fine.

All right. Um do you have any headache?

Not more than usual no. Just like the general headaches but not just from staring at the screen no migraines or anything.

Okay. So you know your normal headache, where is that? In the back of the head or the front of the head?

Um, it's quite centralized over over the head.

Okay. And how long you been having that for?

It's something that I've struggled with for years really just related to screen use or um like changes in weather patterns. Yeah high pressure days sometimes I struggle with migraines and headaches.

Okay. Um have you got any rash on your body anywhere at all?

Uh, I haven't noticed any rashes, no.

Are any joints swollen or tender or sore?

Mm, not really. I mean I I often have problems with back pain but not really any other joints.

Okay. All right.

Any problems?

All right. And um have you got any kind of symptoms down below when you're passing urine?

Uh no there's been no problems there.

Okay. Any painful urination at all?

Uh, not at all, no.

Are you passing urine more often than normal?

Uh, mm, I don't think so, no it's been fairly regular.

Okay. Have you been abroad anywhere recently?

Yes, I have actually.

Where have you been?

I went to Vietnam uh I came back four weeks ago now.

Okay. Uh and um uh did you take malaria preventative medication when you went out there?

I did, yes.

Which one did you take?

Ooh, I can't remember now off the top of my head.

Was it a weekly tablet or a daily tablet?

I think it was daily.

Okay. Um and was it one tablet or was there another one that you would take on on top of the first one?

I think it was uh another one that I took on top of the first one.

Okay. And what were you doing out in Vietnam? Was it just you staying in the cities or going to villages or hiking what what kind of activities were you doing?

It was quite a mix really cause we were there for a a few weeks and we toured to uh several different parts of the country in the the countryside and some cities as well.

Okay. And and um did you do any kind of were you in rivers or things like that were you you know how adventurous were you?

Um sorry could you repeat that? I missed that.

Were you going out into the rivers were you going on beaches I mean how how adventurous was your trip?

Yes it was quite adventurous we were sort of trekking and um cycling uh through farmland and um seeing how people lived in their day-to-day life in in farmland.

Right, okay. Um thank you for sharing that with me. Now do you have um any other illnesses at all in the past?

Mm as I said I I've been struggling with back pain for quite a while but I haven't really had any um major illnesses in the past that I can think of.

And that back pain have you um have you seen anyone about that?

Yes, yeah I'm under a physiotherapist at the moment for that.

Uh huh have they given you any kind of diagnosis at all?

Um, they've said that it's related to long periods of time sitting at a desk and just uh bad posture so mainly the exercises are focused on improving posture and and strength of the muscles in the back.

All right. Um are there any illnesses in your family at all?

Mm, the main one would be um heart attack. My my father passed away of that.

Sorry to hear that. Um how how old was he when that happened?

Um, sixty-eight I think. Yeah.

Okay. Um are you on any medication at all?

Uh just Cerazette.

Okay. Uh do you have any allergies at all to any medication?

Mm no I've just really pollen allergy that's all I have.

Okay. So hay fever.

Yes, yeah just hay fever.

All right. Um are you um you're working at the moment?

Uh I am yes.

What do you work as?

I work as a nurse.

Okay. All right. Um and um you're up to date with all your vaccinations Hepatitis B that kind of thing?

Yes indeed, yeah.

Okay.

But I'm I'm really struggling quite a lot at work at the moment. It's been quite difficult feeling so uh tired all the time.

Sure. Okay. Um and are you a uh are you a smoker at all?

No, I'm not.

Okay. And do you drink much alcohol?

Mm moderate alcohol intake. Yeah I don't drink too much.

And how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally?

I try and do some moderate physical exercise a few times a week.

Okay. That's good. All right. Um so um what uh I think we're going to need to do is we're going to need to bring you into one of our clinics exactly and we're going to need to arrange some blood tests as well. Okay? Um so what what I want to do is the first question that I have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this fe- this fever and these symptoms because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me. There's no uh when someone has got fever and sweats we want to find out have they got a chest infection have they got a throat infection. Um and if we can't find a focus of infection then that's something that that's an outstanding question that needs to be answered, okay? Um the second thing, second factor is that you've recently come from uh Vietnam and you've had exposure to rural areas and we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well. So um you're probably going to need some blood tests after you've been seen by somebody. Um now the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you which is why we're going to go go for the examination first. You could come into one of our clinics in central London that's one option and then the the GP there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be. Or if it's inconvenient for you to come into central London because you you live you're living further out you could actually just attend a local A&E. I'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of tests I think you need in the notes for this appointment so you could show that to them at reception. Um I'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films to check for malaria and inflammatory markers and things like that. Tec- technical terms but they'll understand what that what I'm talking about. But um I I don't think you can go into work uh until we've sorted this out and we we know we need to sort this out sooner rather than later.

Okay. That that sounds great. Thank you so much for your help. I I think yeah I can come straight into central London today to get that sorted.

Okay fine. So what I'm going to do is I will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in and if you can ring the number that I leave in your consultation notes after a few minutes and then they'll slot you in and then we can sort things out from there, okay?

That's brilliant. Thank you very much.

All right then. Okay. Take care then. All the best.

Goodbye.

Bye.
