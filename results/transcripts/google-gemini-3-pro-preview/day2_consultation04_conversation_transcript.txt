Hi there, good morning.

Hello.

I'm Dr. Dean Mizra from GP at Hand, nice to see you.

Lovely to meet you.

Okay, so before we start your appointment, could I please confirm your full name and date of birth?

Uh, my name is Tracy Chaplin and, um, my date of birth is... God...

Just tell me how old you are.

I'm 45.

45, okay. And could you confirm the first line of your address and your postcode?

Uh, 15 Babylon Street, um, W6 5... something.

That's good. Okay, thank you. Um, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment?

Yes.

Okay, fantastic. All right, so tell me what's been going on. You said you were a bit short of breath, is that right?

Yeah, yeah, feeling very sort of breathless recently. Um, I like, I don't know, whenever I like breathe deeply, it sort of catches in, in the right hand side of my back.

Right, okay, okay. And how long has this been going on for now?

Just, just a day really.

Right, okay. Any other symptoms at the same time that you've had this pain?

Um, well I've had, I've got a bit of a slight fever, um, and, and I, well I coughed up a bit of blood on, on two occasions.

Right, okay. I'm not sure what that means.

Okay, all right, it might, it might all be connected then. Um, and, um, yesterday before this, all of this, were you completely fine?

Um, yeah, yeah, kind of. I could, I sort of feel my heart beating but other than that, no, sort of fine.

Okay, so you can feel your heart kind of, um, beating a bit, bit faster, do you think, than normal? Is that...

I don't know, I can just sort of feel it more, I don't know. Um, but I've, I've also, I've been feeling a bit, like a bit tired at work. Haven't really been, like exercising has been a bit difficult because I've been feeling tired. Um, and yeah, performing daily activities has, has been a bit harder than usual.

Okay, all right. And, um, how long has that been for, the tiredness and, you know, not wanting to exercise?

Um, on, only after, only for a couple of weeks or so.

Couple of weeks, okay. And then, and the last day or so, that's when you get the cough and the pain in the side, and you've coughed up some blood. Okay, all right. Um, you said you felt a bit warm. Have you measured your temperature at all?

Um, with the back of my hand, yes. But...

Fair enough, yeah, you just feel, feel hot with that. Okay, fair enough. All right. Um, okay, and now can I just ask, um, do you smoke at all?

Uh, no.

Okay. What do you work as?

Um, I work in an office, just a desk job.

Okay, all right. And, um, do you live alone?

Uh, yes.

Yeah. In a flat or a house?

Flat.

Okay. Do you have any pets?

Cat.

A cat, okay. Um, a, are you on any medication at all, regular medication?

Uh, yeah, um, meth, methotrexate. Methotrexate, that's the one.

Methotrexate, okay. What are you on that for?

Um, I've, I've got SLE.

SLE, okay. Do you have any other diagnoses, any other illnesses at all?

No.

Right, okay. Um, and do you have any allergies to any medication?

No.

Any other allergies at all?

No.

Okay. So, um, you're on, you're taking methotrexate at the moment. When was the last time you had methotrexate?

Uh, this morning.

You had it this morning. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Um, um, couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and, um, get an idea of how unwell you are, okay? Um, the first thing I'd like to do is to try and measure your pulse. So wh, the way we're going to do this is that if you, if I can get you to try and locate the pulse on your wrist. Okay. Not everyone can do this, so don't worry if you can't. But if you, if you can tell me whether you can feel the radial pulse, it's just under the thumb. If you put two fingers up and down like that, you might be able to feel the pulse.

I've got it.

You've got it, okay. Are you sure?

Yeah.

All right. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting, okay? So I'll just get my stopwatch up. Okay, so if you can, um, you've still got the pulse?

Yeah.

Okay. So if you can start counting now, please.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.

If you can stop now. So that, I think that was about 11 or 12. Um, so that would make your heart rate about 66 to 74, which that's, that's okay, good. Fantastic. Um, the next thing I'd like you to try and do, okay? Um, it depends on the lighting so it may not be possible, but next thing I'd like to try and do is just, do you, get you to squeeze the tip of your finger and then let me see how quickly the redness comes back. Okay, so if you can see what I'm doing now, my finger's come right to the screen. I'm squeezing it, okay? Just, just watch me first, just watch, just watch me first. Yeah. I'm, I'm squeezing it and then you can see that it goes pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour, okay? So if I can get you just to put your finger up to the, your camera and then with the other hand just try and squeeze it and...

Yeah, yeah, you've got very good circulation.

You did it?

Okay, perfect, that's great. Thank you so much. The last thing I'd like to do is I'd like to try and have a look down your throat. Okay? A, are you doing this consultation via, um, a phone or a laptop?

Phone.

A phone?

Phone, rested it on my laptop so I think we're good to go.

So, say that again?

Got it rested on my laptop but...

Okay, fine, okay. So if you, if you, um, position your device up above your head, put your head back, mouth open wide, and let me see if I can have a look inside. That's fantastic. Say ah.

Ah.

Perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent.

Lovely.

Okay. Last thing is if I can get you to feel inside your neck. Just on the sides here, okay? Um, by your Adam's apple, tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not.

No, they feel pretty normal to me.

Okay. I think.

All right. Um, now, um, uh, sorry, I've forgotten your name.

Um, Doris.

Doris, okay, Doris. Um, so, so Doris, um, what, what I think we need to do is, um, this sounds like you might have a chest infection, okay? If you're coughing up blood and you're feeling your heart racing, um, uh, I think you need to be examined today. Someone needs to listen to your chest and, um, maybe check your blood pressure as well and check that you're stable. I have to say, examining you now, from what limited examination I could do online, your, everything does seem to be okay in terms of you, you don't seem acutely unstable. However, if you've got this kind of pain, um, when taking a deep breath in, you're coughing up blood, we do need, we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a pneumonia or a chest infection. And, um, that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope and you may need, um, an antibiotic. There's just one thing I need to ask you. Have you been on any long haul flight recently?

No. No.

No. Okay. Have you ever had any clots in your legs or clots in your lung? Blood clots?

Not that I know of, no.

No. Okay. Anyone in the family have that?

No.

No. Okay. All right. Um, what I think we'll do is, um, we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today, okay? Um, I would like someone to listen to your chest and to check your blood pressure and to recheck your pulse as well. Just make sure, and check your temperature. Make sure all those parameters are okay. You may well need an antibiotic, okay? Um, do you have any allergies to any antibiotics?

No.

No, okay. Um, I, I'm not, I'm going to not, I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now because I think you need to have that basic assessment first, um, before we proceed to the next step. But that's what I would predict the next step might be. Um, I'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment for you to ring our support team and then they will book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs today and then they'll do that assessment and then we'll take it from there, okay?

But we don't think I'm dying of lung cancer?

Um, uh, given the, the way in which you have presented now, just one day with a fever and this slight pain concurrent with the, the blood in the, the phlegm, that's not usually how lung cancers present. They're more insidious over a longer period of time with other symptoms. Um, however, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination findings when we see you.

Okay.

All right. A, are you worried about lung cancer?

Well, you know, if you start coughing up blood and you think you're going to die of lung cancer. So...

Sure, of course, yeah. So just remind me how old you are again? I'm sorry.

45.

45, okay. It's something we do need to be cognizant of, okay? Um, and we may end up having to do a follow-up chest X-ray if things don't settle down. But at the moment it, it seems more like a chest infection rather than a lung cancer.

That's good to know.

Yeah, that, that is good to know, yes, 'cause that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are okay because chest infections can become nasty as well and can lead to infections inside the body and we want to avoid that as well. So let's get you checked out today and hopefully we can put your mind to rest and get you on the right course of treatment.

Perfect. Thank you very much.

All right, you're welcome. All right, take care then. All the best.

Bye.
