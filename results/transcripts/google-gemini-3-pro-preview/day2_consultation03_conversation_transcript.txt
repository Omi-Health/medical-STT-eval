Okay great. So how can I help you today?

Um so just been having some um problems with my hearing. I can't really hear very well and my... my face has just been feeling a bit numb recently.

Right, okay. Okay. And how long has this been going on for?

Um it's been it's been a few weeks now. Um ends up about three weeks or something.

Right, okay. And is this just on one side or both sides?

Just one side, just on my left side I've noticed that the hearing's kind of gone down a bit.

Right, okay. And your face feeling numb, where exactly is that? Which part of your face? Can you can you show me with your finger?

Yeah so again it's the left side. It's kind of like around my left ear and kind of along here so like my jawline's just all feeling a bit numb round here.

Right, okay, okay. Has anything else happened um in this time? Any other symptoms you've had at all?

Mm not that I... not that I've noticed really. I've occasionally noticed a ringing in my ear...

Some ringing in your ear, okay.

Yeah hard really hard or not...

Sure, okay. And um have you had any weakness or numbness down the in the rest of the body at all?

No, no no no, nothing like that.

Okay. Have you had any difficulty swallowing?

No.

And have you had any difficulty speaking?

No, no.

Have you noticed any problems with your vision at all?

No, that's all good.

Okay. And do you have the numbness present right now?

Uh yeah, it's kind of just kind of there quite often so quite all the time so yeah right now it feels very doesn't feel like when I touch this side of my face.

Sure, sure, okay. All right. Um just going back to the kind of muffled hearing feeling in in the ear, um do you have any discharge coming from that ear at all?

No, nothing nothing coming out.

Any pain in the ear or from the ear?

Uh no.

Right, okay. And um have you had any fever at all?

No, nothing like that.

And do you um have any itchiness in the ear?

No. No.

Do you use cotton wool buds to kind of try and clean your ears out?

I don't Oh no no no don't use cotton buds.

All right. Okay. All right. Um just need to ask a few other general questions. Um do you have any other illnesses at all?

Um I well I've got kind of been told I had polyps in my nose in the past and occasionally get some kind of heartburny feeling um but that's all fine and you know I take a Rennie if I need to and if my nose polyps are playing up I've got a spray. Um other than that I think they said ages ago I had something called not quite remember but labyrinthitis, something like that, but again nothing nothing ongoing.

Sure, okay. So are you on any regular medication? You mentioned the spray for your nose.

Yeah so I no I only take the spray for my nose when I need it for and um sometimes take oh like Rennies but I just get that from the chemist.

Sure. And and the spray for your nose where do you get that from? Is that from a doctor?

Uh yeah they gave me a prescription ages ago.

Yeah. Do you remember the name of the spray at all?

Unfortunately I don't, sorry.

That's all right that's okay. And you're not on any other medication at all?

No.

No, okay. Do you have any any allergies to any medication?

Uh no, just latex.

Latex, okay. All right that's good to know. And um in terms of your family are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all?

My brother has neurofibromatosis I think it is.

Right, okay.

Other than that everyone else is okay.

Okay good, that's good to hear. Um and in in terms of your own kind of background now, are you are you working at the moment?

Yeah so I'm a I'm a jockey um but because of all the kind of the symptoms I've been getting especially sometimes when I get a ringing I can feel a bit dizzy um I've just had to do far less training. So kind of beginning to yeah impacting work um a little bit now.

Okay. So you have to excuse my ignorance, you mean jockey like with horses? Is that what you're talking about?

Yeah. Yeah.

Oh right, okay, fine. Great. Um and uh do you live alone?

Um I uh live with my partner.

Ah, okay, right. Um do you have any pets at all at home?

No, no pets.

Okay, fine. Fantastic. All right. Um is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what's been going on recently?

Uh no just like like I said like the ringing um occasionally and when I get that I can sometimes feel a bit dizzy but the main thing is really this lack of hearing and the numbness that's got me a bit like just yeah no idea what's going on there.

Okay fine. All right. Um...

There was just like there was one thing I think just cause I can panic and you can look online and you get a bit frantic. I I guess what I'm trying to think is you know is there something particularly serious that you know will need to be sorted and obviously reading anything can make you really frantic and you know is it hopefully nothing like so serious I could die from it? I don't know I just I think I'm getting myself a bit worked up.

Okay so um uh obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via video uh portal but um from what you've told me this doesn't seem to be like anything um that you're going to die from. However I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today. Okay? I'd would like you to come into one of our clinics I'd I'd like a GP to assess you. This what you what you're describing might be something called Bell's Palsy. Okay. Um we can go into that explaining what that is if um if that's confirmed on on physical examination. But um that's not usually a life-threatening problem. But um part of the reason why I'd like you to come in is just that we can just do a uh what we call a a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on and confirm whether that might be the diagnosis. Have a look have a look inside the ear see if there's any pro anything to see within the ear. So um uh so in answer to your question no I don't think that you need to worry about that. I think you know preliminarily I can I can reassure you. However you know to to definitively reassure you I think you need a physical examination today. Okay? So so what I'm going to do is I'm going to send a message to our admin team. I'll ask them to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics um within central London. Okay? And then you can ring the the support team number. I'll leave that number in your notes. You can ring them after five minutes and then they'll slot you into a place that's convenient for you, okay?

Okay yeah that's fine.

All right? So someone will will see you and hopefully will be able to reassure you further but please make sure the appointment gets done today.

Okay yep no will do that's fine. Thank you very much.

All right then. Okay. Nice to see you. Take care then.

Bye.

Bye.
