Um, so basically I've been really stressed at work for the past few days and I've realized that I've got really dry itchy skin.
Okay. Um, sorry to hear work's been so stressful. Um, tell me more about your skin first. Tell me, you mentioned it's been dry and itchy. Um, whereabouts on your skin?
All over my arms, um, and my hands mainly.
Okay. Um, and is this something you've had before?
Uh no. Never happened.
So did it did it come about quite suddenly or was it more kind of a gradual thing?
I think it started a few days ago.
Okay. And has this spread anywhere else? Has it spread to your to your chest, your legs, your face?
Uh no.
No. Okay. So apart from being dry and itchy, um, any other symptoms? Has it been sore? Has it been uh have you noticed any cracked skin?
Um, so my skin's quite red. Um, and I'm using coconut butter for the past few days.
Okay. Has that helped?
I don't have any spots.
Okay.
No fevers. And I'm not sweating either.
Thank you for mentioning all those. Um, okay, uh so the coconut butter hasn't helped with the itch?
No, it hasn't.
Okay. And uh you mentioned work's been quite stressful. What do you do for work?
Um, I work as a teacher.
Okay. And uh in what way has work been stressful?
I think the kids have been really annoying these days.
Okay. Well...
And I've been working really long hours.
Okay. All right. Well I'm sorry to hear that and I hope it gets better. Um, going back to your skin, is it anything you've done perhaps uh which may have triggered your symptoms? Anything you've touched or you know for example shower gels, soaps, fabric fabric cleaners?
I mean I went swimming a few days ago.
Okay. Is that the first time in your life or have you been before?
Uh no I've been before.
Okay. And did your symptoms start after you went swimming?
Yes, did.
Okay. All right. Um you mentioned you've had no other fevers. Is that right? No fevers, no vomiting?
No.
No. How's your health otherwise?
It's pretty good. Yeah. I'm not on any medication.
We'll get to medication in just a second. Um, do do you feel generally run down? Do you feel tired?
Uh yeah, I think I have been quite tired.
Okay. Okay. Are you eating and drinking okay?
Yeah, I've been drinking and eating as normal.
Your appetite is fine, is it? Okay. And your bowels? Are your bowels working okay?
Yeah.
Uh no no problems with vomiting or loose stools?
No.
Okay. And your waterworks are all okay? You're passing urine okay?
Yep.
Okay. All right. Um, so just moving on. In terms of your other medical history, is there anything else I should be aware of?
I'm currently taking Microgynon?
Microgynon?
Yeah.
Okay. Do you know what that is?
Uh no.
Okay. It's a contraceptive pill.
Okay.
Does that make sense? Is that something you is that does that ring a bell now?
Uh yeah.
Okay. Is it any other medications that you take?
Uh no.
No. So in terms of your medical history, there's no problems of skin problems in the past, things like eczema or um dermatitis?
Uh no. I think it might just be the weather.
Sorry, what was that? You think it's...
I think it might just be the weather?
The weather?
Yeah.
Oh you think the weath... Okay. You think the weather. Okay. No it's okay. No no problems. We'll um move And do you do you suffer from allergies? Are you someone who suffers from allergies?
Um...

Lactose intolerant. Okay. That could be helpful to know. Um, fine. In terms of family history, is there anything in the family that you're aware of?
Um, yeah. So um my dad has asthma and my mum has hay fever.
Hay fever?
Yep.
Okay. Um, fine. Any again any skin problems I should be aware of?
Uh no.
No. Okay. All right. Socially, who do you live with at home?
Uh just me.
Live alone?
Yep.
And uh do you smoke at all? Do you can I ask do you smoke? Are you a smoker?
Uh no I don't smoke.
Do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
Uh no.
Recreational drugs?
Nope.
Okay. And you told me men you work as a primary school teacher?
Yes, that's right.
The reason I ask is sometimes stress can be a contrib contributing factor. Um, you felt you noticed yourself find life to be more stressful recently. Is that right?
Do you think that might have any correlation to your symptoms?
I mean I don't I don't think so.
Okay. All right. Um fine. Um Okay. Well normally at this stage I'd like to proceed to examination but um based on your story um it's difficult. I think you know you've essentially the story is you've got a dry itchy rash on your mainly your hands you mentioned um and your arms which started perhaps after swimming a few days ago. Um but no other symptoms. You're feeling otherwise well. No fevers. No bleeding or discharge from the skin. I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis. Um have you heard of that condition before?
I have, yes.
Okay. Um great. Well I can give you a patient information leaflet about that which gives a bit more information about the disease but um it's something that can be readily treated um with a couple of options. We have steroid creams I can give you um which will help with the inflammation. And uh something called emollients which can help with the dry dry skin. And that's something you just need to kind of paste on uh onto your skin uh throughout the day for the next few days. Um and hopefully that helps your symptoms.
Okay. Cool. Thank you very much.
Um you can also try antihistamines so you can get things over the counter, Piriton, Loratadine that can sometimes help with itchiness.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Okay. And um that's probably what I recommend. Paracetamol on this occasion wouldn't be helpful. Um uh painkillers wouldn't be helpful in on this occasion but let's let's let's see how the next few days go. And if it's still not getting better come back and see me next week and we can have another look again at your symptoms.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.
Right. Do you have any questions for me?
Uh no.
Okay. Well I wish you all the best. Have a good day.
Cool. Thank you very much. Bye.
Bye bye.
