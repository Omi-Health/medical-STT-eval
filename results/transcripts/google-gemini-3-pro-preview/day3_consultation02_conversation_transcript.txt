Hello, hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon.

Hi.

Hi. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please?

Yeah, John Doe.

Okay, and your date of birth?

Um, I, uh, 21/12, uh, 19... 86.

And your address for me please?

Uh, it is uh, number one London Street, um NW3 6PQ.

That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation.

We are, yes.

Okay. So I understand you're having a headache. Is that correct?

Uh, yeah, I've had a... um a sort of a fairly sort of bad severe headache for the past four days. Um, and um I've been sort of feeling a bit hot as well. Um, got got a bit of a temperature I think. I haven't measured it but um I think I yeah, I think I've got a fever.

Okay. Right. And um, so what started first? Was it the headache or the fever?

Um, so um headache started uh first. Um, and then sort of yeah fever sort of came along a bit afterwards.

Okay, afterwards. Right. And what have you taken so far for your headache?

Um, so I've had some paracetamol and some ibuprofen, but it's not really helping at the moment.

Okay. So just a few more questions with regards to your headache. So do you find it difficult to look at the light?

Um, no. My... uh my... like um it's fine. Light doesn't seem to bother me too much.

Okay. Uh, and is it any pain when you try to move your neck from side to side, look up and down, is there any pain?

Um, I've got sort of general aching muscles. Um, not necessary sort of in my neck. It's kind of a bit all over really.

Okay, all over. Right. And have you been sick with this headache?

No. No, I haven't haven't been sick.

Okay. And do you have a cough?

Uh, no, no cough.

Okay, so there's no cough or cold, yeah?

Uh, no. No.

Okay. And you your ears are okay? There's no earaches?

Um, no. It it seems to be okay. It's that's fine.

Okay. All right. And with this headache, have you experienced any sort of pins and needles in your face, arms, and legs?

Uh, no.

Okay. Any muscle weaknesses at all?

Um, just a I suppose general aching, body aching.

Not not any weakness, like where you couldn't, you know, hold a cup or anything like that, that's what I mean.

Uh, no, um I'm sort of yeah I'm seem to be sort of fine with that sort of stuff but yeah.

Okay. And um, just a few more questions to you because I don't have any of your background history. Um, do you suffer from any medical conditions?

Uh, no. Um, general medical history is fine.

Fine. And no surgical history that... no medical or surgical complaints, yeah?

Uh, no. Um I I suppose uh I have been away to um uh Thailand um uh a sort of week or so ago. Um, I've had some like usual mosquito bites from sort of traveling around and a friend of mine has also been a bit unwell but um... uh yeah that's the only sort of like history per se.

Right. And um, do you have any kind of shivering at all? Do you shivering with the fever?

Um, I um... uh I I do feel cold quite a lot. Um you know it's um no sort of shivering but definitely like a bit cold.

Hot and cold, yeah?

Yeah.

Okay. Right. And are you using... you've mentioned about the paracetamol, ibuprofen now, but are you on any reg- regular any medication, anything that you're using at all?

Uh, no.

Okay. Um, any allergies at all?

Uh, no.

All right. Okay. And... okay. So I... I believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you. Yeah? Uh... it it's not uh pos- possible for us to do that online. I think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination. And uh I think you would need one quite urgently. Okay? So the things that's running in the back of my mind are um kind of viral illnesses that can one can get with um sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel. Like malaria. Um the the other common thing around Thailand it will be like some dengue but that would have like you would have some uh blood spots or bleeding or something which you don't have at the moment, do you?

Uh... n- no. I I mean I've got a bit of a rash but nothing like uh no no no bleeding.

Okay. So where's the rash?

Um, it's uh... rash is kind of all all over my body. Like... it's not really localized.

How would you describe... how would you describe the rash?

Um, uh sort of red and itchy.

Red and itchy. Okay. So if you were to put a glass on top of the rash, does that rash go away?

Uh, yes.

It goes away. Okay. Okay. So what I'll... what we need to do is we need to urgently examine you. And that's sometime today. Okay? And um after our examination there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital but I'm not sure as yet. So I'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible. Okay? So um I'll write my notes in and recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor preferably in the next few hours time. Okay? And um in any case if that's not available, I'd like you to take yourself to A&E. Okay?

All right. Any questions at all?

Uh, no. Sounds serious.

It's... you know, obviously when I've spoken to you, you you didn't tick the box for many serious but you're in the middle somewhere, let's put it that way. Okay? Um if if you, you know, things like we have to rule out is meningitis and all but then you just have a general muscle ache, you didn't say that you had things like you had problems looking at the light or something. So those are things when we think of meningitis. But and then it's the uh in meningitis you get a non-blanching rash while in any kind of virus, you know, the rash usually goes away. Saying that, we don't know whether these are the beginning stages. So that's why I'd rather... but I would rather you see a GP as soon as possible if uh we've got a slot available but if not, I think you need to be seen and maybe have some blood tests and examinations. Okay?

Okay. Cool. Thank you very much.

All right. You take care then. Bye now. Cheers. Bye.
