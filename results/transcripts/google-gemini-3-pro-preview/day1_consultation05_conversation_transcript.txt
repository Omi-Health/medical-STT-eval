Hello.

Hi.

Good morning, Kim. Um, how can I help you this morning?

Um, so I'm having some some pain in my tummy like the lower part of my tummy.

Okay.

Um and I'm just feeling quite hot and sweaty.

Right, I'm sorry to hear that. When when did your symptoms all start?

About two days ago.

Okay. And whereabouts in your tummy is the pain exactly?

Uh like below my belly button? It's like quite sore when I press on it.

Okay. Did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual?

Not really just sort of... it hasn't been it's more gradual and it's just getting a bit worse now.

Okay, okay. And can you describe the pain to me?

Uh it's kind of like a a I guess a burning pain? Uh and it's just right there in that spot like that's mostly where I'm feeling it. It hasn't spread anywhere else.

Just in just below your belly button you mentioned.

Yeah.

Um and is the pain constant or does it come and go?

It's fairly constant. It's like getting worse um it's not like I I can still move and walk around uh I mean I'm still kind of functioning it's just uh I'm aware of it the whole time.

Mm hm, okay. Um and with that pain have you noticed any other symptoms at all so for example let's let's focus firstly on your bowels are your bowels working okay?

Yeah, I had a bit of constipation but that's better now that was like just last week.

Okay, so you've got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose stools?

No. I I my bowel movements are normal now.

Okay. And what about your waterworks are you passing urine okay?

Yeah, I'm fine that's fine that I did notice that I was a little the urine was a little pink in color but I haven't like it hasn't really been burning specifically or hurting when I pee and uh and I did notice I was going to the I was peeing more regularly but I have been drinking lots of fluids so I wasn't sure um I wasn't sure um like was you know if that was related to the pain.

Can when you mentioned pink urine do you was there any blood at all in your urine or is it difficult to say?

I can't say. I mean maybe.

Okay. All right but otherwise it doesn't hurt uh or or sting when you pass urine?

I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that. Um just that I'm peeing more than off more regularly.

Okay. Um okay. And um moving up towards uh other symptoms have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all?

Just a little nauseous um but no vomiting.

No vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers?

I haven't real I felt a bit hot and sweaty but I haven't really measured it so I can't really say.

Okay, fine. Um and Kim just have to ask um uh you know all all female patients just questions about your cycles if you don't mind me asking. Um are you currently um are you currently sexually active?

Uh yeah I've had the same partner I am we were last sexually active about four days ago. Um my last STD screen was normal which was about six months ago.

Okay. So you've had no other partners since then.

No other partners since then.

Okay. Um uh and do you use any contraception at all?

Um on the Implanon I had the Implanon inserted about a year ago.

Implanon okay fine. Um are you still having periods?

Yes.

And when was your last period?

Uh my last period was about three weeks ago. I mean two weeks ago.

Two weeks ago. Okay. So is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an Implanon in there but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? Some for us to think about potentially.

Well we don't use any other barrier methods so we just use the imp I just have the Implanon and the same partner. Um theoretically if the Implanon hasn't been working then I could be pregnant but I don't suspect.

Okay well something for us to think about um maybe worth doing a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that. Um okay and and so just to summarize so far if you don't mind it's really for the last couple of days this tummy pain that's really affected you mainly lower down towards your belly button it's quite burning you said is getting worse. Um you notice some pink urine um but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine. Your bowels are working okay. You felt a little bit nauseous um and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right?

Yeah, that sounds very accurate.

Is there anything else perhaps that you feel like you should share with me at this stage which you think might be important?

I don't think so. I think we've covered everything that's really bothering me.

Yeah, okay. Um tell me tell me a bit more about your um medical history otherwise. Are you normally fit and well?

Yeah quite well. I haven't had any surgical I don't have any surgical history. I don't have any previous I haven't had any operations before or and I'm not on any other medication I just have the Implanon.

Okay. Um have you had anything like this before in the past any similar symptoms?

I've never had I've never had these symptoms before.

No, okay. Um fine. Um any other family history I should be aware of anything relevant family uh related to the bowels maybe related to gynae history?

No, not that not that I'm aware of no.

Okay. All right. Um and socially just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you?

Uh I live in a share house um with two other two other roommates.

Okay. Um and uh are you currently working?

Yeah I currently I am currently working.

What do you do for work?

I am an accountant.

Okay. Um great. Okay. Um do you smoke at all Kim?

No.

No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?

So socially I drink but uh I don't think more more than normal.

No. Okay. Standard standards.

Okay. Um just before I go to examination I just want to go through just some few screening questions if that's okay yes or no. Uh we've we've covered the majority of them already um but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else. Um how's your how how's your chest how's your breathing? Um have you felt I don't feel short of breath or or I'm not having any problems or I don't have a cough or anything that's worrying me.

Okay. Any uh funny heartbeats or rhythms palpitations?

Not that no.

Any headaches any problems with your vision?

No.

No. Okay. All right. Um fine. Okay. Um so really just um moving on um so base based on your story really uh Kim it's it's a it's difficult one it's it's it's um we know you've got some tummy pain we don't exactly know what's causing it could be a few different things that could be causing your pain. Uh it could just be a you know could just be a urine infection for example could just be something related to your gut um could this be something related to your you know a pregnancy related cause. Um and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out um what's going on here. Um which I can organize for you today.

Okay.

Um and based on those tests we we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed but certainly if if if it's been going on for the last couple of days um uh you know it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for maybe a urine infection uh so with some anti with some anti.

Yeah can we do that instead of me going for tests and then seeing how that goes?

Yeah, absolutely. So um I think it's certainly worth you know covering you with some antibiotics today. Uh but I still want you to bear in mind you know having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here and um and I want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time if your symptoms are not getting any better or indeed if they're getting worse. So things to look out for would be you know worsening tummy pain um if you're feeling really hot and sweaty the temperature is not coming down um vomiting etc. Does that make sense?

Yeah, I think I'm happy with that plan.

Okay. Um you can try just regular painkillers uh paracetamol will be advisable um make sure you drink plenty of fluids you can try some cranberry juice as well which can sometimes help with your urine symptoms. Um take the antibiotics uh and give me a call if you know if you are worried about anything else.

Uh sure, that sounds great. Thank you very much. Um shall I just collect the script at my pharmacy?

Yeah I'll send it straight to your pharmacy start the antibiotics today something called Trimethoprim um take two tablets uh or one tablet twice a day for three days.

Okay great that sounds good.

Let's say how you get on.

Okay, thank you very much.

Great. All the best.

Bye.

Bye bye.
