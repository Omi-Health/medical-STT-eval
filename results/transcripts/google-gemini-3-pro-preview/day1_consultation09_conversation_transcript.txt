Um, it's it's not too bad. It's sort of like a stinging kind of pain. Um, it's not like unbearable but uh it's it's definitely uh definitely bothers me when I pee. Um and uh yeah, I also maybe sometimes get some like pain kind of lower down in my tummy when I when I go to the bathroom. Uh Yeah.

Okay. And and uh the pain in your tummy, is it can you describe the feel the pain to me? Is it cramping, burning, sharp?

Um, yeah, I don't know, maybe uh sort of sort of cramping. I'm not really sure. But it's not like it's not like cramping like when I get when I have a period or something like it's like I don't know.

Right. Okay. Okay, um fine. Have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal?

Um, not I don't think so. I haven't noticed it.

No. Okay, fine. Have you noticed any any funny color to your urine? So has there been uh any blood in your urine or have you noticed any other darkening of your urine?

Um, there was a little bit of blood earlier today, um but besides that not at all, no. Um, it does kind of it kind of like doesn't smell very it smells a bit weird I guess. Um but no, not really anything uh anything drastic.

Okay. Fine, okay. Um right, let me just take write a few notes down as well. Um Fine. And you mentioned the tummy pain, that also started a few days ago. Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards the back or towards your flank? The sides?

Um No, not really, no.

No. Okay. Fine. With this symptoms, have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting?

Uh, no, not not at all.

Okay. Any fevers or temperatures?

No fever. Okay, fine. Sorry. Um, okay. Um, in terms of your bowel, are your bowels working okay?

Um, I I think so, yeah. It seems normal.

No um any any diarrhea, loose stool?

Uh, no, not that I've not that I've noticed at all.

Okay. All right. And um Jessica, sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions uh just to get get a full history. Um, hope you don't mind me asking, are you currently sexually active?

Uh, yeah, I am.

Okay, and is that with a regular partner?

Um, yeah, so I I've had a boyfriend for about a couple months now, yeah.

Uh, yeah, we use condoms.

Use condoms. Okay. And when was your last period?

Uh a couple weeks ago.

Couple weeks ago. Okay. Is there any chance you could be pregnant perhaps?

Say again?

Is there any is there any chance you could be pregnant?

Uh, I don't think so.

No. It's always worth asking young females like yourself. Uh uh so if that obviously if you are worried about the pain um not getting any better uh then I would always advise you doing a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. Okay?

Um, fine. Just moving on moving on, are you otherwise fit and well?

Um, yeah, I think I'm I'm feeling okay otherwise, yeah.

And so by that I mean do you have any other medical problems, medical his medical history?

Um, so in the past I've had some uh some IBS, um but other than that I think no like uh real serious medical problems that seem yeah.

Okay. Do you take any regular medications?

Uh, no. I did uh I did uh a little bit ago or a couple days ago try some uh over the counter bicarbonate to try and help with the pain but it wasn't it wasn't really helping.

Okay, so you tried that and didn't help. Okay. All right. Um, do you have any allergies to any medications?

Uh, yeah, I'm allergic to Clindamycin.

Okay. And what happens when you take Clindamycin?

Um, I I get some like a a swelling basically.

Right, okay, so it's quite seems like a quite severe allergy to it. Is is that right? Um, okay. Fine. In terms of your family history, is there anything I should be aware of um related to kidneys, bladder, bowels, gut?

Uh, no, I don't think so. Not that I not anything I know about.

Okay. All right. And tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who lives who's at home with you?

Um, so I live in a live in a flat near my college with uh a couple like friends of mine. Uh, so I'm I'm not like living at home or anything. Um Is that what you were asking about, sorry?

Okay. And are you are you working at the moment or are you a student?

I'm a student.

Okay, and what are you studying?

Uh I'm studying biology.

Okay, and how's that going?

Um, it's good, yeah. It's really it's really interesting uh learning about learning about how uh how the world works. Yeah.

Great. Do you have any aspirations for the future in terms of careers?

Uh, I don't know. Maybe a doctor someday. You never know.

Recommend it. We need doctors. Um what about smoking and alcohol? Do you drink much in the way of uh do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol?

Uh, I don't I don't smoke. Uh I do drink like on the weekends.

Yeah. Socially. Okay. All right. Um right, excellent. So um at this stage I I would proceed to examination, but um based on your story, um just to summarize really, the last three days you've been having bit of burning pain on passing urine, a bit of crampy tummy pain lower down. Um essentially but but no other fevers or back pain uh if I if I understand correctly. I think you probably do have what we call a simple UTI or a urinary tract infection. A bladder infection. Um which can be readily treated. So I can give you a course of antibiotics today. Something called either Nitrofurantoin or Trimethoprim. Uh and it's normally a three day course. Uh so one tablet twice a day for three days. And that should hopefully help your symptoms. But I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids. Let's try and flush that, you know, that infection out your body if you can. Um you can try cranberry juice that can sometimes help with your symptoms. Um and if you're still not better by the end of this week, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me and uh we can have another look at your symptoms.

Okay.

Okay?

Okay, so three three days of the medication and then wait a little bit. If it still doesn't go away call back?

Yeah, absolutely. And things to look out for would be, you know, if you are having kind of high temperatures, back pain, um just generally feeling more unwell, uh you know, I do want you to give me a call back cause then we do worry whether your infection maybe spreading up towards your kidneys which is something we want to avoid. So do do give me a call if you have any concerns, okay?

Okay. Is there is there anything like like should I be worried about like like not having sex or anything within the next week or anything like this?

Um I mean if you can try and avoid it, I think that would be sensible. Um uh it's great that you're using barrier contraception. I would recommend you to continue using barrier contraception. But if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up that'll probably be the best for you and your boyfriend.

Okay. Okay.

All right?

Uh that that makes sense.

Great.

Okay. Thank you so much.

Thank you very much. Wish you all the best.

Yeah, thank you. Take care.

Bye bye.
