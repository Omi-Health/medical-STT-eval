Hello, hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello.

Hi.

So, um, just before we start, is it alright if you could confirm your name for me please?

Sure. My name is Mary Smith.

And your date of birth?

My date of birth is August 16th, 1976.

And your email address for me please?

My email address is mary.smith@gmail.com.

That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation.

Absolutely.

Alright. So you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw, is that correct?

Uh, well, I think that's just like the first thing that I typed, but uh, it wasn't really what I, you know, I just typed it and then I clicked submit, so that was uh, um, I mean it's part of the problem, but I would say that more of a problem for me is that I can't quite move my left arm. I mean, I can move it but it's, it's numb and then I also feel some like tingling in my fingertips.

Okay. So numbness in the left arm, yeah?

Yes.

How long has it been going on for?

So, I've started taking this boxing class. I've been taking this boxing class for a few weeks, and I feel like maybe, um, it's probably been I'd say for at least two weeks. And it's kind of gotten worse. Like in the beginning I just kind of felt a little bit of tingling, and then it's gotten, it's gotten worse since then. Then the numbness kind of started. I can feel it both in my uh, um, you know, a little bit in my elbow and then in my arm as well as in my hand. And so now because it hasn't gotten better, I tried to get a massage, it's not better, or you know I tried to take warm baths, it's not better, so I figured I'd call you and and just figure out what's going on.

Right. So have you mentioned a massage and a warm bath. Any medications that you've taken so far?

Um, well, it's... you know, it's, it's numb and I I kind of looked stuff online... um, but, you know I do take Ibuprofen just because my my muscles were sore, uh a little bit and I've been taking this boxing class. So, you know, I kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand, so that's been a little bit painful, so I've just kind of taken Ibuprofen for that. But like I said, I mean I tried massage, I tried some hot baths and that didn't help with this numbness thing. So I'm just kind of getting a little worried.

Of course. So you also from... you've just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards, is that, you know the tingling numbness is elbow below... not from your shoulder?

Um, well it's kind of funny. You know, sometimes I will feel it in my shoulder like if I try to... if I try to like you know move like in boxing and stuff, I will even like uh, um, maybe feel a little bit of a little bit of pain. Uh, but I would say if I'm just like resting, if I, if I'm sitting like right now, I can feel like it's numb and I I actually feel tingling right now. Not in all of my fingers but just in some.

Yeah. So which fingers do you feel numb?

Okay, so it's my second, third, and fourth finger.

Uh-huh, second, third, and fourth finger. And is it your palm side or you know the back of your hand side which is numb? Or both?

No, it's, it's the, it's this side. So the front side.

It's the front side. Okay. Right. And have you been dropping things at all? Like you know when you try to hold onto things, like a glass or something? Have you been dropping it?

So not so much with the glass, but I will say, um, well, I play a little bit of a piano and so I just noticed that it's it's been kind of harder to get the notes. I can I can grasp, I can grasp a a glass but because I use my right hand most of the time, you know, I'm not left-handed, so I... it's kind of hard for me to...

So you would say there's a mild weakness? Mild...

Yes.

So, the just to get my facts right. So you would say it's definitely weakness rather than... because of the pain you can't hold it. There's two different things. So you know, sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you.

No, no, no. It's not hurting. It's not hurting, it's like numb, I can't feel it, right?

Okay. Yeah. Fine. So you have... definitely having some sort some form of weakness. Okay. Any neck pain at all?

No, not... no neck pain. Mm-mm.

No neck pain at all. Okay. Right. Okay. So just a bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system. Um, do you have any past or medical history that you'd like to share?

Well, I guess because of this... you know I'm not sure if it's boxing. I also had a really bad cold like a month ago. I mean, I was out you know drinking with uh friends... um, one of our co-workers just had his three year anniversary and we kind of went crazy and we were like out partying until you know late hours and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me. And then after that I was sick for probably good like two weeks. I was at home I think I must have had some kind of like a flu or something. So it's that and then I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago is like I all of a sudden just couldn't see from the uh, from my left eye. Like I I lost some, like a little bit of a field of vision. Um, and but that that just lasted not very long. I mean that just lasted maybe for I don't know, 20, 20 minutes. Uh, and I kind of thought I don't know maybe it was the the cold you know and the virus and all that. So I guess that's what I can... you know that's the last thing I can remember but in general I'm I'm pretty healthy. I mean I you know I workout uh a lot and I I don't really have any medical problems.

Do you have any headaches at all from the... in the recent past?

Uh, sometimes I get headaches but I think they're just tired headaches. You know, sometimes I'll get kind of tired, but I think that's probably because I work too much or you know because like I'll go for a workout and then I'll really just exhaust myself and then I just kind of feel this fatigue. Uh, or sometimes like this morning for example I just felt really fatigued and I couldn't even get myself to the gym. But you know since I have this numbness it's kind of like hard to workout, right?

Do you wear glasses at all? Glasses, contact lenses?

No.

No. So no glasses. Alright. And you've not had experienced anything like a seizure, fit, anything like that?

What's a seizure?

Like when you sh- you lose consciousness and you start shaking?

Oh, no, no, no. No, nothing like that. Mm-mm.

No fits. Yeah. Okay. And your weakness is only in your left arm. So the legs, walking and all is normal, yeah?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, walking is normal. Yeah.

You mentioned for a while you couldn't see you know the outside peripheral vision from your left eye. How long did that episode last for?

You know I think it was only maybe like 20 minutes or so. It's almost like it happened and I thought oh my god it's probably I'm still like sick from this you know virus thing cold and so I just kind of slept it off and then when I uh, um, when I woke up it was gone.

Sure. Okay. Um... Okay. So is there any regular medications that you're using?

Not really. I just take Ibuprofen every once in a while. I take Vitamin D. Um, I take some... I... like my GP my GP really wants me to take iron supplements but you know there are these like huge pills so I I most of the time I just forget. But Vitamin D I take and then sometimes I take Melatonin to help me sleep.

Okay. Alright. And any family history you'd like to share? Any significant family history?

I know that my dad has... I don't know if it's hypo... I think it's hypothyroidism. Um, and then my like he's got some autoimmune stuff going on. Like that much I know. And then my mom... my mom she's she's actually not in a great shape. She's got diabetes type 2. She's got hypertension. Um, she's got... gosh what is it? Oh yeah, she's got high cholesterol. Um, and I think that's it for her. Yeah.

Right. Any neurological conditions in the family? Nerve related conditions?

Uh... No.

No. Okay. That's fine. Okay. So... Right. So after you know speaking and examining you know yourself on there, I think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further. I'm just wondering whether there's a something a bit more than just the boxing here. Okay. There's a few things that's made me think other than just like a boxing injury is for instance... um, you know when you said you can't... your vision went... peripheral vision was not there for about twenty... so and that with the weakness of the arms make me think is there something else going on rather than just an injury.

What do you think maybe going on?

Sometimes you know you do get things like MS, multiple sclerosis. So people with multiple sclerosis can have... um, visual problems like what you've experienced and sometimes... you know the odd numbness, tingling sensations going on.

Oh my god. Will I be in wheelchair?

If we catch it a bit early, there are treatments for it. Okay? I'm not... obviously I'm not suggesting that you do have it. But it is quite important to find out that whether you have it or not. That's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be... uh, dealt with here. Yeah? So what we'll do is I'm going to do an urgent... very urgent neurology referral. Yeah? What they... what that might entail is a brain scan and things like that.

Hello? I see. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.

Okay. I know this might sound a bit of a shock to you... um, but I but I think it is quite important that we investigate this a bit more seriously.

Alright. Yeah, that makes sense.

Okay? Any questions at all?

Well what's... okay so you're gonna do the referral... um, should I be taking any drugs or...

No, that's something we can't do... the treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that when you have an acute... you know acute reaction or things like that but saying that first we need to confirm diagnosis. Yeah? While you're waiting for this to be done, if there's any weakness... you know if the weakness progresses to your legs or there's any kind of headaches, vomiting, fits, and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better, then that would be an A&E.

Okay. Got it.

Alright?

Okay. Thank you, doctor.

Yeah, I'm I'm sorry. I I do appreciate you are a bit worried but you know it's good that you know that you've come and spoken to us today and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling. Okay?

Thank you, doctor. Appreciate your time.

That's okay. You take care.

Bye bye.

Bye bye now. Bye.
