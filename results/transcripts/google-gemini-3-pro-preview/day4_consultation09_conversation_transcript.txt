Hello?

Oh, hello. Hi.

Hi, how you doing? Uh, my name's Joe, I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name please?

Yeah, sure. Daniel Brown.

Hi Daniel. And your date of birth?

May 11th, 1992.

92. Okay, Daniel. And uh, are you in a uh comfortable and confidential place to talk?

Yeah, totally.

Happy to go ahead. Great. How can I help?

Um, yeah, I just... my chest has been feeling really tight.

Okay. And how long has this been going on for, Daniel?

Uh, for about three hours now.

Okay. And so tight chest for three hours. Um, and so you were born in 92 so that makes you 26. Um 26, yeah. And you are uh any shortness of breath at all with that?

Yeah, like a little bit. Um yeah, a little bit short of breath. Not too bad.

Uh, any cough, wheeze?

Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well. And coughing. Coughing, yeah.

Tight cough, yeah?

Yeah.

Sore throat, runny nose, sore ears?

You know, I had a cold last week and it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose, I was just feeling under the weather.

Mhm. Are you feeling better now other than the tight chest?

I mean, I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore.

Right. Okay. Okay. But you know now you've got this this um so you've still got still got uh symptoms of a cold essentially.

Yeah, the cough's kind of stuck around.

Ah. Yeah, okay. Are you coughing up anything?

Uh, no.

And um do you have any other medical problems like asthma?

Yeah, yeah, I have asthma. I've had it for a while now. Um and then I have like a hay fever. You know, some allergies to dust.

Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any medications?

Um, yeah. So uh you know the um uh Ventolin... it's called uh Salbutamol?

Yeah.

I got that one and then I have a steroid uh Clenil, Clenil inhaler.

Clenil Modulite, yeah. Okay.

Yeah. Yeah.

And um uh have you been using Clenil and the Ventolin? And how often have you been using them?

Um well to be honest I was away at Uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me, so I've haven't really in the past week.

Both of them?

Because because um sorry, they ran out and I I forgot to go and grab the next one.

Yeah, sure.

About a week ago.

Okay. All right. All right. So so so you you haven't got any Clenil or any Ventolin at the moment.

Not with me right now, no. I ran out.

Okay. All right. Um and uh any drug allergies that you know of?

No. No. Not allergic to anything. Just like just the dust and stuff but nothing no drugs.

Okay, great. Now uh do you anyone in your family had any medical problems that you know of?

Um yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Uh oh, when I was young I also had eczema and I had a milk protein allergy when I was young too.

Mhm. Okay. Um. Great. So just uh do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or um hopes for this consultation?

Um not really. Like I feel like asthma's probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers wouldn't be helpful. Um it's just kind of scary cause I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight uh in a long time.

Yeah, absolutely. I can I can imagine. Um well, it certainly sounds like uh you've you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough um and it's non-productive cough and you're short of breath. Uh is the cough worse at night time?

I mean it gets a little bit worse at night but basically just pretty consistent.

Yeah.

Hasn't gone away.

Okay. And you've got this tight tight chest. But you wouldn't say you've got chest pain? Just more a tight chest, is that...

No, not really pain. It's more like tight. It just feels like sometimes I I can't get a full breath in, you know?

Yeah, sure. Um okay. Well I I would quite like to uh certainly get you some uh Ventolin, Clenil Modulite. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past?

Not in a long time. When I was young a little bit more like back in high school. Um but I've been pretty good at taking my med my inhalers so not not so much anymore.

Have you ever been to hospital uh as an inpatient? As in you know stayed in there overnight for asthma?

Yeah, when I was in high school I had to have a tube put down my throat.

Oh, okay. So you so you uh you had you went to hospital and had a uh you so you stayed in hospital for a few days did you with an asthma exacerbation?

Yeah, I did. Yeah.

Okay. But currently you're just on Ventolin and Clenil and you haven't got any of those steroids uh those inhalers at the moment.

Yeah, I've been pretty good. I've been pretty good just on the Clenil and the Salbutamol.

Okay. And when sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation?

Uh I think I was like 17. 16 maybe.

Sure. Okay. Um. Just to quantify how short of breath you are, um I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you? No, you won't have will you.

No.

Um are you able to like walk up flight of stairs okay, walk on the flat okay without getting too short of breath or um are you short of breath at rest?

Uh I'm definitely not short of breath at rest. Like except for that feeling I was describing. It does when I'm walking up stairs I do feel like I have a little bit more shortness of breath than I would normally be.

Sure. Yeah. Okay. But you're not short of breath at rest at the moment.

No. No, no I'm not.

Okay, fine. So what what I think um and just just go over is there anything you would hoped about getting other than the uh a prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else that you hoped about getting from this?

Well I just want to know that I'm okay to just like keep... I just don't want to have to get um that that intubation again.

Sure. Yeah. No. Absolutely. Well I'm really glad that you've walked talked to me today. I think what we can do is is give you a prescription for uh some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within the hour I would hope. Um and uh I think what the other thing I would like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So this is these are tablets which um you can take for five days, uh two tablets in the morning and uh that should just dampen down your asthmatic response. Okay?

Okay.

Um now there are some side effects to the steroids which I should really tell you about but please read the label that's associated with it. Don't be too worried about the side effects. They're uncommon most you know most most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated. And uh you prob... do have you had them in the past do you know of?

Sorry, sorry you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying?

Have you had steroids in the past?

Um I can't remember. Probably.

Probably. Yeah, I would have thought you did. So um they they can come they can make you your mood change, can be slightly low or too slightly high, can give you a high blood sugar, um and uh they uh I can they can also cause rash, nausea, um headaches but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help your asthma an awful lot. Okay. Um uh what I'd like to do is is send you these the some prescriptions for your uh inhalers uh ongoing so um you can once you get better from this asthma attack you can you can use the Clenil Modulite in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN base so uh Ventolin when you need to um when you're getting wheezy. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than uh every three hours uh uh at any time it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So um see a doctor um in some capacity. Uh and the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Have you do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before?

Yeah, yeah. I somebody taught me how to use one a while ago. I don't I don't really use it to be honest but.

Have you got one?

I think I do. I have one somewhere.

Okay. All right. Well um I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it but essentially uh couple of puffs to prime it inside breathing in and out um uh for five five or ten breaths.

Okay.

Uh yeah. So uh was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage?

I think you got me covered.

Okay. Um and uh I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days but uh I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better if you're okay with that.

Thanks.

All right?

Yeah. All righty. Well thank you very much.

No worries. Any deterioration in your symptoms like worsening shortness of breath um or just generally concerning symptoms uh pain in your chest tightness uh feeling lightheaded uh then seek further medical attention anytime please. Okay?

All right, sounds good.

Okay. Thank you.

Great, thank you. Bye bye.

Bye bye.
