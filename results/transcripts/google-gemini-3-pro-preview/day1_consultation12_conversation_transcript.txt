Okay, right. I'm sorry to hear that. Uh, can you tell me a bit more about your diarrhea?

Yeah, so it's been a very bad diarrhea, so it keeps me like, I keep going back and forth to to the toilet very often.

Okay. Any blood in your stools?

No, not that I could see.

Okay. And uh uh with the diarrhea, have you noticed any other symptoms like tummy pain?

Uh not not really. No. Uh but I I I feel like um I can't really drink too much, so I feel very dehydrated.

Okay. When you say you can't drink too much, why is that?

Uh yeah, because really I I I I'm like I feel like I don't drink enough. Like I'm I'm drinking, I'm trying to drink but then I just go to the loo and I like I uh I I poo everything and I feel dehydrated again.

Okay. All right. Um have you managed to eat anything? Solids?

Uh not much, not much. So just a little bit. I don't feel uh I don't really feel like I have appetite.

Okay, your appetite is reduced. Okay. Um with your um with with the vomiting is now stopped. Is that right? You said it.

Yes. Yes.

Okay. All right. Have you any other symptoms like fever or temperature?

Uh so not really. I I feel a little bit warm um probably at at the beginning I was feeling I had a bit of temperature but now I feel I feel kind of fine.

Okay.

I feel very weak though.

Feel weak. Okay. All right. Any headaches or muscle pains?

Not not really. No.

Okay. All right. And you mentioned three days ago, what were you doing when the symptoms started? Are you aware of any triggers?

Uh not that I remember. What was I doing? I I was at home. I was working on my computer and yeah, I just felt like some nausea and I had to to vomit and then I had some diarrhea straight after that.

Yeah. Did you have any takeaway food or any dodgy restaurant food?

Uh not that I remember.

Okay. Have you been around anyone unwell with diarrhea recently? Last week or so?

Not that I know. No.

Okay. Okay. Um right, so moving on. Um are you otherwise fit and well?

Yeah. Yeah.

Uh okay, and do you take any regular medications?

Um so I I do suffer of asthma, so I do have my inhalers uh that I you know, I I I use infrequently, let's say, only when I have uh a bit of asthma.

Is that the blue inhaler?

Sorry?

Is that the blue inhaler?

Yes, it is. Yeah.

Blue inhaler. Okay. All right. Any other medications that you take?

Uh no, nothing.

Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medications?

Um not that I know of.

Okay. And any family history of any medical problems?

Uh so my father has high uh well, used to have high blood pressure. He actually so he actually died of bowel cancer like ten years ago.

Okay. Sorry to hear that. Um okay. And what about your mother?

Oh yes, so uh probably it's worth mentioning uh she has diabetes.

Diabetes. Do we know if that's type one or type two?

Uh it's type two.

Okay. All right. Fine. And um just a little bit more about your life in general, sir. Um who who is at home with you? Who lives at home with you?

Sorry?

Who lives at home with you, sir?

Oh, I I live alone.

You live alone. Okay. Are you currently working at the moment?

Uh well, I haven't been able to work in the past few days, but yes, like in in my

What's your employment? What do you do for work?

I'm a software engineer.

Software engineer. Okay. All right. Have you taken time off work recently?

Uh yes, yes, I have uh this last three days I've been feeling really unwell so I couldn't work.

Okay. All right. And just last couple of questions with regarding your smoking and alcohol. Do you do either of those?

Uh not really. I drink infrequently. Like socially, let's say. And I don't smoke.

Okay. All right. Um fine. So, Robert, um having listened to your story, I think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis.

Okay.

Which essentially is just a tummy bug. It's an infection of your your tummy. Um and normally lasts for about three to five days and gets better.

All right.

So things you can do to really help yourself get better soon, um are you can drink plenty of fluids, really try and flush the toxins out of your body.

Okay.

You can get things from the pharmacy which are called Dioralyte which can help replenish any minerals and vitamins you may have lost.

Sorry, what's the name of that?

It's called Dio Dioralyte. Um it it's uh it's a type of fluid replacement drink. Um you can take some Paracetamol if you're feeling feverish and weak. I would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for the next day or two until you get better. Normally you have to be diarrhea free for about 24 to 48 hours before you return back to work. Um let's see how the next few days go and if you're still not better next week, I want you to come back and see me and we can have another look at your symptoms, okay?

That sounds good. That sounds good. Uh thanks so much.

You have any questions for me or?

Um no, I think that's fine. Uh yeah, I'll I'll try to rest and drink plenty of fluid and I hope it goes away. Uh if it doesn't I'll I'll call I'll call back. Is that okay?

I really hope you get better soon.

Thanks a lot. Thanks so much for your time.

Bye bye.

Okay. Bye.
