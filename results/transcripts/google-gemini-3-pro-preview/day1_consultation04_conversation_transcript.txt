Alex? Oh. Hello. Hi, can you hear me?

Yeah.

Okay, great. Um, how can I help you this morning, sir?

Hi, so I've been feeling kind of uh under the weather for the past four days. Um, it started with a um sore throat and runny nose and it sort of um it's sort of going into a cough now. Um, the sore throat is kind of going away, but um I'm starting to cough.

Mmhmm. Okay.

And um just feeling kind of uh bad and tired.

Mmm. Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. Seems like there's a lot going on there. Um, so let's start with your your sore throat first. Um, tell me a bit more about that if you can.

Um, so I I, you know, I think I it all started with uh some colleague of mine she she just kept sneezing next to me all the time. I think her kids are catching something from the uh from their kindergarten or something. And uh, you know, that it it started as a normal sore throat and was quite painful for a couple of days but then it was passed.

Okay. Okay. And did you have any uh difficulty or pain on swallowing?

Um, yeah, yeah, it was uh it was quite painful to swallow for one of the days.

Okay. Did you man- did you manage to have a look in the back of your throat in the mirror?

Um, no, not really.

No. Okay. You didn't you didn't notice any abnormal white spots or redness at the back of your throat?

Um, no. I I didn't think about uh looking.

That's okay. That's okay. And you mentioned a runny nose. Um, again, what kind of discharge is coming out? Is it clear or is it a bit bit more colored?

Yeah, yeah, it's uh it's clear but it's uh sort of um sort of getting my nose stuffed all the time. It's very hard to uh to get it free.

Okay. So you feel quite congested, do you?

Yeah, quite congested.

Okay. Fine. Um, you also mentioned a cough as well. Can you tell me a bit more about that?

Um, yeah, that started recently like just uh um maybe yesterday. And um it's uh it's dry for now. It's not very painful but it's sort of there all the time.

Okay. And is it worse at any particular time of the day?

Sorry?

Is it is it worse at any particular time of the day? For example, in the evenings, nighttime, mornings?

Um...

Or is it throughout the day?

No, it's it's um it's sort of it's sort of constant.

Okay.

Um, I I forgot to mention that um I'm also having uh night sweats.

Night sweats. Okay.

Yeah, yes.

Okay. Um, right. Okay. Have you noticed any fevers or temperatures at all?

Um, I I had some some fever in the beginning, but it's now sort of uh going down. I I've been taking some paracetamol and ibuprofen for that and uh they they help.

That's very sensible. Um, very good. Um, in terms of your chest otherwise, have you had any difficulty breathing or any pain in your chest?

Um, so no pain in the chest, but uh I noticed that I um um so I feel a bit winded on exertion. So if I I haven't been going going to the gym just uh um because of that.

When you say winded do you feel uh do you feel more short of breath would you say on exertion? Is that what you mean?

Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. Um, and and that's mainly on exercise but when you're resting there's no problems?

Yeah, yeah, when when when I'm resting it's okay. So I've been actually going to work and sort of managing.

Okay. Fine. Just a couple of other questions sir if that's if you don't mind. Any pain in your in your ears at all?

Um, no.

No, you don't feel blocked or any discharge coming out of your ears?

No, I don't think so.

Okay. Fine. Um, what I'm going to do I'm just going to run through a few uh yes no questions if you if you don't mind, just uh review of your systems. Any any headaches at all?

Um, yeah. Yeah. That that's still that's still there.

Whereabouts are the head headaches?

Um, just sort of general. Um, and um they're not they're not always there but you know every now and then they would come and go.

Okay. And with these headaches have you had any problems with your with your eyesight, your vision?

Um, maybe a bit less than uh than what I would usually have.

Okay. Um, have you noticed any any funny rashes at all on your skin?

Um, no. No.

And any general muscle pain or aches? Joint pains or muscle pains?

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's sort of started in the past couple days.

Yeah. Okay. All right. Um, and uh just having a look at the rest of your history. Are you otherwise fit and well or do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of?

Um, so otherwise that uh I'm I'm fine. There's um there isn't anything that I'm taking or being treated for.

Okay. Um...

So you're otherwise fit and well. Uh, any any allergies at all to any medications I should be aware of?

Yeah.

Uh, do you know what type of diabetes it is? Is it type 1, type 2?

I think it's type 2. I think it's type 2.

Okay. Um, anything else which you think is significant?

Yeah, I I think um one of my uh great granddads had an eczema.

Eczema. Okay. Okay. Um, just moving on to what we say so- social history just get to know you a bit more as a person. Tell me who do you live with at home?

Oh, um, I live alone.

Okay. And you said you're working at the moment, is that right?

Yeah, yeah.

What do you do for work?

Um, I'm um I'm an accountant.

Okay. And how's your work going at the moment uh over the last has it has it been affecting your work?

Um, a little bit. I've been a bit slower and you know it's uh it's it's a bit of a stressful period just around the uh end of the year.

Mmm.

Right.

Okay. And is that stress is that affecting your um your mood at all in any in any way?

Um, no. I think I think it's it's the you know it's the good kind of stress. It's um...

Good stress. Okay.

It's good work.

Well if if there's anything you ever want to talk to me about you can always come and see me about your mood and stress anxiety we're happy to help.

No no. I I I like my job. It's just you know it's a bit more work than usual.

Okay. Okay. And just very briefly just in terms of smoking uh do you smoke at all?

Um, yeah occasionally you know cigars and things on company parties.

Okay so not not regular. Um, and what about alcohol?

Um, occasionally I would have some. Not a very big drinker.

Okay, socially with work is it?

Yeah.

Um, okay. Um, so um, sir, just having listened to your story, um, uh really just to summarize you know last four days you've been feeling generally quite unwell, sore throat, runny nose, bit of a dry cough, bit of muscle pain, weakness. Um, had an initial fever but now settled. Um, I don't think there's a lot to worry about. I think you probably just have you know a bit of a viral what we say viral upper respiratory tract infection or maybe early signs of a flu. Um, these normally last for about 7 to 10 days and just gets better really um over time. But things you can do to really help yourself um is get plenty of rest. I'll probably advise you taking a day or two off work if you can. Um, making yourself you know pushing fluids and making yourself well hydrated. Continuing with the regular paracetamol and ibuprofen. Um, and and we should see how things go really. Um, if next week you're still not better I'd like you to come back and see me. Um, is that clear? Is that does that make does that make...

Yeah. Yeah, that's that's that's all good. It makes sense. Uh I think I thought I'll take a couple days off...

Yeah.

and see how it goes.

And things to look out for if you're really not getting better if you if you have a high fever or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored or chest pain I'd like you to come back and see us much sooner. Give me a call. Um, and we we can help you out, okay?

Yeah, yeah, understood. I'll uh I'll take care.

Great. Have a great day. Good luck with your work.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you. You too.

Bye bye.

Bye bye.
