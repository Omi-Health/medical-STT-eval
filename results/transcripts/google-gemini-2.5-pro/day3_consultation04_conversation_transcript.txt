Hi.
Hi. Hello. I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please?
Yes, my name is.
And your date of birth?
The 14th of June, 1996.
And your address for me, please.
And 28 Quicks Road, SW19 1EZ.
That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation.
Thank you.
Okay. So, you mentioned in in our notes that you've got some tightness. If you could tell me a bit more about it, please.
Yeah, so about two to three days ago, I was running with a friend and usually I could talk to her whilst I ran, but I found myself actually short of breath. Um I'm not really short of breath when I'm walking. Um but definitely um if I'm walking briskly now. Um and I've used my blue inhaler but to no avail. It hasn't really helped me.
Okay. So yeah. So I'm having, I'm just wheezing a bit and coughing and just generally a bit short of breath.
Wheezing and coughing. Okay. And you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler, so how often are you using the blue inhaler?
Um I think I'm just using it as and when I have symptoms.
Yeah. So, um at the moment you are having shortness of breath. So are you using it every day at the moment?
Um yeah and morning and evening to kind of prevent it as well.
Okay. And um what which color? What's the name of your preventer?
Um it's a blue. Um, I think in totality, um my history is salbutamol, clenil, cetraben and hydrocortisone that I'm taking as well.
Okay. So could you repeat that? Your salbutamol, clenil...
Uh, cetraben and hydrocortisone.
And hydrocortisone. So you have eczema also, yeah?
What's that, sorry?
You do have a history of eczema?
Um my brother's asthmatic and my sister has eczema. Um and I've got a few issues um that I think could be eczema as well.
Okay. Right. So coming back to your um you know, your shortness of breath. You've mentioned you're wheezy and you're coughing. Are you bringing up any phlegm at all?
Um no, I don't um I'm not coughing up much sputum.
Okay, no sputum. Okay.
Right to you. And um how are you using your um your clenil? So are you using it every day?
Um I think I'm using that every day and the salbutamol just like as and when.
So how are you using the clenil? Is it twice a day?
Um yes.
Okay. And have you ever been admitted in hospital because your asthma was so bad?
Um no, I haven't.
Okay.
Right here. When was the last time you had an asthma attack?
Um about three to four years ago.
Three to four years ago. And what what did the GP do at that time?
Um just um encouraged me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative.
Okay. So you didn't have any steroids, oral steroids, or antibiotics?
Not that I can remember.
Okay. Okay. Right. Have you ever had oral steroids in the past?
Um no.
When was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse?
Um about two years ago.
Okay, two years ago.
Okay. But your asthma was pretty under control till till now, isn't it?
Uh yes, just in the last two to three days.
So, do you do a peak flow meter at home? Peak flow reading where you blow into, you know.
Do you do that now?
Um just every now and then. I haven't done it over the last since I've had symptoms.
Okay. So what was what's your peak flow reading when you're good?
Like normally, peak flow reading.
Um I think 100... 130?
Okay, let's say it's about um 380, yeah?
Yeah.
Okay.
Right. So that's your normal, yeah? Right here. Okay. So what we need...
Okay. Do you have any allergies at all?
Um I have hay fever.
Sorry, could you repeat that, please?
Sorry, I have hay fever.
Hey. Okay. No no any allergies to medication?
Oh, no, sorry.
Okay. So you're not allergic to anything. Okay.
So no allergies. Okay. Excellent. Right here. So what we need to do that, obviously, we you haven't had an asthma check for some time and it looks like you can be having a small small exacerbation. So what I would like you to be seen by one of our GPs in the next few days. In the interim, what I'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when. Okay? You can use it maximum about every two to four four hours, but if you're using it that often, that means pretty much that, you know, your asthma's really bad. You can use it, but that's not ideal. The blue, uh the brown, your clenil, the brown inhaler, you can up the dose if you're using just two puffs twice a day, you can increase it to four puffs twice a day. Yeah? And while this is to do while you're waiting to see us.
Now, as mentioned, you know, you're doing, you know, increase the clenil to four puffs twice a day and you're using the asthma, you know, the blue inhalers every two to four hours, and your breathing's getting really worse, then you would need to take yourself to A&E. You shouldn't wait for our appointment. Okay? So when doctor sees you, what we're going to do is we're going to examine your chest, yeah? Make you do the peak flow reading. So depending on what we find, you might need some antibiotics or some steroids. But anyway, while you're at home, we are going to by increasing your clenil, we are increasing your steroid intake anyway.
Okay.
So, yeah. So, any questions you wanted to ask me?
Am I...?
Yeah, so book an appoint- call support, book an appointment to see, and I will recommend that we do it face-to-face. In the interim, increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly, but if your breathing's getting worse and you've not seen us, do take yourself to A&E. All right?
Okay.
Okay. Thank you so much for your time.
You're welcome. Take care then. Bye bye. Bye. Bye.
