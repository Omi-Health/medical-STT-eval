Hi, I'm Dr.
Hello, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon.
How are you doing?

Yeah. So just before we we start, is it all right if you could confirm your full name for me, please?
Yes. Maria Trabolotza.

Okay. And your email address for me, please.

Okay. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation.
Yes, I think I am, yeah.
Good.
Right. You've mentioned in your in your patient notes that you're having some sort of lip swelling and after you had a sandwich?
Is that correct?
Yeah, that is well, I don't think I don't think it was it wasn't a sandwich, but it was it was something with prawns. So, basically, I I sometimes go with my friends to to this place called Fat Fuck. And we we regularly have like usually I have like a normal vegetarian soup or something. And yeah, and then I wanted to try something new. Um, so what happened was
I I ordered a prawn soup. It's it's it's it's called a laksa, it's like a soup. I ordered a prawn one this time.
Yeah.
And yeah, and then my lips start like my lips started feeling a little weird just in the in the corner sort of on the left first. And then I don't know, and then we went back, we had a little bit of a chat of banter. I wasn't really paying attention. Uh now I feel that that there is a swelling.
Yeah.
There is like a swelling on my on my upper lip and it's kind of getting bigger. I don't know what to do.
Right. So, when did you have the prawn soup? What time?
That was that must have been just after work. So maybe like around 7:00.
Okay. Around 7 o'clock. And um how long did it take to develop the swelling?
Well, I wasn't really paying attention, so it must have been like must have been like I don't know, half an hour maybe.
Okay, in half an hour you developed the swelling, yeah?
Yeah.
Okay, and it's getting bigger and bigger.
Yeah, it's it's it's I can still feel it like really pumping blood and it's kind of getting bigger, it feels like it's getting worse.
Okay. So, just a few more questions. Um, so you've mentioned about your swelling of your lips. Is there any feeling of swelling in in your throat? Like your throat is closing up, any feeling like that?
Yeah, actually, I I feel like I can't breathe that well right now.
Okay.
And do you feel like like your chest is tight?
I don't know if it's the chest, it just generally feels a little difficult.
Okay.
But yeah, it might be. I'm not sure.
Okay. Right.
And just a few have you ever had these any kind of lip swelling in the past after eating any food?
Yeah, well, maybe. I remember like a year ago, a year ago I was out with my friends. And I think we went like to a late night kind of Chinese place and I remember that I was quite drunk to be honest. And I remember that after like having that very late, I woke up the next morning quite swollen up and had also like
Okay.
felt really bad and quite difficult breathing. But I'm not sure what it was I had. It was like a curry or something.
Okay.
Uh and what did you take at that time? Did you use anything like antihistamine or anything when you had that last time?
Well, I generally have asthma, so I take I I take uh what's it called? Salbutamol inhalers?
Yeah.
Yeah. So I do take that regularly, but I've always taken it. I generally have asthma.
And any other inhalers? Is it just the Salbutamol that you use? Any other brown inhalers?
Uh, no, I don't think so, no.
Okay. Right. And um, so do you use antihistamines like cetirizine, loratadine, piriton, any of those kind of things?
No. Well, well, I do sometimes but I don't know which ones. So I have a peanut allergy as well.
Yeah.
Like I've always had it.
Yeah.
And I think I do get antihistamines for that, but I'm not sure which ones.
And any point because you've had peanutology, any time you had to ever use like an injection?
When I was a kid, I think I remember my mom told me about it, but I don't know what it was because I was small and I changed doctors since.
Right. Has your mom ever said that you had to go to hospital because you had a severe allergic reaction?
Yeah, as a when I was like six or something, I I I think Oh my swelling is getting. Oh my god. Oh, yeah, I think when I was
Are you right? Are you okay now?
I feel really dizzy right now, to be honest.
You feel dizzy. Okay. Right. Do you have any kind of uh antihistamines with you at the moment?
No, I don't think I have.
Okay. Right. Okay. So
I don't think so.
Right. All all right. I I am really a bit worried about you at the moment, Maria. um, I think we need to call an ambulance because um from what history you've been telling me, it sounds like you could be going into what we say an anaphylactic reaction. That's when your throat and your chest, you know, closes in and you might need an injection like what your mom's, you know, what your mom told you as you were a young child.
Okay. Right. So is there any anyone with you at the moment or are you alone?
I'm alone at the moment.
Okay. So hang on the line while I'll call the ambulance, okay? And I'll send them right to you. Okay? And
Somebody just came. Somebody just came, yes. I'm not alone anymore.
All right. Okay, somebody just came. So just call the ambulance, make sure that person's with you till the ambulance comes. Yeah? Um and because we are worried about an anaphylactic reaction, so you need to go straight away. Could you ask the person whether they have any antihistamines around in the interim? While we're waiting.
Yes. Uh Mom, Mom, do we have any antihistamines around?
Yes.
Yes. Oh yeah, yeah, we do.
Take that straight away and if mom can call, mom, if you can call the 999999, yeah? And say that you there is a suspected anaphylactic reaction and they need to come straight away.
Okay?
Yes, she says she will, yes.
So straight away take the antihistamines in the meantime. All right?
Okay, okay. Yes.
And after you come up from the hospital, do give us a ring back. We might need to sort you out um with your injections and things like that. Okay?
Yes, yes. We'll do. Yes.
Okay then. Take care.
Thank you very much.
Bye bye. Bye. Bye bye.
