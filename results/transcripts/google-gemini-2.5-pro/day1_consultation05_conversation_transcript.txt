Hello.
Hi.
Good morning Kim. Um, how can I help you this morning?
Um, so I'm
having some some pain in my tummy, like the lower part of my tummy.
Okay.
Um and I've just been feeling quite hot and sweaty.
Right. I'm sorry to hear that. When when did your symptoms all start?
About two days ago.
Okay. And where abouts in your tummy is the pain exactly?
Uh, like below my belly button. It's like quite sore when I press on it.
Okay. Did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual?
It was slow. It hasn't been, it's more gradual and it's just, it's getting a bit worse now.
Okay. Okay. And can you describe the pain to me?
Uh, it's kind of like a, I guess a burning pain, uh, and it's just right there in that spot. Like, that's mostly where I'm feeling it. It hasn't spread anywhere else.
Just in, just below your belly button you mentioned.
Yeah.
Okay. Um, and is the pain constant or does it come and go?
It's pretty constant. It's like getting worse. Um, it's not like, I can still move and walk around. Uh, I mean, I'm still kind of functioning. It's just, uh, I'm aware of it all the time.
Mhm. Okay. Um and with that pain, have you noticed any other symptoms at all? So for example, let's let's focus firstly on your bowels. Are your bowels working okay?
Yeah, I had a bit of constipation, but that's better now. That was like since last week.
Okay, so you've got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose stools?
No. My bowel movements are normal now.
Okay. And what about your waterworks? Are you passing urine okay?
Yeah, I'm that's fine. I did notice that I was a little, the urine was a little pink in color, but I haven't like, it hasn't really been burning specifically or hurting when I pee and uh, and I did notice I was going to the, I was peeing more regularly, but I have been drinking lots of fluids, so I wasn't sure, um, I wasn't sure, um, you know, if that was related to the pain.
When you mentioned pink urine, do was there any blood at all in your urine, or is it difficult to say?
I can't say. I mean, maybe.
Okay. All right. But otherwise, it doesn't hurt or or or sting when you pass urine?
I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that. Um, just that I'm peeing more than I've, more regularly.
Okay. Um, okay. And um moving up towards other symptoms, have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all?
Just a little nauseous, um, but no vomiting.
No vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers?
I haven't, I felt a bit hot and sweaty, but I haven't really measured it, so I can't really say.
Okay, fine. Um and Kim, just have to ask, um uh, you know, all all all female patients this this question is about your cycle, if you don't mind me asking. Um, are you currently um, are you currently sexually active?
Uh yeah, I've had the same partner. I am, we were last sexually active about four days ago. Uh, my last STD screen was normal, which was about six months ago.
Okay. So you've had no other partners since then?
No other partners since then.
Okay. Um, uh, and do you use any contraception at all?
Um, on the Implanon. I had the Implanon inserted about a year ago.
Implanon. Okay, fine. Um, are you still having periods?
Yes.
When was your last period?
Uh, my last period was about three weeks ago. I mean, two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago. Okay. So, is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an Implanon in but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? It's something for us to think about, potentially.
Well, we don't use any other barrier methods, so we just use the, I just have the Implanon and the same partner. Um, theoretically if the Implanon hasn't been working, then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect it.
Okay. Well, it's something for us to think about. Um, uh, maybe worth doing a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that. Um, okay. And and so just to summarize so far, if you don't mind. It's really for the last couple of days, this tummy pain has really affected you, mainly lower down towards your belly button. It's quite burning, you said, it's getting worse. Um, you know, some pink urine, um, but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine. Your bowels are working okay. You've felt a little bit nauseous, um, and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right?
Yeah, that sounds very accurate.
Is there anything else perhaps that you feel like you should share with me at this stage, which you think might be important?
I don't think so. I think we've we've covered everything that's really bothering me.
Yeah, okay. Um, tell tell me a bit more about your um, medical history otherwise. Are you normally fit and well?
Yeah, I'm quite well. I haven't had any surgical, I don't have any surgical history. I don't have any previous, I haven't had any operations before or, and I'm not on any other medication. I just have the Implanon.
Okay. Um, have you had anything like this before in the past, any similar symptoms?
I've never had, I've never had these symptoms before.
No. Okay. Um, fine. Um, any other family history I should be aware of? Anything relevant, family uh related to the bowels, maybe related to gynae history?
No, not that, not that I'm aware of now.
Okay, all right. Um, and socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you?
Uh, I live in a share house, um, with three other, two other roommates.
Okay. Um, and uh, are you currently working?
Yeah, I currently, I am currently working.
What do you do for work?
I'm an accountant.
Okay. Um,
Great. Okay. Um, do you smoke at all, Kim?
No.
No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
I, socially I drink, but uh, I don't think more more than normal.
No. Okay.
Okay. Um, just before I go into examination, I want to go through just some few screening questions if that's okay, yes or no. Uh we've we've covered the majority of them already, um, but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else. Um, how's your, how's your chest? How's your breathing? Um, anything?
I don't feel short of breath or I'm not having any problems or I don't have a cough or anything that's worrying me.
Okay. Any funny heartbeats or rhythms, palpitations?
Not that, no.
Okay. Any headaches, any problems with your vision?
No.
No. Okay, all right. Um, fine. Okay. Um, so really just, um, moving on, um, so based, based on your story really, uh, Kim, it's it's a, it's a difficult one. It's it's it's um, we know you've got some tummy pain. We don't exactly know what's causing it. It could be a few different things that could be causing your pain. Could just be a, you know, it could just be a urine infection, for example. Could just be something related to your gut. Um, could this be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy related cause? Um, and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out um, what's going on here. Um, which I can organize for you today.
Okay.
Um, and the based on those tests, we'll we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed. But certainly if if if it's been going on for the last couple of days, um, uh, you know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for maybe a urine infection, um, so with some
Can we do that instead of me going for tests and then seeing how that goes?
Yeah, absolutely. So, um, I think it's certainly worth, you know, covering you with some antibiotics today. Uh, but I still want you to bear in mind, you know, having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here. And um, and I want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time if your symptoms are not getting any better or indeed if they're getting worse. So things to look out for would be, you know, worsening tummy pain. Um if you're feeling really hot and sweaty and the temperature's not coming down. Um, vomiting, etcetera. Does that make sense?
Yeah, I think I'm happy with that plan.
Okay. Um, you can try just regular painkillers, uh, paracetamol will be advisable. Um, make sure you drink plenty of fluids. You can try some cranberry juice as well, which can sometimes help with your urine symptoms. Um, take the antibiotics, and give me a call, you know, if you are worried about anything else.
Uh sure. That sounds great. Thank you very much. Um, should I just collect the script at my pharmacy?
Yep, I'll send it straight to your pharmacy. Start the antibiotics today, something called trimethoprim. Um we'll take two tablets, uh one tablet twice a day for three days.
Okay, great. That sounds great.
Let's see how you get on.
Okay, thank you very much.
Great. All the best.
Bye.
Bye bye.
