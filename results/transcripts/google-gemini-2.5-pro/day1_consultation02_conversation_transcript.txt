Hello.
Hello.
Can you hear me well?
Uh, yes, I think it's a bit better. It's a bit it's a bit it's not very clear, but let's continue anyway.
Okay.
Okay, let's start again. So how can I help you, sir?
Yes, so it's been a few days now. I have like a sore and a red skin. It's kind of it's really itchy and it's like super annoying. So I'd like to find something quick to solve it.
No, no problems. I'm happy to help. Um, whereabouts in your skin is it affected?
Uh, mostly like my chest, my my hands, my arms, like like really it's it's super annoying, like it's itching a lot, like all the time and I can't even sleep at night. Like I really need something quickly to to solve it because even at work I like um, when I'm in a meeting and I have to like uh think about my work and focus, like actually focus on my work, it's really annoying because I can't actually think about uh what I have to say. I'm always like uh disturbed by by this disease.
No, no, okay, I understand this is obviously affecting you and uh we'll try our very best to get get it sorted out for you. Um, have you had anything like this before in the past?
Um, so, yes, uh earlier I was like prescribed for my eczema.
Okay.
And they gave me like some cream and something to uh when I like was shower uh when I was in the shower, I had to put something.
Okay.
But um yeah.
Did they help?
Um, I mean, at that time, yes, but those symptoms, like these symptoms like when these symptoms appeared again, I tried those and it didn't work. I've tried a few things, like I bought like a steroid cream at the pharmacy last night, but it apparently didn't help because it's still itching a lot today.
Okay.
Yeah.
Do you remember the name of the cream you bought?
Uh, steroid cream.
Okay, steroid. Okay. Uh that's okay. Um do would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different?
Um, it's much more like itchy and my eczema was more like only in the arms and now it's also on the chest and in the and the on the hands as well.
Okay.
Yeah, when like I like for instance hiking during the weekend and I I can't really do it anymore because it's like very like like I wanted to do that last weekend and it was super painful and I think I have to take like showers every day to be able to kind of ease this itching part, which is very very annoying.
No, well well okay, that's okay. So you mentioned the itchiness. Um you also mentioned it's been quite sore. Um have you noticed any uh bleeding or discharge from your skin?
No. Um, so my skin is a bit cracked in some parts, like kind of cracked if you see what I mean.
Okay.
But uh yeah.
Have you noticed any any other uh pus or blood coming out of your skin?
No.
No. And you mentioned it all started three days ago?
Four days ago.
Four days ago. Four days ago. Are you aware of any triggers, so anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start? So for example, have you changed your shower gel, any clothing? Have you been around anyone else?
No, I haven't. It's actually like it's really annoying because I'm thinking about maybe I should change something because I I haven't and I don't understand and I'm kind of um afraid of asking people around me because it's kind of, you know, um I don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions. It's kind of intimate and so I really need your help now.
Mm, no, no. Okay, that's okay. Um, fine. So just to re-summarize, for the last four days you've had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, mainly your chest. And did you also mention your arms and legs as well?
Uh, no, just the chest, hands and like like inside the elbows.
Okay. And anything on your face at all?
In my what?
On your face?
On my face, no.
No. Okay. And apart from this, any other symptoms have you noticed? For example, have you noticed any temperature or fevers?
No, just the itching.
Itching.
Nothing else.
Okay. So your your bowels are working okay. Your chest is okay, no cough, no breathing difficulties.
No.
You're passing urine okay?
Uh, I think so.
Okay. All right. Um it's always good to know so I mean, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms?
Any what?
Any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms?
Um, I so I had eczema before, so maybe it's this but it seems like more uh like uh my eczema was only on the arms, so I'm I'm not sure. I I really have no idea.
Okay. Now it's okay. So um normally at this stage I'd like to examine you. Um to see the rash itself and see exactly what type of rash it is. But from what you've told me, you mentioned it's you've got some dry skin and some uh cracked skin as well. Uh and it's been very itchy. And so with your um uh your your background of eczema, um sorry, so there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you which I completely forgot. My apologies. Um apart from the eczema, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of?
Uh, no, I just had asthma in the past, but not anymore.
Okay.
Not anymore. Okay. And do you take any regular medications at the moment?
Uh, no.
No. Okay. Do you have any allergies to anything?
I Sorry, yeah.
Sorry, I was going to say do you have any allergies to anything?
Hello.
Hello, yes.
Oh can you hear me? Uh sorry I think it cracked. Um do you have any allergies at all?
Oh, allergies, uh, no.
No, okay. Um, and tell me about your um your situation at home, who do you live with?
Uh, so I live with a few flatmates. I'm a so you know I'm 31. Uh, I yeah, I have a full-time job and so I'm living with a few people to save money.
Okay, and what do you do for work?
Uh, I work at a pharmaceutical company. So it's been uh it's been a few years now. Uh, it's uh it's kind of interesting. We're working I'm a like a kind of project manager. Uh, I mean do you want to to know more about it?
Okay.
Uh no, no, no, that's absolutely that's absolutely fine. Um, just a couple of questions I want to ask you which can sometimes affect your symptoms is do you smoke at all?
No.
No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
Uh, you know, once in a while I can I like hanging out with people once in a while, so yeah, I'd say a few a few beers per week, something like this. Nothing nothing crazy. I used to drink a lot more when I was younger, but it's been it's been a while.
Okay.
Okay. I've got to say at this stage I've got to say this sound quality is not uh great but I I will continue because we've come this far. Um so um based on everything you mentioned sir, I I do wonder whether this is a flare up of your eczema. Um the reason being that you said it's quite itchy, um it's mainly affecting your chest and your back. Um and uh having looked at your skin, uh the rash does appear quite familiar. Um you mentioned using steroid creams yesterday um from the pharmacy. I wonder whether giving you stronger prescription of a of a steroid may be beneficial. Which I'm happy to prescribe to you today. As well as I'm going to give you something some emollients which helps to moisturize the skin um which you can also use in the bath and shower. And it's definitely worth um using that for the first seven to 10 days uh before we make a decision on whether it's working or not. Um it's also worth um using antihistamines which you can sometimes buy over the counter, things like Loratadine or Piriton which can help with the itchiness of your skin. And uh it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap because if that's causing your symptoms and we need to have a discussion about that next time I see you.
Okay, just I I have tried antihistamines uh lately but it didn't really help.
Oh, could you say it again, sorry?
I have tried the antihistamines.
Okay.
But it didn't really help.
It didn't, okay. So it's something for you to think about. You can get different type of antihistamines. I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well. Um something like Fexofenadine which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying it, it's not going to do you any harm. Um but I certainly think using the steroids and the emollients um on a regular basis uh over the next week to 10 days should hopefully control your symptoms. But do come back and see me next week if things don't get better.
That sounds good.
Okay.
Um, do you have any questions for me?
Uh, no, that's it.
Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Have a good day.
Bye. Thank you, doctor. Bye.
