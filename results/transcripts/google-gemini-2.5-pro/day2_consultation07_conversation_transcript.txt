Okay, fantastic. So, um, how can I help you today? Um, yeah, I was I was having, um, a bit of chest discomfort. So I was doing some gardening, um, a couple of hours ago, and I felt not exactly a pain, but, um, like a a pressure on my chest. Um, it feels like someone's sitting on my chest. Um, and I've noticed, um, a bit of nausea, not no vomiting, but, um, I'm pretty sweaty, um, short of breath, and it kind of feels like someone's sitting on my chest. Right, okay. Now, do you have those these symptoms right now, or have they gone off now? Um, no, they're still present. Okay. So you've still got the chest discomfort right now. Yes. Okay. Um, we're probably going to have to call an ambulance for you. To take you to hospital. Okay? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to task my colleague next to me to sort that out. While we do a bit more information to the the ambulance team when they when they arrive, okay? Sure. So just to just to double check, um, where exactly in the chest is the pain? Um, it's in the, uh, middle of my chest. Um, over, uh, yeah, my my pecs. So, um, yeah, but not not necessarily to one side. And it's quite a diffuse pain. Right. Is it spreading anywhere else, like down to your arm, up to the jaw, and the neck, anything like that? Yeah, it's it's, um, mainly in my left arm. Uh, it's feeling a little bit, um, uh, painful, and and in my shoulder as well. Right. Okay. Do you remember what you were doing at the time? Uh, yeah, so it started, uh, just when I was gardening.

Have you had this before? No, this is the first time actually. Right, okay. Yeah. Um, are you aware of any palpitations, like your heart beating faster or more prominently than normal? Um, yeah, it's it's beating a bit faster now. I think that's because I'm a little bit stressed, um, about the situation, but I haven't noticed it, um, beating faster than usual, um, today. So, I know you're stressed. We've got an ambulance coming on the way. Okay? So, um, we'll take care of everything. So don't don't worry. Anyone in the house with you at the moment?

Um, I've I sometimes even have it and it's it's a it's a mild reaction to it. Okay. All right. It's very important that you communicate that to the hospital. Okay. That detail you've just told me because, um, we we may need to consider aspirin despite, okay? Um, all right. Um, now in terms of, um, what happens from here, the team will assess you and then they may take you in to one hospital or another based on how bad or what the ECG looks like and what kind of treatment you might need, okay?
