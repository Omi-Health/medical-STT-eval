Uh, no issues, nothing like out of the ordinary there.
Okay, so there's no problems with your blood pressure control at the moment, even though you're not, okay, so that's okay, that's absolutely fine. And when was the last time you took your blood pressure?
Uh, I've been this morning.
This morning? And what was what was the readings like?
I can't remember off the top of my head, but it was within the normal range.
So it was, there was nothing alarming, yeah? Normal.
Okay. Absolutely fine.
Okay. So that seems all right. Okay, so, um, can I hypothetically, look into your mouth, yeah?
Sure. Yeah?
Okay. So I just Yeah. Okay. So, uh, looking into your mouth, um, you know, there's just a bit mild redness at the back of your throat. Um there's no enlarged tonsils. Can you feel any glands around your neck at all?
No. No, I haven't had anything like that.
Okay. So, it looks like it's just a viral infection, um, because it's just a cold and a cough, there's nothing there. And generally if you have things like a chest infection, you would have a bit like a wheeze or shortness of breath. So, um, things that we would recommend is you can use the, you know, night nurse, day nurse. It's still okay with your medications, yeah? So I'm I'm sure you were a bit wary to use them, but it's still okay with your current medication, you can still use that. Might be able to make you feel a bit more better quickly. If there's any change, like you're feeling short of breath, or the your symptoms are lasting more than three weeks or something, or you're becoming poorly, uh, things like that, then you need to get in touch with us, then probably we might need to examine you and especially your chest, but I don't think so that's necessary at this point in time.
Okay, that sounds good.
Okay. Any questions at all?
Uh, no, I I I think that's that's been very helpful. Thank you.
Okay. So just to round it up, just use the night night nurse, day nurse. If any change in your symptoms, like shortness of breath, wheezy, or symptoms are lasting more than three weeks, then get in touch with us.
Okay, so I don't need any prescription or anything like that?
No, no, you don't need anything at the moment.
Okay.
Okay. Take care then.
Thank you very much.
