Hello, can you hear me okay?
Hey, yes, I can. Can you hear me?
Yeah, good, good. So my name is Joe. I'm a doctor um here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please?
Hey, my name's Vincent.
And your date of birth?
Uh...
Uh, 9th of May 2016.
Okay, great. Sorry. And are you in a uh a safe place? Oh sorry, a safe and conf- confidential place to talk and just have to go ahead with the consultation?
Yes, yes I am.
Great. So how can I help?
Yeah, so I have a cold. I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week and it's been causing me problems. I've had to stay away from work for about three or four of those days because of how bad it's been.
Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week.
And what came... what came first?
Uh the sore throat came first and then after a day or two, the cough.
Okay, okay. And uh are you coughing up anything?
No, it's very dry.
Okay. So I'm just going to ask a few questions about the uh your current symptoms and then a little bit about your background, um and something else about what we can do uh a little bit later on in the consultation to help you. Before I go on, is there anything you're particularly concerned about, um or have any ideas what might be going on? You said that you had a cold.
Well, well, I mean, you you know how we all are. Once this happens, you Google it and it seems to be all kinds of bad things. It could be, it could be... it could be a cold or a flu, obviously, it could also be tuberculosis, it could be cancer always comes up, so it'd be good if it's none of those.
Right. So, so yeah, I can provide a little bit of reassurance, um, and uh we can talk about those a little bit as well. And was there anything you were particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation?
Uh... well, yeah, some reassurance, so like hopefully some sense that it's not anything too serious, but also if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better or any advice or maybe even a sick note so that if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer I can get one.
Sure, sure. Okay. All right. So we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms and I'm sure we can get a um those things... sick note and some reassurance um about your concerns. So, um you mentioned that you started with a sore throat about a week ago, developed into a bit of a dry cough. Um, I'll just ask a few questions around those. So um do you have any shortness of breath?
Yes, yes, I've been having shortness of... Yeah, I've been having shortness of breath, yeah.
You are short of breath. And uh do you have any wheeze or chest pain?
Uh, yeah, a bit of both, I think.
You're you're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well?
Yes.
Okay. And how uh when did you start to develop the shortness of breath?
Let's see, so so so the sore throat, so today is Friday. Sore throat was about last week Friday or Thursday. Cough was Saturday or Sunday. So the so the shortness of breath was I think shortly after the cough, so maybe a day or two later, so three or four days ago.
Three or four days ago that you started developing... And is the cough worse at nighttime?
No. No, it's the same throughout the whole day.
Same throughout the day. Um, and uh when you say you're short of breath, just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are. So are you able to to um so like walk up a flight of stairs, for example, um or or are you short of breath at rest?
Uh yeah, it's it's like when I'm doing walking, um, and I do exercise now and then, so it hasn't been super bad, like it hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual and a little bit worrying.
And you're a bit concerned about that. Okay. So I just need to ask a few uh things about your background as well. So um do you have any other medical conditions or medical history?
No, just no no past medical history, no.
No past medical... No history of asthma?
No.
Um and any uh uh history of uh clots on your legs or your lungs? These DVTs or PEs. Uh no one in your family's had those, clots in the legs or lungs?
Well, my mother had lung cancer.
Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke?
No.
Have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos that you know of?
Don't know about asbestos, ever smoked, you know, I mean, once or twice in Amsterdam if that counts, but not really.
Okay. Um, and uh this so just going back to the your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough, it's a dry cough, no you're not coughing up any phlegm. Um, do do you have uh and you you say you don't have any chest pain as such. Um, uh, are you taking any medications currently at the moment?
Uh, no, I'm not.
Okay. Are you allergic to any medications?
Not to any medication, but I'm allergic to peanuts.
Peanuts. Okay. Um and uh... You mentioned that your mother had lung cancer. Um any other family history of any significant illnesses uh running running in your family?
No, no, that's the only one. Just lung cancer from my mother.
Just lung cancer. Okay. And you say you have a cold, so do you have sinus congestion or um...
No, it seems to be all almost entirely with just my throat, like not my nose is runny or anything like that.
So just just your just your throat and any recent travel or have you always lived in the UK?
Uh, no, so I I I haven't always lived in the UK, like so I was born in the US and moved over about 12 years ago, but in terms of recent travel just to Europe, nowhere too exotic.
Okay, so no so no recent travel, no significant recent travel anywhere. Um, okay. And are you coughing up anything other than um so you you're not coughing up blood or anything like that? No. No. Um, good. And uh are you feeling feverish, hot, cold, sweaty?
Yeah, so a little bit feverish um at first, so the first three or so days of this, but then the fever's gone away.
Okay. And in general do you... Sorry. Yeah.
Yeah, I was just going to say I also had a bit of a headache. Uh like headaches that come and go rather but like right now it's fine.
Okay. And in general would you say you're feeling you're you're beginning to to feel better, worse or or sort of um staying the same?
So it's like it's up and down. So, so let's see, so I it started last week and I stayed home from work two days this week. I think it was maybe Tuesday and then Thursday, so like I felt better and then worse again and then better and then worse again. So it's been yeah, like kind of constant but constant in being variable, if that makes sense.
Okay. And I just need to ask any other sort of risk factors um that you may have. So um no sort of significant weight loss, um or unexplained weight loss, any...
So no weight loss, but I have been I have been losing my appetite recently and I mean I usually eat a lot, so I enjoy eating as well. But like so that's been a bit concerning.
You've been losing your appetite recently.
Yes.
And you're a little bit concerned about that. But you haven't you haven't lost any weight that you think of?
No, not that.
And any um sort of rashes or anything uh and you...
No, no rash.
Not anything you can think of. Okay. Um, so I would ask to examine you now but um I I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat at least to see if there's a probably...
We can try it.
Oh no, well, no, it's okay. I might think about doing that. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck that you can feel?
Uh... No.
Not the no. Okay. Um, and so finally you you were talking about uh I mean it sounds to me that um you've been a little bit up and down, sore throat, developed a dry cough. Um, you are slightly short of breath but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of the consultation now, is if you feel significantly worse, um uh if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness, um or breathlessness that you are concerned about, then I would advise you to seek medical attention again, see a GP, um and actually see somebody physically. Um uh but I think for now I can sort of uh try and reassure you that um if this clears up as I expect it would. So I expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days. Um, if it's not, please get in touch with a medical professional again. Um, and uh I would expect it to, and so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis. Um, your concerns about lung cancer are... was that the other thing you were concerned about?
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. So, so, um, again, if you're not getting better, please see somebody again. Um, I've just got four seconds now. So nice talking to you and I think we got to we got to tidy it up, yeah. Okay. So, um...
Uh and I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days off work. Um and paracetamol, lots of fluids. Um and uh rest up. And as I say, if you're not feeling better, please get in touch.
Okay?
All right. Cheers a lot.
Have a good day.
Thank you.
Bye.
