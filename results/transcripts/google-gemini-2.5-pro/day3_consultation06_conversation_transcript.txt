Okay, she's listening. I'll get her to call now. Yeah.
Yeah. So, I'll ask her to give you that um antihistamine in the meantime, while the ambulance is coming, and take yourself to hospital. Uh, it might just be an urticarial react reaction, but because you're complaining of breathing difficulties, it is quite important that you go to hospital straight away. But I'd like you to call the ambulance because, you know, so that you'll be sorted out quickly.
