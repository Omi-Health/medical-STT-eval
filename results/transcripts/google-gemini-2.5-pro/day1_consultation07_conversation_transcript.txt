Hello.
Hello.
Hello. Can you hear me okay?
Yes, yeah, I can. Okay, cheers.
Great. Right, how can I help you this afternoon, sir?
Uh, I am not feeling very well.
I'm sorry.
And I haven't been feeling well for a good few days now, and I'm really hoping you can do something about it because it's been bugging me for a while now.
Well, I'll certainly try my best for you. Um, can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on?
Uh, I just feel a bit run down, you know, I've got a cough, a cold, you know, mostly been nagging me. I just, it's just all, yeah, it's just that's it, that's it.
Well, let's start with your cough first. Tell me a bit more about your cough. Is it, for example, are you coughing up anything at all? Or is it mainly dry?
Uh, yeah, yeah, I mean mostly dry. It's a, you know, it's a wee bit, in the morning it's a bit worse. Uh, but I mean, you know, it's it's fairly, fairly dry.
So you're not bringing up any mucky phlegm?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't like to admit that, it's, you know, not something I like to talk about, but yeah, it's, so wee bit, wee bit mucky, yeah.
Yeah. Okay, I certainly hear you've got the sniffles. So you a bit of a, a bit of a runny nose you mentioned.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I, I, you're right. Is that, is that coming through loud and clear on the phone, yeah?
Sorry to hear that, yeah, no...trouble.
Um, and uh, any other symptoms for example, have you had any, any sore throats, any ear pain?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've I've had a bit of a sore throat. I mean, you know, I'm doing a lot of uh, you know, watching the watching the football as well, so I do a lot of shouting at that, but I'm not sure if that's related or not.
Okay. Who do you support?
Uh, well it's a team called Partick Thistle and they're in the, they're not even in the top division of the Scottish League, they're actually in the, the, the Championship, which is the league below that, and they're bottom of the table.
Right.
So I've been shouting myself a wee bit hoarse because the performance has been, uh, pretty shite if I'm being honest with you.
That sounds fascinating. We'll wish them all the best.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
the table. Um, so so you mentioned a sore throat. Have you had a chance to look in the, in the mirror? Have you had a look at the back of your throat?
I mean I, I mean I shave every day, so I'm, I'm looking at myself. It's not, not, not a pretty sight, to be honest, at the best of times, but it's been a, a wee bit, a wee bit rough the last few days for sure.
Yeah. No, I mean, have you have you noticed any kind of white spots on the back of your, back of your throat or redness?
Oh right, right, right. Sorry, you mean like looking... no, I mean I don't, I don't really like to look, you know, to look at it, so I haven't, I haven't tried to do any of that.
I understand, it's not a pretty... it's not, it's not something we we always um uh recommend. But um moving on, in terms of your ears, any dullness or blocked ears, pain in your ears?
Uh, yeah, yeah, a wee bit, I mean, you know, I'm I'm 50 years old now and my hearing's, you know, it's not as good as it used to be, but you know, I I think, I think it's all right, it's all right.
Okay. Okay. Fine. Um, moving down to your chest, um, how's your breathing been?
So do you feel more breathless or tight in your chest?
Uh, no. No, it's...
So you're breathing...
No, no, no, no.
Sorry, what was that?
Your breathing is fine, is it? Is it your, it's not labored or...
No, it's it's it's it's not, it's not good.
Okay.
It's not good.
It's not good?
No. No, no.
Okay. Okay. So you're you're feeling more short of breath.
Yeah.
Okay, okay, okay. Um, any pain in your chest at all?
No, no, it's it's it's weird, it's it's just, you know, it's just a wee bit, it's just a wee bit of shortness of breath, but it's not, it's not, it's not pain, you know, as such.
Okay. Have you noticed yourself any any any temperatures or fevers? Um, feeling hot and cold, sweaty?
Yeah, yeah, that's that's that's that's definitely something I've noticed, like, you know, in in bed with the wife, I'm having to, you know, get out and get the blanket off and put it back on again. It's it's not, it's not pleasant. I'm keeping her up at night as well, which is a bloody nightmare, but I mean, you know how these things are.
Seems, seems very difficult at the moment. Um, have you measured your temperature at all? Have you... got a thermometer?
Uh, no, I mean, no, I mean, you know, I can, I just feel it on my forehead, but haven't, haven't, you know, used a thermometer or anything.
Okay. Um, and just moving on, just very quickly, um, any other symptoms? Any nausea? Any vomiting? Any tummy pain?
Uh, the, the first, the first day I had, you know, a wee bit of, uh, what, you know, like, you know, the, like a wee bit of diarrhea, you know, but but that's, that's, that's fine now. Um, and yeah, but apart from that, no.
Okay. And how's your appetite? Are you eating and drinking okay?
Uh, yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to, you know, I think what what is it you, you starve a cold and you feed the... I can't remember what it is, but I think, uh, my appetite's been, been all right, yeah, yeah. Trying to, trying to keep the fluids up as well, you know, here that's what you should do.
Yeah, absolutely, I can completely recommend that. So keep, keep doing what you're doing. Um, and just lastly, you know, any, any kind of muscle pain, joint pains?
Yeah, it's, it's it's just been a, I mean again, you know, I'm, I'm getting just a wee bit older now, so it's, it's not something that I was thinking about, but I have, I have noticed like when I, you know, when I'm bending down and, you know, moving about, it's just a wee bit stiffer than, than normal. You know, and I think that might be to do with whatever this thing is, but again, it's, you know...
Where do you feel the stiffness?
It's just kind of like, you know, when you're when you're bending like elbows and knees and just, just a wee bit kind of stiff, you know.
All over. Okay. And just remind me, when did your symptoms all start? You say a few days ago?
Yeah, I would say, what day is it today?
It's Wednesday.
It's uh, Wednesday, so it would have been, what is it, Saturday, because I was out.
Okay.
Yeah, I was out having dinner and then, yeah, I, I came, yeah, yeah, yeah, it would have been that because I was out for my wife's, she's, she was doing this wee thing with a wee bit of a celebration. So we were out for that and I remember saying to her, I was like, you know what? I'm, I'm, I'm not feeling great. You know, I stuck it out with her but I, it would have been that Saturday, so what's that, about five...
four, five days ago.
five days ago.
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Are you aware of anything that might have set your symptoms off? Is it something you've eaten or have you been traveling recently abroad or...
No, I haven't been, I haven't been... I mean, as I said, I was out with my wife. I don't know whether it's like, you know, the restaurant we went to was like, it was pretty good, so I wouldn't have expected them to be serving me anything dodgy or anything like that, but I I I don't know, you know.
Okay.
So, nothing I can see.
And without prying too much, what were you celebrating?
Well, my wife has just been promoted, so she's now going to be a, a head teacher of, of a primary school. So, just...
Yeah, a wee, a wee night on the tiles for that. So, uh...
Very nice.
...good.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, good. Excellent. So, just moving on, sir, regarding your, um, what we say, past medical history, are you, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? So, anything to do with your heart, lungs?
I'm a, I'm a wee bit on the chunky side, you know, uh, you know, I've, I've got a wee bit, a wee bit around the midriff, the spare tire's definitely there, uh, and I've, I've got the, uh, I've got the diabetes.
Diabetes, right. What type of diet? Is it type one or type two?
Uh, it's, it's, uh, type two.
Two.
Okay.
Type one, type two. I, I. 'Cause he said the last time I spoke to him, he was sort of saying like, you know, as a bigger guy, it's, it's kind of...
it's...
It's kind of like...
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
And, uh, I, when I was speaking to, it was this, it was another doctor I spoke to a while ago, but when he took the, when he was telling me this as well, he took my blood pressure and that, he said that was, that was high. Uh, high, higher than it should be.
You've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, or was that just a one...
Okay, all right. So, um, moving on, in terms of your medications, which medications do you take on a regular basis?
Uh, give me, I'm just gonna check, it's, it's, let me know if I'm pronouncing this correctly because I haven't got, I haven't got my glasses with me, so it's, Met, Metformin?
That's correct, okay.
And and there's another one, Lis, Lisinopril.
Lisinopril, yeah. That sounds right.
I think that's those two. I had I've got them written down on a wee bit of paper, so...
No problems, no problems, that's fine. Anything else, sir?
Uh, no, no, just, just, just those two. Yeah, I mean, a wee bit like, you know, a wee bit of aspirin or whatever every now and again, but you know, nothing, nothing long-term.
Okay, all right. And just moving on swiftly, sir. Do you have any allergies at all?
Uh, not that I'm, not that I'm aware of. You know, I mean, what, what, what are the allergies you get? Just...
Just allergies to medications really I'm, I'm asking, not as opposed to um, other things.
Right. No, nothing, nothing that, nothing that I'm aware of, doctors never said anything to me, so...
Okay. And just very briefly, socially, sir, just want to, very important to ask. You said you live with your wife. Anyone else at home with you?
Uh, no, no, kids, the kids have, have flown the nest.
Okay.
So, uh, I just, just me and the missus.
Okay.
You know.
Okay.
Good life.
Yep. And are you working at the moment? Yourself?
I am. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What do you do?
Uh, well, it's one of the, it's a wee factory just down the road. Um, so we just, you know, we just manufacture like, uh, uh, like kind of steel, steel parts, uh, things like that, you know. So, it's a good wee job. You know, keeps us, keeps the roof over the, over us.
Pays the bills.
Yeah, exactly, exactly.
What about smoking and alcohol, sir?
Do you do either?
I, I do, I do like a wee drink. Uh, I, the doc, the old doctor I had, he, he, he did say I was drinking just a wee, a wee bit too much. I mean, I'm not like, you know, I'm not, not an alky or anything, but just, just, uh, yeah, do like a few, a few pints every now and again.
Roughly on average, how many you drink a week?
Uh, pints.
Well, whatever you drink, is it a pint, beer, lager, wine, spirits?
Beer, you know, maybe, maybe a part like four, four pints on like a Saturday and then, you know, Sunday as well, maybe like nine, nine pints in a week, I would say.
Okay. Okay. And what about smoking, sir?
Uh, a wee, every now and again, but I'm, I am trying to cut that down. I've got a wee, uh, what are those wee things called? The wee vaporizers?
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, I've got, I've got, I got myself one of those, so I've been, I've been cutting down on the cigarettes, uh, and I just got this wee, this wee thing. It's great. It is, it is actually like amazing, by the way.
I wish you all the best on your journey to quit. I highly recommend it. Um, if you can, it will certainly help your health as well. Um, so just to really just to summarize, I think, you know, based on your story, um, I'm not, I'm not worried. I think, you know, what what you essentially have is a bit of a, a bit of a viral illness, perhaps, a bit of maybe early signs of a flu, um, which I think should settle down um, really on its own over time. Um, things to, you know, you can do to help yourself, you know, stay rested, drink plenty of fluids. Um, if you are, if you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular paracetamol will be beneficial. Um, you mentioned feeling a bit short of breath. I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but what we could think about is giving you a, a script for antibiotics, which you can maybe use in the next 24 to 48 hours if your symptoms don't get better.
All right. So, so, so if I, I just, I just lie down and take it easy.
Yeah.
If I'm still feeling a bit rubbish, then...
Yeah, I'll go and...
Yeah, I'll I'll give you a script today. Give it about 24 to 48 hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and run down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like amoxicillin, one tablet three times a day. Um, and then if you're still not better by next week, come back and see me and we can have another look.
All right. Okay. Okay, so I just, plenty of rest, lots of water.
Exactly.
Hopefully that will pass.
Yes, absolutely.
Right, that is, that's perfect. That's just what I wanted to hear.
Great. Well, I'm glad I could help.
And, uh, I wish you and your football team all the best.
I hope so, I hope so. It's not, not looking too good, but, uh, I...
Thank you.
Cheers.
All the best. Bye-bye.
