Hi.
Hi there, it's Dr. Smith from Babylon.
Hi Dr. Smith.
Hi. Can you confirm your name, date of birth, and your home address, please?
Yes, my name is Mary Jones. Date of birth is January 1st, 1980, and my address is uh, 60 Sloane Avenue, London.
Okay. A-are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today?
Absolutely.
What can I do for you?
So, a couple of things. I, I think I may have overdone my workouts and now my knees are hurting and they're clicking a lot. And it's starting to worry me. Um, I can't run very far um anymore without just feeling pain in my knees. And then, sometimes I also get this weird tingling in my toes. Um, so yeah, that's, that's it. I'm just concerned and I figured, you know, I'd call and see if you can help me figure out what's going on.
Okay, that's fine. So when do you think it started?
So probably it's been about two weeks.
Okay. Um and any joint problems before that?
You know, not, not really. I mean, I play a lot of sports, um, and I had a, like I play some ice hockey and I had this injury a few months ago. You know, I just like fell on the ice and and, you know, had a huge bruise, but I think that's about it.
Okay. So, um, at the moment, just tell me about the exercise that you're doing normally.
So, I'm training. Well, I'm currently training for a marathon um that's going to happen in June. And so I'm trying to run like, I mean, right now I'm actually not even doing such long runs, maybe like seven or eight miles. And so I started about, uh, maybe a month ago. Uh, I've done like, you know, four or five miles and I've just done like a couple of seven-mile runs. And then, uh, uh, and then, you know, I go to the gym like three times a week and kind of do my usual routine. Um, but, yeah, I think the only thing that's really different has have been the runs, the longer runs.
And have you had any times when the knee feels like it's giving way underneath you?
Um, well, I what do you mean by that? I'm not sure what what that means.
So it means if you're if you're there and you just feel it sort of jolt, like give way, feel unstable underneath you.
Not, not that. I mean, it just kind of starts hurting, you know? Um...
And does it hurt, uh, how far into the run does it generally hurt?
You know, I would say it probably starts like after uh, maybe 20 minutes or so, which is probably, I don't know, like somewhere around mile three maybe, two and a half or three miles.
Okay. Oh, you're fast.
Or maybe not. Maybe I'm switching my kilometers and miles, I'm not sure. I'm sorry.
And, um, do you have to stop running or can you run through the pain?
Yeah, that is a good question. So, um, you know, the last few times, the last time I actually stopped. I mean, I ran a little bit longer, but then I stopped because it was um, I I feel like it's getting worse.
Okay.
Um, and when I start doing my abs, that, you know, when I do my abs, it kind of requires me to move my, you know, um, to kind of go from the flexed position of my knees and straighten my legs. Then I hear all this clicking.
Okay.
And I think that also freaked me out and I just figured you know, something's wrong.
And you said before it's both knees?
So it's more, um, it's actually my right knee that hurts.
Um, any problems with your left one?
No.
Okay. Can you just describe in the knee or show me whereabouts the pain is happening mainly?
So, you know, I feel it, it's kind of weird. I feel it in the middle, but I almost feel like maybe it kind of, uh, um, moves to the right to the right of my knee a little bit.
Okay. Have you noticed any tenderness when you press over any areas in the knee?
So, yes. Well, it's, I have probably some fluid. I Googled it, and you know, it says that sometimes fluid accumulates.
Okay. Does it look swollen to you?
Sorry? Is the knee look swollen?
Um, well, it did, like, the first time I ran, it was a little bit swollen, but then I just put some like ice on it and it went away. Um, but right now, right now it's not swollen and right now it doesn't hurt, you know. Um, but it just kind of comes on when uh, um, or you know, right now when I flex and extend my leg, there's no clicking, but I'll notice it in the gym and then, you know, when I run it will start hurting.
Okay. And if you're sitting still for a while, do you have any problems when you stand up and you're locking up with the knee?
No.
Can't straighten it? Any problems going up and down stairs?
No.
Any problems just walking normally?
No. Not. I don't.
And in terms of range of movement, are you able to fully straighten the leg?
Yes.
And what about fully flex it?
Yes.
Okay. Are you taking any medication for the knee?
Well, um, since you're asking, um, yes, I I take Ibuprofen. Um, and I'll just kind of use it some time like uh um, like sometimes I have some joint issues, but you know, that kind of is not very frequent. So I'll take Ibuprofen for that. But you know, it's nothing like major, maybe like 400 milligrams max, something like that. I also sometimes will um, you know, smoke a joint. Um, and yeah, other than that, that's it.
Okay. And any other joint problems that you're getting? Any back pain, small swelling of your hands, feet, elbows, wrists, any pain?
Uh, well, I have sometimes, you know how sometimes like if you stand for a long time, your feet will kind of or your legs will swell up. Like I notice it because of my socks, I'll just kind of notice this indentation. And then another weird thing, I felt this just once, but there was this tingling in my toes, like uh, um, after the run, there was tingling in my toes like on my, you know, my right toes. Um, so...
On your right side?
Yes.
Any change in color or temperature of your lower legs?
No.
Any swelling which stays if you push in and then you release it that it stays there?
Well, I don't know if I really tried that, but I I will tell you that what I noticed is like if I, you know, when my socks come off, I kind of notice that indentation a little bit. I mean it's not like major, right? But I I mean, do you mean I just need to like press and see what happens if it like kind of stays or...
Yeah, and or any pain in the back of the calf or anything like that?
No, no, nothing like that, no.
Um and with your foot, has that gone back to normal now? Do you feel any altered sensation, tingling, numbness, anything like that?
No, it was just, it was that time. Uh, but it was just really weird because it kind of went on for a while.
Okay. And any pain in the joints of your foot or on the underside in the arch?
No.
Any problems walking around on hard floors?
No.
Okay. Have you had any other medical problems before?
Uh, well, I had uh... You know, just kind of your garden variety stuff, right? Colds and, uh, I mean, I I do have, I'm farsighted and so I had uh, I had Lasik surgery and then once I had this really bad UTI, they thought it was kidney stones and so they had me actually in the ER, and if my GP didn't call them and tell them that, you know, they don't need to give me morphine, um, that was kind of an awful experience, but uh, other than that, you know, I'm I'm I'm pretty good.
Okay. Do you take any other medications apart from the ones you told me about?
Well, I'll take uh, I take vitamin D. Uh, I take melatonin. Sometimes, you know, just for cramps, I'll take like uh, um, Ibuprofen or actually acetam- uh, I'll take what am I taking? Aleeve, whatever Aleeve is. I think that's maybe um, acetaminophen or I can't remember what class of drugs. You know, occasionally, if I'm really having hard times like I'll I'll sleeping, I'll take Xanax. Um, but I prefer melatonin. It's just sometimes melatonin doesn't work.
Okay. And any problems with your stomach or asthma, indigestion, acid reflux?
No, no problems.
Um, what I would suggest is definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using. So as much as you can, because that really does make a difference to injuries. Brings the healing blood into the area and it gives it the best chance of getting better. So as much as you can, use the ice. Um, obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon program, but um, I would try and ease up on the running if you can. And if it if it's painful enough that you're having to stop running, then it's not a good idea to do that. Um, it's fine to take the Ibuprofen. Um, I can prescribe you a slightly stronger anti-inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the Ibuprofen, but not with the Ibuprofen. But make sure that with food. Um, ultimately, we probably need to examine the knee. Um, so the best thing I would suggest getting an appointment with the physiotherapist first, who can do like a long assessment and examination of the knee. And then make an assessment as to whether we need to do any um imagery to have a look inside the knee and see if there's any problem with the cartilage.
Well, you know, I read I read some stuff online that that maybe like my ligaments, there's I think it's like ACL or or something like that, right? And so if that, I mean I'm kind of like freaked out that that may break. So do you think it's that or...
Um, it's it's not really possible to diagnose that over the phone over the video, so we definitely would need to see you. Um, the a physio is the best point of call because that'll probably be the most likely initial treatment, but certainly if the appointment time's too long to wait, then we can see, we can see you in as well.
Can you, so are you going to send referral for that?
Yeah, we can we can do a referral for that. If in the meantime you develop like persistent swelling, heat, redness, um, of the knee or high temperature, feel unwell, or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it, then you need to see a doctor urgently, so call us back in that case.
That sounds good. Thank you. Yeah, please. Sure, I mean, give me the stronger meds and I'll give that a try.
Okay. I'll send it through to your pharmacy for you.
Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Bye.
Bye. Bye.
