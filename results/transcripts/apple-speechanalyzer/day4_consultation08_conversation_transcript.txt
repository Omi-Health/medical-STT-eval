Hello?  Hi.  Hi there.  My name's Joe.  I'm one of the doctors at Bavlo.  I just can I confirm your name, please?  Yeah, my name's...  Sorry, what, sorry, your name was, name was Brian.  Brian, hi, Brian.  Nice time.  and your date of birth.  Yeah, my date of birth is the 8th of August, 1982.  Great.  And are you in a sort of confidential place where you can speak freely?  Yeah, no one else can hear me.  Great, and you're happy to continue with the consultation.  Yes.  Okay, so how can I help today?  Yeah, so basically it's just been happening over the last few weeks or so.  But I don't really feel like, um, like getting up in the morning is really difficult, and I don't have much energy at all during the day.  Um, often.  Yeah, just like doing most things that I would normally find easy, uh, is become quite difficult.  Okay, so things have become quite difficult for you.  Is there anything else?  Um,  Oh, no, it's quite hard to say, like, things like, not eating very much at the moment.  I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Um, so you've had difficulty waking up, no energy not eating.  and that's been going on for a few weeks.  When you say a few weeks, do you mean 2 or 3 or 5?  Roughly.  Well, now I kind of think about it, maybe even longer.  um, I guess, uh, might be related to it.  So I also started a new job slightly recently.  Um, it might have even coincided, coincided with uh, with that job a couple of months ago.  When did you start your new job 2 months ago, did you say?  Yeah.  Okay. and um so this has been going on perhaps for um sort of 6 weeks or so.  More like 22 months, I would say, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  So, um,  Is there anything that you're particularly sort of concerned about?  or hoping to get out of this consultation?  Well, um, I know that it's not really normal for me.  So, before this phase side happening, you know, I wouldn't have, uh, any problem, sort of, eating what I want to eat or, you know, doing standard things in life, and, and what I want to do is to, like, kind of return to that previous state.  uh somehow.  Um, I'm not sure how that is.  what the best way is of doing that art, but give some advice or whatever, that'd be really useful.  Okay, sure.  Okay, um,  Well, what I'd like to do is just ask you a few more sort of questions around what's been going on and also around your background health and things like that.  and then we can go on to sort of what can be done from there.  Is that right?  Okay, great.  So you say you've been feeling unwell with not a goal of energy, difficult waking up in the mornings.  Do you tend to, just on that note, do you tend to wake up early and then stay in bed in the morning?  Um, actually, I'm, just, uh, not, not only weight, you know, fairly, it's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all, probably.  I think that's probably close.  difficulties sleeping as well.  Yeah, and have you, and how has your mood been over this period?  Have you been feeling your usual distract?  I'd say.  I, I kind of, um,  Yeah, finding it really hard to quite difficult to keep focussing, I would say.  Um, not unhappy or happy, but just uh, quite just not focussed.  Okay.  So difficulty focussing quite distracted.  and would you say you've been in good spirits or is your mood low?  Um,  Actually, uh, now you, you mentioned it, like, my meat is a bit lower recently.  Um, and so I've nice like, uh, my sex drive has kind of decreased, um, a bit over the, the past few months as well.  So, yeah.  and uh, so, lower mood decreased sex drive recently as well.  and just on that note, just a few questions around that.  Are you able to, maybe slightly personal questions, but if you're okay to ask these, do you take, to have morning erections like you, is that something that you've noticed?  I haven't noticed anything like that specifically.  So you've no, so you're saying that you have not noticed morning actions, and usually you would, such a normal thing to have waking up in the with something, but you have not noticed those recently.  I have noticed those recently.  Okay, so and that's been a change, has it?  Um,  Important one, I don't think.  Sorry? Yeah.  I don't think it's important to change now.  So, you don't think there's been a change there.  No, there hasn't been a change there.  Okay, sorry, right, sorry.  Okay.  So, just going back to the mood symptoms as well, you've had difficulty focussing, easily distracted.  Your mood has been slightly lower with lower sex drive.  and in what way has your sex drive been lower?  Are you in a relationship at the moment?  Yeah, I'm married.  I've been for many years.  And, yeah, just, um, over the last few months, just, uh, in dissent.  Okay.  Sorry, you phrased that for a moment.  So less interested as well.  Okay.  And just to ask you a few questions before we wrap up is any significant past medical history.  um, so do you suffer much of any uh, mental health problems in the past or any uh, physical health problems?  Um, so in the past, um, I have a history of hyperthymet.  Hypo, hyperthymoidism.  Hyperthyroids.  Yeah.  I thyroid, just to sort of confirm it.  Sorry, can you say that again please?  Hyper, as in high, hyperthyroid.  Hypo, hypo.  Okay, hypo, Zyro.  you.  Thank you. Yeah.  And also in the past, I mean, I haven't had any kind of specific medical diagnoses along these lines.  Um, but the suspicion that it may have had an impact on me, but my father has committed suicide, um, about 15 years ago.  Okay.  Okay, and um,  Uh, do you take any medications?  I have a drug history of thyroxin.  So, maybe.  yes.  Do you continue to take thyroxin now?  Yes.  You do?  So you're taking thyroxin at the moment?  Um,  Yes.  Cool.  Any drug allergies?  Are you allergic to any medications?  No, I have no medication allergies.  No allergies.  And you mentioned the suicide of your father 15 years ago.  I'm very sorry to hear that.  Is there any other significant family history of medical conditions or psychiatric conditions?  No.  No depression or anything about that running in family or nothing.  Okay.  and your mother is as well?  Any brothers or sisters?  Yeah, she's fine.  and now I'm an nanny child.  Um,  Okay.  So, I just, sorry, my slightly random question, but any changing your vision?  No, no, nothing like that.  No changing with.  Okay.  And just to go back to your, you're saying you had low mood.  Some people who do have low mood and low sex drive can sometimes feel suicidal as well.  Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else?  No.  No, no, not really.  And are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities that you have done in the past?  Sometimes, I mean, I guess most of the activities, but when I've been doing sports as well,  I find sometimes it's quite difficult to breathe, um, so I have some kind of like shortness of breath, um, wending sports compared to maybe a couple of months ago.  Okay, so you've become more short of breath over the last few months.  and you've had,  Okay, so any other things around there, so more fatigue, more shortness of breath over the last few months.  with a lower mood decreased sex drive.  Is there, just before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like to talk about? Um, no, nothing specific.  So, um, going a little bit towards the end now, but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you.  I would like to probably see you in person and do an examination, and also we would probably like to do some blood tests as well.  So do you think it'd be possible to book an appointment in the next few days with your GP or that would be ideal, I think, here.  Um, and then we can, we could probably do some more, uh, do an examination and do some investigations really to see what's going on here a little bit more.  That makes sense.  Is that all right?  Yeah, that's very useful.  Thank you.  better to have some kind of plan.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think I definitely think we need a plan here.  It's been nice talking to you.  I'm sorry we run out of time now.  But we've at least started the ball rolling with some further investigations and tests.  I'm glad you're, you know, you're, although you have a low mood and you're, you're not feeling suicidal, just to confirm that and you're, and we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some of your tiredness and your other symptoms.  Let me see.  Thank you very much for taking the time.  Okay, thank you.  Thanks.
