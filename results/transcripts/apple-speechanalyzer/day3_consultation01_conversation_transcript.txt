Hi.  Hello? Hi.  I'm Maria.  Hello, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon.  How are you doing?  I'm all right, thank you.  I feel a little weird today, to be honest.  Yeah.  So just before we start,  Is it alright if you could confirm your full name for me please?  Yes.  Maria Trablo, sir.  Okay, date and your date of birth?  That is the 1st of October.  99.  Okay?  and your email address for me, please.  Yes.  M Trava at gmail.com.  Okay.  and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we have a confidential conversation.  Yeah.  Yes, I think I am, yeah.  Good.  Right.  You've mentioned in your patient notes that you're having some sort of lip swelling and after you had a sandwich.  Is that correct?  Yeah, that is, well, I don't think, I don't think it was, it wasn't as far much, but it was, it was something with prawn.  So, basically, I, I sometimes go with my friends to, to this place called Fat Park.  and we, we regularly have, like, a normal vegetarian soup or something, and yeah, and then I wanted to try something new.  So, what happened to us? I, I ordered a prawn soup.  It's it's it's called a lax, it's like a soup. I ordered a prawn one this time.  and yeah, and then my field start, like my lips start feeling a little weird, just in the corner, sort up on the left, 1st.  I don't know.  and then we went back.  We had a little bit of chat of banter.  I wasn't really paying attention.  Uh, now, I feel that, that there is a swelling.  Yeah, there is like a swelling on my on my upper lip and it's kind of getting bigger.  I don't know what to do.  Right. So, when did you have the prawn soup?  What time?  That was, that must have been just after work, so maybe like around 7.  Okay.  Around 7 o'clock.  and how long did it take to develop the swelling?  Oh, I wasn't really paying attention, so. It must have been like, must have been like, and a half an hour maybe?  Okay, in half an hour you developed the swelling, yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  and it's getting bigger and bigger.  Yeah.  still feel it like really pumping, but and it's kind of getting bigger.  it feels like it's getting worse.  Okay.  So just a few more questions.  So you mentioned about your swelling of your lips.  Is there any feeling of swelling in your throat, like your throat is closing up?  Any feeling like that?  Yeah, actually, I I feel like I can't breathe that well right now.  Okay?  And do you feel like, like your chest is tight?  I don't know if it's a chess, it just generally feels a little difficult.  Okay. Yeah, it might be.  I'm not sure  Okay.  Right.  and just a few.  Have you ever had these any kind of lip swelling in the past?  Not eating any food.  Yeah, well, maybe, I remember, like, a year ago, a year ago, I was out with my friends, and I think we went, like, to a late night kind of Chinese place, and I remember that, I was quite drunk, to be honest.  and I remember that after like having that very late.  I've woke up the next morning quite swollen up and had also like, felt really bad and quite difficult breathing.  But I didn't even know what it was  I had.  It was like a curi or something.  Okay.  And what did you take at that time?  Did you use anything like antihistamine or anything when you had that last time?  Well, I generally have asthma.  So, I tell, I take, oh, what's that called?  Salbutamol inhalers?  Yeah.  Yeah, so I do take that regularly, but I've always taken it.  I generally have asked.  And any other inhalers, is it just the salbutamol that you use?  Any other brown inhalers?  No, I don't think so.  No, okay.  Right.  And um, so do you use anti-stamines, like, set resine, loratidine, peritin, any of those kind of things.  No, I think sometimes, but I don't know which ones. So I have a peanut allergy as well.  I always had it.  I think I did get antihistamines for that.  but I'm not sure which ones.  And any point because you had peanutology, anytime you had to ever use like an injection.  When I was a kid, I think I remember my mom told me about it, but I don't know what it was because I was small and I changed doctors since.  Right.  Has your mom ever said that you had to go to hospital because you had an severe allergic reaction?  Yeah, I said, well, I was like 6 or something.  I, I, I think, offside, swelling is getting.  Oh, I thought, oh, yeah, I think I was.  okay now?  You're busy right now, to be honest.  You feel busy?  Okay.  Right.  Do you have any kind of antihistamines with you at the moment?  No, I don't think I have.  No, right.  Okay.  So, right.  All right.  I'm really a bit worried about you at the moment, Maria.  It, um, I think we need to call an ambulance because, um, from what history you've been telling me, it sounds like you could be going into what we say and an aphylactic reaction.  That's when your throat and your chest, you know, closes in, and you might need an injection like what your mom's, um, you know, what your mom told you as you were a young child.  Okay, right?  So is there any anyone with you at the moment or are you alone?  I'm alone at the moment.  So hang on the line while I'll call the ambulance, okay?  And I'll send them right to you.  Okay?  Somebody just came, yeah.  I'm not alone anymore.  Oh, okay, somebody just came.  So just call the ambulance, make sure that person's with you till the ambulance comes.  Yeah.  and because we are worried about an NF electric reaction, so you need to go straight away.  Could you ask the person whether they have any antihistamins around in the interim while we are waiting?  Yes, uh, mom, mom, do we have any antisements around?  Yes. Yes. Oh, yeah, yeah, we did that straight away.  And if mom can call, mom, if you can call the 99, 999, yeah?  and say that there is a suspected anaphylactic reaction and they need to come straight away.  Okay.  Yes, she said she will, yes.  Right. So straight away, take the anti-histance in the meantime.  All right.  Okay, okay.  Then I'll come up from the hospital.  Do you give us a ring back?  We might need to sort you out.  with your injections and things like that.  Okay.  Yes, yes, I'll do.  Yes.  Okay, then, take care.  Thank you very much.  Bye-bye.  Bye.
