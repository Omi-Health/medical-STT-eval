Hi there, good morning.  I'm Dr. Dingle.  Nice to see you.  Okay, so before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and just the birth, please?  Yeah, just one for me. and I am 32 years old.  Sorry, I didn't catch a date of birth.  I'm 32 years old.  32 years old.  Okay.  Could you tell me the 1st time of your address and your postcode, please?  It's 4 Park Avenue, and it's AB1, CB2.  That's great.  Thank you so much for that.  Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment?  Yeah. Okay.  So how can I help you today?  You've been having some problems with your afternoon.  that right?  Sorry. How can I help you today?  So I've been experiencing very weird symptoms over the past month or so?  and I just wasn't closing them.  I have Googled it and nothing coming up.  I'd come and speak to you about it.  Okay, so tell me a bit more about these weird symptoms you'll be having.  So it started with getting very tired.  for a couple of days and then I get back to normal.  and then I started losing feeling in my hand and on.  I get a little sensational, I get the needle.  Right.  So, just so, the connection is not so great.  You've been getting pins and needles in the hand, is that right?  Yeah, that was correct.  Okay, is that the right or left hand?  Am I right hand?  Is it always the right?  Yeah.  Okay.  We've lots of video now.  Maybe is there a bucket you can press? Okay.  Are you happy for us to carry on without the video?  I can't see you at the moment.  Yes, that's fine.  All right.  So, you've been having these pins and new episodes of numbness in the right hand.  Is it just the hand or does it go up the arm as well?  The pins and needles are in the hand, but I feel like my arm is getting weaker.  But it only lasts 3 days and then goes back to normal.  So it's very weird.  Right.  Okay.  Is there any involvement of your leg at all?  My colleague said, I'm walking slightly differently to normal.  And again, it's only for 3 days or 3 or 4 days.  Okay.  You said you've been having weird symptoms for about a month.  Yeah.  So what has been happening from the beginning of the month?  What else is going to happen?  I genuinely feel tired and weak.  and sometimes I feel nauseous and I don't feel like I want to do anything.  Right.  Okay.  Um, and um,  You know, your colleague said you've not been walking normally.  Yes.  Do you feel anything different on either side in terms of your legs?  Have you noticed anything different?  Yeah, so at the same time I get my arm symptoms, my leg feels weaker.  Right.  Okay.  and You know, you, the abnormal gate, has that been present outside of these episodes?  No, it has not.  So normally I'm fit and well, actually.  All right, okay.  Um, and these these episodes, how often have they been happening?  They have been getting more regular.  So at the start, it would be maybe once a week to every once a month, but now it's getting a couple of times a day.  Right, okay.  And how long have these episodes been going on for?  When did it all start?  Is it going to be a month and a half maybe 2 months?  Right, okay.  And along with these symptoms of the weakness and numbness, do you have any other symptoms at the same time?  Like swallowing or difficulty speaking or vision problems?  So, recently I've noticed I can't hold my cup of coffee.  and when I do drink coffee, it's slightly harder to drink.  and that's only been in the last couple of days, I guess.  Right.  Is that during these episodes or outside of these episodes?  Only during the episodes?  Okay.  Do you have any difficulties swallowing this all?  Not currently, no.  During the episodes, do you have any difficulties swallowing?  I feel like there's something in my throat.  What about difficulties speaking during these episodes?  Any issues with that at all?  No, I can speak fine.  Okay. Any visual problems during these episodes?  I don't think so, but I wear glasses.  Okay, all right.  Now, can I just ask?  has, is there any history of stroke or mini strokes in your family?  Yes, my father has had a operation to the side of his neck to reduce the risk of stroke.  Right, okay.  Um, and how about yourself?  Have you had any history of mini strokes or anything like that along those lines?  I know you're quite young.  No, so after my dad had his operation, I was required to be checked and my cholesterol was fine.  Good, excellent.  So you had a blood test done.  I did they check with diabetes as well?  They checked my diabetes, my blood pressure and my cholesterol, and the doctor said it was all okay.  Fantastic.  Okay.  Do you have any other illnesses at all?  No.  No, are you on any medication?  I take an aspirin, 75 milligrams once a day.  but that's because of something I read on the internet?  Okay, so so why is that?  Why do you take that?  I think it's meant to reduce your risk of stroke and height attack.  Okay.  Have you ever told a doctor before your GP that you're on aspirin?  Yes, I took, I started taking it after my father had his operation.  But that wasn't the doctor telling me.  Okay, and has any GP ever spoken to you about the risks of aspirin, whether you should be on it, or have you not told the GP in bus?  No, I haven't.  Okay.  All right.  Now, in terms of your kind of social situation, are you working at the moment?  Yes I am.  What do you work as?  I'm actually a doctor.  You a medical doctor?  Okay.  Which specialty are you in?  I work in a plastic surgery.  Plastic surgery.  Okay, great.  And do you have any allergies to any medication at all?  I'm allergic to penicillin only.  Okay.  And are you living alone?  No, I live with my wife.  Why, okay.  Um, fantastic.  Do you smoke at all?  No, I don't.  Right, okay.  Um, that's fine.  Now, obviously, you're a medic yourself.  Did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on?  I've absolutely got no idea.  Right, okay.  Um, well, the way you're describing these episodes, they make me concerned about mini strokes or TIAs, transit ischaemic attacks.  Um, and so that's something quite urgent.  and given that you've got a family history of stroke,  Even though you're quite young, I think it's something that we need to exclude.  So what I'm probably going to do.  In fact, what I am going to do is I'm going to refer you to a stroke, a TIA clinic.  Um, now just to double check, do you have the symptoms right now?  No, I'm perfectly fine at the moment.  Okay.  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to refer you to a mini stroke clinic or a TIA clinic.  I send that referred off now, and then you can attend them.  They'll usually call you in within the next one to 2 days, okay?  Because it's something relatively urgent.  Now, today it's Wednesday, so we've got a few days before the weekend.  So, basically, the deadline should be Thursday, Friday.  We're expecting to be seen by that time.  That's the kind of turnaround we're looking at.  And in that clinic, they'll be doing a number of things.  They'll be checking, they'll be doing the ultrasound of the corrupted artery that your father had, and they'll be doing, maybe, they might do a scan of the brain as well, to show that there's signs of a bleed there.  But they'll be doing a range of tests in a short time frame in order to exclude whether you have any illness.  you haven't got any kind of stroke or mini stroke.  Now, if your symptoms return, and they persist, they're prolonged, then you may need to attend A&E, okay?  Because a presumptive working diagnosis is mini stroke of TIA, okay?  and if a ministroke is prolonged, then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke, and in that case, that becomes even more of an emergency.  So we're not talking about waiting one or 2 days.  We want you to go to hospital in that instance as soon as possible.  Okay?  If things happen again, feel free to contact us.  We can assess you over the phone, we can give you direction and guidance over this.  That's not the problem.  You know, you've got easy access to us.  Okay, so this is the plan going forward.  I'm going to do that referral.  You should hear back from the hospital relatively soon.  The hospital, you could actually ring them on the pal's number, and then there's also the TIA clinic number.  I'm going to do that number in the notes for this conversation.  Okay?  So you'll have all the information you need to chase this appointment.  and if you want, you can ring them either today or tomorrow morning, today in the afternoon,  one or 2 hours, or tomorrow morning, just to find out one day at time to slot you in, and just to make sure they've got you in the system that they've gotten in books, and they're going to be calling you in, okay?  So this isn't an immediate emergency that you need to rush on to any, but it's something quite urgent that we need to deal with in a short space of time, okay?  So if there's any delay that transpires, for example, you can't make the appointment or, you know, that you don't get called.  something you need to get in contact back with us, okay?  Great. All right.  Did you have any questions at all?  No, I think that covers most of it.  Okay, great.  So just bear with me a few minutes, and then I'll send that all through, and then you should be able to have  you should have the information at your hands in order to take things further, okay?  Great, thank you.  All the best, taking them.  Bye bye.
