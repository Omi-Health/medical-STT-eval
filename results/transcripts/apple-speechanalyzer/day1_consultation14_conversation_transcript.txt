Hello?  Hello.  Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your date of birth?  Uh, yeah.  My name is April, and I'm 50.  You're 50, okay.  April, how can I help you this afternoon?  Well, I've just been having this, like, cough for quite a few days and my nose is running.  It's been super annoying and it's not going away.  Okay, when did it all start?  Uh, I think it started, like, maybe a bit less than a week ago, like maybe, maybe five or six days ago.  Okay.  And you mentioned a couple of things that you mentioned a cough, you mentioned a bit of a runny nose, all right?  Okay.  let's focus on your cough first.  Can you tell me a bit more about your cough?  It's just so continuous.  It's really, really frustrating.  It's quite dry and it's just all day, like, keeps me up at night as well, which is really annoying.  Okay, so it's a dry cough, so you don't bring up any, you don't bring up any...  I can hear that.  Yeah.  You don't bring up any mucky phlegm or anything like that.  No, okay.  So keep shop at night.  You mentioned the cold symptoms as well, the runny nose.  Do you have a sore throat at all?  I mean, apart from, I mean, the coughing is giving me a sore throat, but it's not like, you know, not more than that.  You know, just my throat is irritated from coughing, but it's not like, it's not that bad when I swallow or anything.  Do you have any, are you, how are your ears?  your ears feel blocked? No, they feel okay, actually.  Yeah. No pain or discharge like it is.  No, not paying, not paying on the ears.  Okay, all right.  Fine.  In terms of your breathing, how's your, how's your chest?  Is your breathing more laboured?  Um, I don't think so.  Like, I guess, like, it's laboured when I'm coughing and I can't breathe, but I, not, yeah, and I don't.  when you walk around, you don't feel breathless to you.  don't feel breathless.  No, I feel, you know, generally tired.  Okay, okay. Yeah, but not anything special with my chest.  Any pain interest?  No, not that either.  Okay.  You mentioned feeling tired.  Have you felt feverish at all?  They get a temperature.  I've been having like, like shivers?  Even when I'm in when I'm in bed.  You know, like when you when you go to sleep and and you feel like I should be warm, but I'm still, you know, shivering a little bit.  I haven't taken my temperature, so I'm not 100% sure if I had a fever, but it feels like I probably did, because I was just, I was next to my boyfriend, and he was completely warm and totally fine, and I just, like, couldn't stop shivering.  I kept adding more sweaters on and I was still cold.  I do, okay, okay.  right.  Fine.  in terms of any other symptoms.  Have you had any nausea?  Have you had any vomiting?  No, no, no, no, yeah, no vomiting, but, yeah, nothing like that.  How's your appetite?  Um, I mean, it's okay.  I, at the beginning, like when I was starting to have the system, the coughing and stuff, um, I had a little bit of diarrhoea.  Um, but, but I didn't, it didn't cut my appetite or anything.  I just like, my stomach wasn't feeling great.  Okay, had I got better now, the diarrhoea?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it got better.  It was only like the 1st, like it started at the same time as the cough started, and then it stopped, so I thought everything would be fine.  But then the cops just kept going.  Okay, fine.  Any problems with your waterworks at all?  With my work?  your waterworks, your urine.  Oh, no.  No, no, that's fine.  You're passing urine okay.  you drinking plenty of fluids and passing urine okay.  No, I drank loads of water when I started having the diarrhoea.  Now that it stopped, I just went back to normal.  Okay, all right.  In terms of any other thing, do you notice any funny skin rashes or problems with your muscled or joints?  Uh, like my, you know, when I had, when I was telling you, I had like the, I had chills, and I was really cool.  My mom was really hurting.  Pilates.  but like it's hurting me so much at the moment.  But to be honest, all I feel like doing is just lying in bed.  Right, okay, okay.  Sorry, that must be very difficult for you.  I know, right.  especially, like, in my arms, my legs, like, just everywhere, basically.  would be quite nostalgic and weak mentioned.  Yeah, pretty much. Okay, and April, are you normally otherwise fit and well?  Am I normally what?  Fitting well.  Do you have any other medical history?  Well, I have type 2 diabetes.  quite high blood pressure.  Okay, and would you take for your blood pressure?  what medications do you take on a regular basis, should I say?  Um, I take much formin for the diabetes?  Yep. I take with an upperl for the high blood pressure.  Okay, fine.  Any allergies at all to medication?  No, okay.  Regarding any family history.  there anything I should be aware of?  My dad also has type 2 diabetes, but I think that's it.  All right. Who's looking after your diabetes?  Is there anyone  Do you have a doctor in hospital?  I'll just stop you driving.  I just regularly go see a doctor and just checks up on it.  Same with the high blood pressure.  Like I have it under control and since I've started taking this medication,  I've just been like regularly checking that it's under control.  Right, excellent.  In terms of your social situation,  Who lives at home with you?  It's just me and my partner.  Liz, okay.  fine.  Is your partner well at the moment?  Yeah, he has none of this.  Like, he's just going ahead like, like nothing.  Like, I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him, but.  I'm not, uh, diary nothing.  fine.  Oh, wait, he's got away with it at the moment.  Okay. and are you working at the moment, April?  Uh, yeah, I am working.  But the 1st day, I skipped, because I was feeling just too shit.  but then I just felt like I had to go back because I had so much to do.  I've been going in, but it's not been fun.  No, I can imagine.  What is it that you do for work?  Uh, I am a developer.  Oh, so you work in the LAT field.  okay  Yeah, working IT, right?  Okay.  not too active a job.  No, have you been quite stressful recently?  Not more than usual.  I don't think it's related to stress.  Like, I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work.  I've been able to take a day off to try and recover.  So, yeah, I don't think...  Some reason I ask is sometimes stress can really affect your immune system.  But it's good to know you're not feeling stressed.  Do you smoke at all, April?  I used to, but I stopped for about 6 months now.  Okay.  and what about alcohol?  I mean, yeah, I don't think I drink that much.  I, I don't really know how you count the units, but I guess, like, I don't drink more than, like, like, say 3 evenings a week and I rarely get, like, properly drunk or anything.  What is it that you drink?  Wine, mostly. and how much do you drink on those nights?  I'd say like maybe 2 or 3 glasses.  Okay, so, um, yeah, so you're probably just about under limit.  of, um, the recommended limit. Something we need to think about just because of your blood pressure and diabetes, maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can.  Yeah. I think I should cut down on that.  Really, ideally, the right answer is to cut down completely, but in practice, I know that's not realistic.  So maybe for the 1st few weeks, one you cut down to 2 glasses a week and then one week thereafter, and if you are coping okay, then we can maybe try and cut down altogether.  Okay.  Okay, just something for you to think about.  Right.  So just as we wrap up, really.  April, I think based on your story, I think, essentially, I think you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness.  I don't think there's anything to worry about.  you know, you've had a bit of a cough, bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic.  I'm hoping that, you know, you're probably over the worst of it now.  It's been 5 days.  I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better the next couple of days, normally last about a week to 10 days.  What should I do if it just keeps going on and on?  Like, if it's still going on in, say, 4 days.  Yeah, absolutely.  So, you know, things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to, you know, get some nice, good rest, drink plenty of fluids, keep yourself well hydrated, you can take regular paracetamol.  If you feel like it's still not getting better in 2 to 3 days, it's probably worth coming back to see me again.  We can check you over.  And if you are still feeling feverish and your cough isn't getting any better, then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest, which can sometimes be a common source of infection.  Do you think I should keep going to work or do you think I should just?  Yeah, so I think, you know, really, I think it depends on you.  It's, um, if you are coughing, then there is a theatrical, you know, risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still.  So I would say maybe take a day or 2 off work, if you can, and get some good bed rest, um, and maybe think about work early next week.  Okay, okay.  But if your cough isn't getting me better or your breathing is getting worse,  I want you to come back and see me sooner, okay?  Okay, but otherwise I don't need to worry.  No, no, nothing nothing to worry about otherwise.  Okay.  All right.  very much.  Have a good day.  App appreciate it.  Thank you, bye.
