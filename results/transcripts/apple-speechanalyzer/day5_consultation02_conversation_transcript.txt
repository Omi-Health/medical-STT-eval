You can get some cranberry juice and take drink that as well.  That sometimes helps, and also some sachets, um, which you can get from the chemists and stuffers, which just help change the acidity of your urine.  So I can put the details of that on your notes.  Okay then.  If you feel like your pain is getting worse or not settling, you get lower back pain.  um, or you're getting a high temperature, or you have any problems actually passing urine, then it's very important that we speak to you again.  Okay.  The other thing is, if it becomes a common thing or a current problem, then we need to talk to you again about it.  So do I have to call after I finish my course of antibiotics?  No, not if you're better.  Okay. If you're, if you feel like your symptoms get worse at any point, or they're not resolving with the treatment, or you keep getting a similar, um, you keep getting a similar problem recurrently, then it's important for us to talk, talk to you in more detail about that.  Okay.  Have you got any other questions?  Uh, no.  What would be the pharmacy?  I will be picking up my medication from?  So have you already requested a pharmacy through Babylon?  Yes, I did.
