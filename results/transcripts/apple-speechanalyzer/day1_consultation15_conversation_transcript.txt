Hello?  Hello?  Hello, can you hear me?  Yes. Great, excellent.  Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age please?  Uh, yes, um, Laura Parkinson, and I'm 45.  45.  All right, Laura.  Well, how can I help you this afternoon?  Uh, yeah, so I have, uh, soreness in my fingers, and my finger, like the skin in my hands is kind of cracked.  Okay.  When did this all start?  Um,  A couple of months ago, like three, four months ago.  has it been that long, has it?  Yeah.  Okay, and so you mentioned your, is it the skin on your hands mainly, that's dry?  Yeah, I haven't noticed.  I mean, I have dryness, like, you know, in other parts, like my legs, but it's not, it's not very, it's not severe.  you know, I've always, you know, I don't hydrate very much, so.  it's very bad in my hands.  Can I ask, why have you come to see me today?  Is it because it's got worse recently, your symptoms?  Yeah, I mean, it's gotten to a point where it hurts a lot and I can't really do my job.  So I thought I should probably get it checked out. Yeah, that sounds like a very sensible plan.  Which part of your hands are affected mainly?  Uh, the palm.  Okay, all right.  Have you noticed any itchiness in your apartment?  Yeah, if you know it all the time, but yeah, it does get itchy.  Okay, any bleeding at all?  Um, I don't, I mean, no, I don't think so.  scratching yourself often and bleeding.  Um, yeah, I guess when I scratch it, yes, it has flat sometimes, but yeah, otherwise it hasn't blurred on its own.  Uh, okay, sorry, I'm just going to write some notes as we go along.  and you mentioned the skin is quite correct as well.  that right?  Yes, that's right.  Okay, all right.  I noticed a long time ago, but do you remember how it all started?  What were you doing at a time when it all started?  anything you may have done to bring your symptoms on?  Uh, I mean, I am, I do work as a housekeeper.  Um, and to be honest, I'm not always very good about wearing gloves, um, but that could be related.  Um, I switched jobs, uh, 4 months ago.  I've been working for as a housekeeper for, for a while though, but um, that's the only thing I can think of.  Yeah, I think that might be quite important, actually, I think that's definitely maybe a correlation between the two.  Um, fine.  and so you mentioned something about having general dryness.  you mentioned your legs as well?  Yeah.  Is that something you've had for a while now?  Yeah, it's not really, it's not really major.  a bit of grinding in my legs.  Right, okay.  Okay.  I'm just going to ask you some very brief yes or no questions.  I was, okay,  With your symptoms.  Have you have you had any other symptoms such as fever or temperatures?  Any nausea or any vomiting?  No. Any problem with your bowels?  No. Any problems with your urine waterworks?  Otherwise, you feel well, do you and yourself, you're eating and drinking, your appetite is well maintained?  Yeah, I feel good. Okay, all right.  fine.  In terms of your past medical history, do you have any other conditions at all?  I have the abuse?  Do you not pass type one or type two?  Diabetes, okay?  anything else?  Um, no. Any skin problems?  Eczema, dermatitis, for example.  No, but I know, no, I haven't been diagnosed.  No, okay.  Which medications do you take?  formant, okay?  Do you have any allergies, either to any medications or in general?  Okay.  Family history wise, is there anything I should be aware of?  Diabetes and what?  Diabetes as well?  Okay, again, any skin problems?  No, not that I know.  Any history of asthma or bell problems?  No, okay, all right.  Um, fine, in terms of social history, you mentioned how you work as a housekeeper.  and you're not always very good at wearing gloves.  You've recently changed jobs.  Which what, which kind of places you work and is it mainly residential or is it commercial?  It's a hotel.  Hotel?  Okay.  I do the whole thing, like the bedroom, bathroom.  Okay.  Do you think there might be a relationship between the 2 between the kind of the products you're using and your symptoms?  Yeah, I usually use books for bathrooms, but yeah, bedrooms and corridors are always.  Okay. Have you symptoms stopped you from doing any work?  Have you had to take time off work recently?  Uh, yeah, like the past 3 days, I haven't been able to go to work.  Okay, all right.  Can I ask a couple of questions?  Do you smoke at all?  Do you drink much away of alcohol?  Pints a week?  Once a week?  A couple of pints a week?  A couple pints a week.  Okay, so very minimal alcohol there.  Have you tried anything for your symptoms?  Have you tried anything over the counter, any cream?  Yeah, I've tried uh E45.  Any luck with that?  Yeah, no, we didn't really do anything.  No, okay, all right.  Um, I was trying and, and, and, and, and, but, it didn't. Okay, all right.  Mrs. Parkinson, so I think, um, it's in your story, I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis, which is very common in, particularly people in your, in your, in your field, who are using cleaning products, not using gloves,  You can sometimes get a bit of reaction between the chemicals and your skin.  The moving forwards, there's a couple of options.  So firstly, what we try and do is, you know, avoid the triggers.  So in your case, I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times.  In terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin, we can try some steroid creams to help with inflammation, as well as some stronger emolions, which you really need to kind of coat on throughout the day, three, four times a day for the next couple of weeks just to help with the moisturising of your skin.  If it still hasn't got better in about a week to 2 weeks' time,  I really need to come back and see me again.  and we can maybe think about other things we can give to you.  Is that all clear?  Yeah, that sounds good.  Great.  Do you have any questions for me?  Um, where do I get the military from?  Oh, so I'll do a prescription for you now and send it over to your pharmacy?  Okay, great.  Yeah. So you said a couple of weeks it should get better.  I think a minimum couple of weeks, 10 days to 14 days, and if it still hasn't got better, or indeed if it's getting worse, if it's spreading or dryness is getting worse, come back and see me sooner.  Okay.  Great.  Thank you, Laura.  Thank you.  Okay, thank you very much.  Thank you, babe.  Bye bye now.
