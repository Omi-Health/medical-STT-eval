Hello, can you hear me okay?  Oh, yes, I can.  you hear me?  Yeah, good, good.  So, my name is Joe.  I'm a doctor here at Babylon.  Can I just confirm your name, please?  Hey, my name is Vincent.  And your date of birth?  Uh, ninth of May, 2016.  Okay great.  And are you in a safe place?  Oh, sorry, a safe and confidential place to talk and just, you know, I'm happy to go ahead with a consultation.  Yes, yes I am.  Great.  So how can I help?  Yeah, so I have a call that, I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week and it's been caused me problems, I've had to stay away from work for about 3 or 4 of those days because of what managed.  Okay, I'm sorry to hear that.  So you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week.  And what came what came first?  Are the sore throws game 1st and then after D or 2 the cop?  Okay, okay.  And are you coughing up anything?  No, it's very dry.  Okay.  So I'm just going to ask a few questions about your current symptoms and then a little bit about your background and something else about what we can do a little bit later on in the consultation to help you.  But before we go on, anything you're particularly concerned about, or have any ideas, what might be going on? You said that you had a cold.  Well, well, I mean, you know how we all are.  Once this happens, you Google it, and it seems to be all kinds of bad things it could be, it could be, it could be a cold or a flu, obviously, but it caused me tuberculosis, cancer always comes up, so it'll be good if none of those.  Right.  So, yeah, I can provide a little bit of reassurance, and we can talk about those a little bit as well.  And was there anything you're particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation?  Well, yeah, so reassurance, or like, hopefully some sense that it's not anything too serious, but also, if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better or any advice, or maybe even a sick note, so that if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer, I can get one.  Sure.  Okay.  All right, so we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms, and I'm sure we can get a those things, uh, and some reassurance.  your concerns.  So, um, you mentioned that you started with a sore throat about a week ago, developed into a bit of a dry cough.  I'll just ask a few questions around those.  So do you have any shortness of breath?  Yes, yes, I've been having shorts.  Yeah, I've been having shots of breath, yeah.  You are short breath.  And do you have any wheeze or chest pain?  Are, yeah, a bit of broad back? You're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well?  Yes.  Okay.  And how, when did you start to develop a shortness of breath?  I think so. So the sorcerer, so today is Friday, sore throat was about, last week, Friday or Thursday.  coffers, Saturday, so the, so the, so the, so the, so the, so the, so the, so maybe a day or 2 later, so, three, four days ago.  2 or 4 days ago, you started developing.  And is the cough worse at nighttime?  No, it's the same throughout the day, same throughout the day.  And when you say you're short of breath, just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are.  So, are you able to, so, like, walk up a flight of stairs, for example, or are you short of breath of rest?  Oh, yeah, it's like when I'm doing walking, um, and I do exercise now and then.  So, it hasn't been super bad, like, hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual and a little bit worried.  and you're a bit concerned about that, okay?  So I just need to ask a few things about your background as well.  So, do you have any other medical conditions or medical history?  No, just, no, no, parts of medical history, no.  No possible goal.  No history of asthma.  Nope. and any history of clocks on your legs or your lungs. So these are DVPs or peas.  No one in your family's had those, clots on the legs or lungs.  Well, my mother had a lung cancer.  Your mother had lung cancer.  Do you smoke?  No. You ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos?  You know?  don't know if that'sbestos ever smoked. I mean, once or twice in Amsterdam, but not really.  Okay.  Um, and uh, this, so just going back to the, your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough.  It's a dry cough, no, you're not coffee company phlegm.  Do you have, and you say you don't have any chest pain as such?  Are you taking any medications?  currently in the moment?  No, I'm not. Okay, are you allergic to any medications?  Not to any medication, but I'm allergic to peanuts.  Peanuts, okay.  Um, and, uh, you mentioned that your mother had lung cancer.  Any other family history of any significant illnesses when running in your family?  No, no, that's the only one, just one cancer from my mother.  Yes, man.  Okay.  And you say you have a cold, so do you have cosinus congestion or? No, it seems to be all entirely with just my throat, like my nose is.  Just your throat and any recent travel or have you always lived in the UK?  Uh, no, so I, I haven't always lived in the UK, like, so I was born in the US and moved over about 12 years ago, but in terms of recent travel, just to Europe, nowhere to exotic.  Okay, so no, no recent travel, no significant recent travel anyway.  Okay.  And are you coughing up anything other than, um, so you're not coughing up blood or anything like that?  Um, good.  And are you feeling feverish, hot, cold, sweaty?  Yeah, sort of a little bit feverish at first.  So the first three or so days of this, but then the fever's gone away.  Okay.  And in general, do you, sorry?  Yeah, I was just going to say it also had a bit of a headache.  Like, headics that come and go rather, but, like, right now it's fine.  Okay. And in general, would you say you're feeling, you're beginning to feel better, worse, or sort of staying safe?  So it's like, it's up and down.  So, so, let's see.  So I started last week and I stayed home from work 2 days this week.  I think it was maybe Tuesday and then Thursday, so like I felt better and then worse again, and then worse again.  So it's been, yeah, a kind of constant, but constant in being variable, that makes sense.  Okay. And I just really need to ask any other sort of risk factors that you may have.  So, um, no sort of significant weight loss, um, or unexplained weight loss, any rockers.  So no weight loss, but I have been, have been losing my appetite recently, and I mean, I usually it's a lot sort of, and I enjoy eating as well, but like, that's been a bit concerning.  You've been losing your appetite recently.  Yes, and you're a little bit concerned about that.  But you haven't you haven't lost any weight that you think.  and any sort of rashes or anything, and you,  Okay.  Um. So, I would ask to examine you now, but I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat at least, to see if there's a probably...  Oh, no, well, no, it's okay.  I might think about doing that.  Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck?  that you can feel.  Uh...  Not the, no, okay.  Um, and so finally, you were talking about,  I mean, it sounds to me that you've been a little bit up and down, sore throat, developed a dry cough.  You are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath.  What I would say, we're just coming to the end of the consultation now is if you feel significantly worse.  if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness, or breathlessness that you are concerned about, and I would advise you to see the potential games here, GP, and actually see somebody physically.  But I think for now, I can sort of try and reassure you that if this clears up, as I expect it would, so I expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days, if it's not, please get in touch with the medical professional gain.  and I would expect it too, and so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis. Your concerns about lung cancer, was that the other thing you concerned about?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, so, again, if you're not getting better, please see somebody again.  I've just got four seconds now.  So nice talking to you, and we got to tidy up, yeah.  Okay, so...  and I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days off work, and paracetamol, lots of fluids, and rest up, and as I say, if you're not feeling better, please get in touch.  Okay, all right.  I'm good there.  Thank you.
