Hi there, it's Dr. Smith from Babylon.  Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth, and your home address, please?  Yeah, it is. and it's 14th of August 1989. and was it was the last bit?  Your address.  It's one Babylon Avenue.  And are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today?  What can I do for you?  And it coming, I don't really know what's been going on, but it's just aching all over. Definitely the last 6 weeks, it might have been slightly longer than that, but it's just sort of that feeling really tired, run down.  Okay.  Um, so when when do you think you were lost well?  Uh, where are we now?  just like April.  Definitely Christmas New Year.  I felt relatively well, I think.  So since then.  Actually, yeah, I, I was on holiday in, um, in the States, and, yeah, it's probably coincided with sometime around then, end of January startup fair.  So do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back?  Probably a couple of weeks after I got back.  Were you well when you were on holiday?  Yeah, had a great time, very active.  Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhoea vomiting, anything like that?  Um, no, not that I recall.  Um, yeah, not. No, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards.  Okay, so just tell me what symptoms you've been having.  In terms of just your general health, any persistent cold symptoms or eerates, sore throat, chess, cough, shortness of breath, phlegm, anything like that?  Uh, no.  Any changing your weight at all?  I don't think so.  I'm probably less hungry, but no, no weight change, just a bit.  Are you eating different amounts?  Uh, yeah, probably slightly smaller portions or, yeah, more of an effort to actually eat everything that's in front of me.  Any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat or abdominal pain?  No.  Any change in your wild habit, diarrhoea, vomiting or blood in the stall?  Uh, no.  Any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine?  No, that's all fine.  Okay.  And any other general symptoms like rashes?  I don't have any rushes now.  In fact, I've got a photo on my phone if that's helpful.  try and show you, hang on.  Because this, yeah, this was weird.  This sort of came up and then disappeared after a couple of weeks.  That went the light.  Oh, no, that.  Yeah, whereabouts was it?  I think sort of car, back of my car, because I didn't notice it.  My wife noticed it, actually.  When did you 1st notice it?  Um, probably uh, around the end of February, the middle to end of that, and then it, like, it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time, and I, it faded over a couple of weeks, I guess.  Did you have any fevers at that time?  Um, I,  to be honest, that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat I had, so possibly a little bit feverish, but I sort of put it down to that.  Do you know where you got that when it started?  Had you been walking?  Did you get any bites that you noticed?  I definitely, like, I do quite a lot of walking, and we did quite a lot while we were out in the, on holiday as well, but definitely, um,  Yeah, I mean, I don't recall any bites.  I remember seeing anything bitten, but you often, like, yeah, as you're walking through, I was in shorts and boots.  Whereabouts were you in the States?  Um, just sort of near Yosemite.  Okay.  And any headaches, blood, vision, tingling numbness?  Um, no, the sort of headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy.  And have you been able to go to work as usual?  Um, I've been going to work.  I don't know how effective it's been, but yeah, I've been.  I work for a health technology company, actually.  Okay, and has your concentration been affected or your tiredness levels in the daytime at work?  Yeah, definitely sort of tired and, um, yeah, less energy sort of, probably engaged than I, I would normally be.  Have you been able to exercise okay?  Um,  No, as much.  I don't know if it's, I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it.  I'm not exercising as much as I would normally.  Okay, fine. and how's your mental health, your stress levels?  I look pretty good at the moment, actually.  Like, previously that has been an issue, but, um, other than sort of physically feeling a bit, uh, crappy, I've, yeah, in a pretty good place.  Okay. Apart from that rush, any other rushes on your skin or swelling of your joints or pain in your joints?  Yeah, sort of aching shoulders back, hips, knees, but sort of, yeah, not anything.  swelling that you've noticed.  what happens, wrists, ankles, toes.  Uh, no.  Okay.  and any other significant medical problems in the past?  Uh, I mean. Pardon?  Asthma and hay fever, if they help.  Okay, any flour of super asthma recently?  No, pretty well.  You take any regular inhalers or other medication?  Yeah, I've got one of those preventers, I think. Yeah.  I've not used my. You haven't been used yet, sir?  I haven't, I've been using the every day for the morning and night, but not the... Okay.  And any, um, do you take any other medications?  Um, I, I think, um, one of the, I think it's, it might be, you're, can I get that from, just from the pharmacy?  Yeah, it's fine.  and do you smoke?  Drink any alcohol?  Sorry, occasionally, that one.  Okay.  and who do you live with at home?  Just my wife.  Um, Sorry.  So with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms, and just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for 6 weeks.  That's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels.  I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the new normal things, like liver, kidneys, blood count, et cetera, but also some more specific things, like bacterial infection you can sometimes get, including one that you can get, which can produce a rush like that.  So that would involve blood tests.  Are you happy to do that?  Yeah, I'm in general happy with, but.  What's the infection?  Well, you can get a, can get bacterian infection caused, which is called, um, It's called lime disease that you can get a rash of that from a tick foot.  So that's something we would do a test for as well.  Okay. And if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it. So it's definitely worth checking for, but we would also check just for other things, which can cause reduced energy tiredness and aching persistent over 6 weeks.  Okay. So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line,  and then when you've had the test arranger follow-up that week after after you've had the test done.  Okay, so do the test 1st and then, and that follow-up, we can just do over the phone again.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can do that over the phone to start with.  Excellent.  Okay.  That's really helpful.  Thank you very much.  Oh, sorry, he broke up with it then.  Any other questions?  Oh, no, not no.  Okay, that's great.  take care  Okay, okay.  Thank you.  Bye.  Sorry much.
