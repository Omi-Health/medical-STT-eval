Hello?  Hello.  Can you hear me?  Uh, yes, I think it's a bit better.  It's a bit, it's a bit,  not very clear, but let's continue anyway.  Okay, let's start again.  how can I help you, sir?  Yes, so it's been a few days now.  I have like a sore and a redskin.  It's kind of, it's really itchy and it's like super annoying.  So I'd like to find something quick to solve it.  No, no problems.  happy to help.  Whereabouts in your skin is it affected?  Mostly like my chest, my my hands, my arms, like I agree, it's super annoying.  Like, it's itching a lot, like, all the time, and I can't even sleep at night.  Like, I really need something quickly to solve it because even at work, I, like, when I'm in the meeting and I have to, like, think about my work and focus, like, actually focus on my work.  It's really annoying because I can't actually think about what I have to say.  I'm always like disturbed by this disease.  No, no, okay, I understand this is obviously affecting you, and we'll try very best to get us sorted out for you.  Have you had anything like this before in the past?  Um, so, yes, earlier, I was like prescribed for my eczema, and they gave me like some cream and something to, when I, like, was shower, uh, when I was in the shower, I had to put something, but, um, did they help?  Um, I mean, at that time, yes, but the symptoms, like these symptoms, like, when the symptoms appear again,  I tried those and it didn't work.  I've tried a few things, like, I bought, like, a steward cream at the pharmacy last night, but it apparently didn't help because it's still itching a lot today.  Yeah.  Do you remember the name of the cream you bought?  Uh, stir it cream?  Okay, steroid.  okay  would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different?  Um.  It's much more like itchy, and my eczema was more like only in the arms, and now it's also on the chest, and in the, on the hands as well.  Yeah, when, like, I like, for instance, hiking during the weekend.  and I am, I can't really do it anymore because it's like very, like, like I wanted to do that last weekend and it was super painful and I have to take like showers every day to be able to kind of ease this itching parts, which is very, very annoying.  No, well, okay, that's okay.  So you mentioned the itchiness.  You also mentioned it's been quite sore.  Have you noticed any bleeding or discharge from your skins?  No. So my skin is a bit cracked in some baths, like kind of cracked, if you see what I mean.  But, yeah.  any other pus or blood coming out of your skin?  No. And you mentioned it all started three days ago.  Four days ago.  Are you aware of any triggers?  So anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start?  So, for example, have you changed your shower gel, any clothing?  Have you been around anyone else?  No, it's actually, like, it's really annoying because I'm thinking about, maybe, I should change something because I haven't, and I don't understand, and I'm kind of, um, afraid of asking people around me because it's kind of, you know, I don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions, it's kind of intimate, and so I really enjoy your help now.  No, no, okay, that's okay.  Fine.  So just to re-summarize, for the last 4 days, you've had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, man, in your chest.  and did you also mention your arms and legs as well?  And no, just the chest, hands and like, like inside the airbows.  Okay.  Anything on your face at all?  In my what?  Oh, your face?  Oh, on my face?  No. No.  Okay.  And apart from this, any other symptoms have you noticed, for example, have you noticed any temperature or fevers?  No, no, just are itchy.  Itchy.  Nothing yet.  Okay.  So your bowels are working okay.  Your chest is okay, no cough, no breathing difficulties.  No.  You're passing urine okay?  I think so.  Okay.  All right.  It's always good to know.  So, I mean, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms?  Any what? Any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms?  So I had eczema before, so maybe it's this, but it seems like more, like my eczema was only on the arm, so I'm not sure.  I really have no idea.  Okay. No, that's okay.  So, um, normally at this stage, I like to examine you, um, to see the rash yourself, to see exactly what type of rash it is.  But from what you've told me, you mentioned it's, you've got some dry skin and some crack skin as well, and it's been very itchy.  and so with your, um, uh, your background of eczema,  Sorry, so there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you, which I completely forgot, my apologies.  Apart from the eczema, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of?  No, I just had asthma in the past, but not anymore.  Not anymore.  Okay.  And do you take any regular medications at the moment?  Uh, no.  No.  Okay.  Do you have any allergies to anything?  Sorry, yeah. Sorry, I was in Jimmy, I'll be thinking.  Hello?  Hello? Yes.  Can you hear me?  Sorry, I think it cried.  Do you have any allergies at all?  Oh, allergies, no.  No, okay.  And tell me about your situation at home.  Who do you live with?  So, I live with a few flatmates.  So you know I'm 31.  I, yeah, I have a full-time job and so I'm living with a few people to save money.  Okay, and what do you do for work?  Uh, I work at a pharmastical company, so it's been a, it's been a few years now.  It's kind of interesting.  We're working.  I'm like a kind of project manager.  I'm in, do you want to, to know more about it?  No, no, no, that's actually, that's absolutely fine.  Just a couple of questions I want to ask you, which can sometimes affect your symptoms, is, do you smoke at all?  No.  and do you drink much in a way of alcohol?  You know, once in a while, I can, I like hanging out with people once in a while.  So, yeah, I'd say a few, a few beers per week, something like this.  Nothing crazy.  I used to drink a lot more when I was younger, but it's been a while.  Okay, I'm going to say, at this stage, I've got to say, the sound quality is not great, but I will continue because we've come this far.  So based on everything you mentioned, sir.  I do wonder whether this is a flare up of your eczema.  The reason being that you said it's quite itchy.  It's manufacting your chest and your back.  and having looked at your skin, the rash does pick quite familiar.  You mentioned using steroid creams yesterday, from the pharmacy, I wonder whether they're giving you stronger prescription of a steroid may be beneficial, which I'm happy to prescribe to you today, as well as I'm going to give you some emoleents, which helps to moisturise the skin, which I want to use in the bath and shower.  And it's definitely worth using that for the first 7 to 10 days before we make a decision on whether it's working or not.  It's also worth using antihistamines, which you can sometimes buy over-counter things like loratidine or pyritin, which can help the itchiness of your skin.  And it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap, because if that's causing your symptoms, then we need to have a discussion about it next time I see you.  Okay, just, I have tried anti-estamines lately, but it didn't really help.  Oh, could you say it again?  Sorry?  I have tried the antihistamines.  Okay. Okay.  So it's something for you to think about.  You can get different type of ancestor means I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well.  something like Fexer Benedine, which I can give to you today.  It's definitely worth trying it.  not going to do you any harm.  But I certainly think using the steroids and the emoleans on a regular basis over the next week to 10 days should hopefully control your symptoms.  But do come back and see me next week if things don't get better.  That sounds good.  Okay?  Do you have any questions for me?  No, that's it.  Okay, well, I wish you the best.  Thank you very much.  Have a good day.  Bye.  Thank you, there.  Bye.
