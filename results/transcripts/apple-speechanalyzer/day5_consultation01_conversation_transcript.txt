Oh, hello.  Hello, I'm Dr. Garrity.  Oh, sorry.  Can I take your full name date of birth and your home address, please?  Uh, yeah, it's a gentleman.  and 5 King's Place.  And are you in your date of birth?  It's the 20th of 4, 1990.  Okay.  and are you in a private place you can have a confidential consultation today?  Yes, I am.  What can I do for you today?  I've got a really bad headache.  had it for about a day now.  Okay.  And can you just tell me about how it started?  What were you doing when it came on?  Um, yeah, just since yesterday morning since I woke up, really.  just, yeah, kind of throbbing, had I?  haven't really wanted to leave the house much since then.  Okay, and whereabouts in your head is the pain?  Mainly on the left side?  Okay, what does it feel like?  Um, it just kind of feels like it's throbbing.  It's quite intense, sort of comes and goes.  Um, yeah, quite sensitive to light.  Um, yeah, quite painful.  When when you say it comes and goes, does it completely go away?  Uh, just kind of fades, so it's still there a little bit, but it kind of gets more or less severe.  Okay.  And any other symptoms that you've had, any problems with your eyes or your eyesight?  No, not at all.  Any abnormal smells or taste?  No.  Any any nausea, vomiting.  Uh, no, no, good feeling fine, actually.  and have you been eating and drinking?  Okay.  Yeah, same.  Okay.  And normally, do you get any headaches?  No, not really.  it's not something I've ever had before  Okay.  and has it occurred at a particular time in your menstrual cycle?  Um, no, not particularly.  my period was about a week ago.  Right, okay.  and how were you the day before it came on?  Have you had any other symptoms like feeling feverish, emperor churning, runny nose, sore ears?  No, not made any thought, cold symptoms, I'd drink, okay, the day before.  Okay.  And at the moment, how are you feeling?  Um, it's still pretty bad.  Um, yeah, still kind of throbbing.  Yeah.  Have you had any changes in your skin?  No skin for the vine.  Have you checked your temperature at all?  you got a thermometer at home?  Um, I haven't, um, I don't feel like I'm favourite, but I haven't checked.  and any problems with weakness, tingling numbness in your arms or legs.  No, at all.  and what have you been doing since it came on?  Have you been able to go to work or have you been at home?  Um, taking some painkillers, mainly been at home.  um, yeah, just kind of, kind of seems to be worse when, I mean, a light room or like sunlight, so I've kind of just been staying in as much as possible.  Okay, does it get worse with any position that you're on?  Is it worse when you lie flat when you bend forward?  Um, no, I think I've generally been lying down. It would be better that way.  Any problems if you cough or sneeze?  No, but I haven't really got a cough or anything.  Okay.  Can you just tell me a bit about your medical history in the past?  Have you had any significant medical problems, any hospital admissions, operations, anything like that?  No, not recently, nothing.  Do you take any medication?  Uh, no, just contraception.  and which contraception do you think?  Uh, microgone, uh, when did you start that one?  About 6 years ago.  Do you get any side effects from it?  Not really.  Um, no, not too much.  Okay.  and anyone in your family had any medical problems?  My mum had high blood pressure and she's got a history of migraines.  Okay. That's probably affected me before.  And have you had your blood pressure checked for you recently?  I haven't actually, no.  Have you had it checked when you've had the repeat prescription done?  Yeah, yeah.  So probably about a 6 months ago.  Do you know if there's been any problems with it?  It's always been fine, I think.  Okay.  Um, and whereabouts, whereabouts do you live at the moment?  You can really want to adjust you.  Who do you live with at home?  Uh, just with health, mate.  I'm just running.  Okay, and do you drink much alcohol today?  Um, are they a normal amount?  Probably, you know, a few drinks at the weekend.  Okay, do you smoke?  Yeah.  Did you take any other drugs of any sort?  No.  Um,  So, see, what tablet students have you been talking already?  Sorry?  tablets have you been taking already for it?  Just per second mile.  I'm allergic to aspirin, so I haven't been taking that.  What happens when you take aspirin?  I just feel really thick.  Okay.  and have you ever taken any non-steroid on some plum trees like ibuprofen, naproxen, anything like that?  I have in the past, I haven't been taking it back yet.  Okay.  Um, so this headache is new to you and you've not had regular headaches before?  Yeah.  What I would suggest is taking some anti-inflammatories along with a paracetable.  Um, as you said you're eating, okay?  Yeah, yeah, fine.  I mean, from the sounds of it, it does sound quite like a migraine, but obviously even had no history of that in the past.  Um, and has anything changed recently or any anything you've done recently might have triggered it.  Uh, not like I think of.  Um, they've been a bit stressed out of work, that kind of thing.  Yeah. Well, that would be the 1st thing to do is to take some out-inflammatories along with a paracetamol, make sure you're really well hydrated, and see how that goes.  And if it isn't settling, or it's getting worse, or you get any other change in your headache, um, or you're unwell with it, with a high temperature, then we would certainly need to speak to you straight away about that.  The other thing is, if you, if you're getting persistent, headaches, or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle, or certain things seem to trigger these headaches, then it would be worth having a further discussion about it, to see whether we can work out if we can help that longer term.  Okay, brilliant.  Thank you.  I would try and manage to get your blood pressure checked, if you haven't had a chat for a while.  and thing to do is to have a thermometer at home, so you make sure that your temperature's okay.  Yep. If you have a raised temperature or headache's just getting worse and redevelop any rashes or anything like that, then we'd need to speak to you straight away.  Yep, okay, that's brilliant.  Okay, so I'll take the microphone and I'll hopefully be a bit better in a day or 2 then.  yeah.  Okay, so have you got any other questions?  No, that was it today.  Okay.  Okay, then we'll, we'll, we'll speak to you again.  Okay, brilliant.  Thanks so much, so much.  Bye.  Bye.
