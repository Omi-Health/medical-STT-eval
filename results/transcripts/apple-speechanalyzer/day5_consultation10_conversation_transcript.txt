Hi there, it's Dr. Smith from Babylon.  Can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address, please?  I can't hear you at the moment, actually.  Could you turn it up, the volume up?  Yeah, that's better.  Thank you.  Okay, sorry about that.  Are you in a private place you can have a consultation?  What can I do for you today?  Um, I've been having this blinding headache for a few days, um, and it's like really bothering me and I find it very hard to focus or like I can't even go to work.  Okay, and any headaches in the past before this?  Not really just the on and off.  Um, I recently had a one for like 2 days, um, but it just went away with Apple problems, so nothing like, or longer than 2 days.  So how did this start?  Um, it just started, all of a sudden I woke up one morning with a headache and that was 3 days ago and I just keep having it.  Doesn't really go away with Appleblock, either?  I try that, but it just, it gets a little bit better, but it doesn't go away.  Okay, and whereabouts in your head is the pain?  Um, it's kind of all over, but I feel like over my right eye is a bit stronger.  Okay, any problems with your vision or any problems tolerating their light?  Um, light is definitely mainly more sensitive, like, um, I don't really like strong light.  Um, and, um, yeah, vision, I think, I get this, shooting lights sometimes.  um, not sure how to explain it, just a bit of a weird kind of vision.  Okay, and any nausea or vomiting?  No, I'm feeling a bit sick, but no, what I think.  Any tingling or numbness or weakness anywhere?  Um, no. Any change in your smell or taste?  No, no, at all.  and in the past, when you've had headaches, what have they been like?  Um, I would say fine normal headaches, just um, a bit of a pressure in between my eyes.  um, but nothing major.  Okay.  and with with this, has it been there all the time or is it coming and going?  Kind of all the time.  So I want to take up a drop and it gets a bit feathers, so it's a bit, like less, um, it bothers me less, but then I still have it, it's still there.  Um, and what would you say the severity is? If, if 10 is the worst pain you've ever had in zero is nothing, what would you say the pain is like?  I guess it's mostly 8 and then it kind of comes down to maybe a 5.  Okay, and what about at nighttime?  you able to fall asleep?  Um, yeah.  I'm sitting well.  Is it waking you up in the nighttime?  No, no, no.  I can wake up with it in the morning.  Okay.  Any worse when you change position or bend over or cough or anything like that?  Sometimes when I stand up.  quickly, I get a bit of a stabbing pain, um, or if I turn in my head, like, I kind of feel like something is moving inside.  Okay.  and have you had any eye checks recently?  Um, yeah, I've actually had one recently and nothing changed my vision.  Okay, and have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears, or pain over the sinuses?  Anything or flag?  Any nosebleeds or coffee up any blood or anything?  No. And just recently, have you been well or have you had any general problems, any change in your weight or tiredness, lack of energy, anything like that?  Um, not change of weight, maybe, um, lack of an energy bite, maybe, because I'm just having headaches, so I find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities, but, you know, when you have this constant.  at work recently.  Um, I work from home, but couldn't really manage to do it all the time, so sometimes I just do the day off.  So you've been, you've had it over 3 days.  how many days have you missed off work?  Um, so I work from home all these 3 days and, um, Thursday I work from home and then, um, the 2nd day I just do the whole day off and today I just tried to work on the 1st of the day, but I, I just stopped in the morning because I couldn't focus.  Okay.  and any other medical problems in the past?  Um, I think I only had the pomenal pain, um, when I was younger, but no cause was found and that went away, but that's the only thing I know.  Okay, have you been abroad recently at all?  No.  Do you take any medications?  Um, just the belt.  Which one?  Um, my salon.  and when did you start that?  Um, about a year ago.  Any side effects with that?  Uh, no, I don't think so.  Have you noticed any any increased frequency of headaches since you started that?  Um,  No, I, because they said they just, sorry, recently, for nothing, um,  but nothing really changes.  Okay.  and when you had, when you've had, when you described your headaches in the past, you said they were just general, did you have any visual symptoms, flow, right?  No, nausea vomiting with them.  No, nothing, none of them. Do your blood pressure checked recently with your pill?  Um, yeah, I had a chose in the pharmacy when I got the pill and they say it was normal.  When was that?  A year ago.  Okay.  and any allergies to anything?  And who do you live with at home?  Sorry, who do you live with at home?  Just by myself.  Okay.  And do you smoke?  Uh, no.  Do you drink any alcohol regularly?  How much in a normal week, do you think?  Um, probably, like, 3 beer, just once a week.  Okay.  and you take any other drugs at all?  Um. No, apart from the apple bruffin, I think, sometimes when the headache gets really bad.  Um, so, I mean, it's obviously the 1st time you've had such a bad headache, and you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well.  Yeah. But you haven't had a high temperature?  Have you checked your temperature?  Uh, no idea, but I don't really feel.  They broach or anything.  Okay.  Um, I mean, it, it, it could possibly be a migraine type headache, but in fact, it's all ongoing for 3 days.  We probably should book you into an appointment to get an examination. Obviously, if it settles, in the meantime, then we can cancel that, but we should do a neurological examination, look at the back of your eyes as well.  Okay.  Um,  In terms of medication, I can prescribe you something similar to ibuprofen, but a bit stronger, which you can take instead of ibuprofen, and you can take paracetamol at the same time.  Okay.  So if you're happy to book an appointment with us, with the support line for us to do a full examination, and start the medication, which I've prescribed to your ticket with food, if you're, you said that when you go to bed, your headache's okay, and not waking you up in the nighttime.  Yeah, it's not. But you mentioned my green, and that reminded me that my mum suffers from, actually has my grades.  Any other family history of medical problems?  Um, no, I didn't answer it, but I know that my mom, like, she has quite bad migraine, she, like, has the vomiting and everything.  Okay, that's fine.  I mean, if in the meantime, before your appointment, your headache is getting unbearable, getting worse or changing, then if it's that bad, then you should go to A&E and have an examination.  Otherwise, you can call us for further advice on that.  Mm-hmm.  When you have an examination with us, we'll check your blood pressure as well.  just to make sure your pill is still appropriate for you, because sometimes if we do think it's a migraine, then you would have to change your pill.  if you've had these flashing lights and things like that.  Is there anything in the field that can cause it or is it?  Well, some, so that pill, if you were having my regular migrates with flashing lights or other symptoms, it wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill, particularly.  We'd have to change it something else.  All right.  But you can carry on with that for the moment.  Okay.  Have you got any other questions?  Um, so whether you like, um, send me a referral to a specialist or... Yeah, if you book an appointment with the support team, then we can do a full examination then.  Okay  All right then, take care.  Thank you very much.  Bye.
