And any blood in the stool or in the urine that you've noticed?  No blood.  Okay.  Any episodes like this before?  How's your vows normally?  Sorry, I think I should close your bowels normally.  My bars are normally fine.  I would normally go to the toilet every day, so in the morning, just once. Episodes of diarrhoea constipation normally.  No. And is there anything you think might have triggered this off?  Have you been abroad anywhere?  No, but then, um, my, um, my brother, um, has actually been having similar symptoms, um, for the past, um, few days as well, and it does say, like, everyone in school, Scottish.  So, I don't know that might, that might be from him.  So you've been in contact with him, have you?  Yes.  Okay.  and any other medical problems.  Have you had any other symptoms at the moment like rash? No, no rash.  No, nothing.  Okay.  Any surgery before or abdominal problems or any other medical issues?  Well, apart from the fact that this one is given me abdominal pains, nor prove your subdominal pains before.  Obviously, I get the odd, you know, menstrual crumbs and all that, but, you know, that's, you know, that comes, I'm going.  Okay, and whereabouts is the pain that you're getting?  Um, it's kind of like, towards my level area, like, I can't touch my level area, it's just so slow, and it gets, yeah, so it's like the centre of my level.  and does the pain come and go?  Yes, it does come when it comes, I feel the strong obstacle to the to the loo and then sort of releases me and sort of like comes again.  It comes.  Okay.  Um, and do you take any medication regularly?  Well, I, I take my, my vitamins, that kind of vitamin D.  Every day, that's about, that's about all that I have.  And have you got a normal diet?  Yeah, I eat well, normally.  Do you smoke or drink alcohol?  Well, I don't smoke for, you know, I have a pint from time to time.  And do you take any other drugs?  No, like I said, I only take um vitamin. um, for my metro comes when it comes, maybe I might take a, a, a knife, just to eat the pain.  When was your last period?  Um 2 weeks ago.  Okay, you on any contraception?  No.  Are you having regular sexual intercourse?  No.  Okay.  and what's your job?  Um, I'm, uh. Um, uh.  Uh, graphics designer.  Have you had to miss work because of this problem?  Well, yes, I've had to actually work from home today.  I'm working from home today because I can't, I can't be out for work.  Okay. And who do you live with at home?  I live with my brother and my mum.  Okay.  And um, have you tried anything yourself for this problem?  Well, I've tried a home remedy.  Um, I've tried the, the, or ORS, you know, thing, um, above from my, my local, um, can you just repeat that?  The ORS, the salt, sugar, forest, um, mix.  The salt, sugar mix.  Okay, and how often have you been taking that?  I've taken that.  I've taken that like 3 times a day for the past 2 days. Okay.  Um, and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off or getting worse or?  I'm not getting any better because like I said, I've been I've been vomiting literally everything I take.  So I doubt that even that has had the chance to work.  Okay.  Um, I mean, it sounds like, because your brothers had a similar thing.  It sounds like it might be some an infectious gastroenterritis that you've got, which is usually caused by a virus, but it can be from something you've eaten as well.  If the symptoms, they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts.  Um, if the symptoms are continuing to get worse,  The key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough.  Um, sometimes you do require certain medication to help this if it's sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria.  What I would say is probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not sun to ease off, I think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment.  Okay.  Um, and we should also check that we're not getting dehydrated because if you're, if you're not keeping fluid down, then you can get dehydrated.  Um, how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even like drink water?  and throwing off everything?  Yeah, so you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts.  It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago.  So you obviously still um hydrated enough to pass urine.  But we, um, we should see you so that we can check your hydration and um, get that sample sent off as soon as possible.  Because if if you come into the clinic, you can send that sample off straight away.  Otherwise we would have to post it out to you, which would take time.  Oh, okay, so when can I come to the clinic to have this done?  Um, so we can we can make you an urgent appointment.  and then you can, you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration.  Um, but if, in the meantime, obviously, feeling more unwell, then we would get you seen urgently in A and E.  Okay.  So you could call us back in the meantime.  Okay.  So while, just, yeah, if you could, please book me the appointment, and um, yeah, I'll see how I feel, um, before the end of the day,  Hopefully, I don't need to go to ANE, and I'm gonna keep drinking, keep going with the rehydration salts, just tiny sips constantly.  so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and you vomit, so just tiny pony sips, but just keep going with it.  um and just have very simple food if you're going to have anything like toast or biscuit or something really light like that.  avoid fruit, vegetables, milk, anything like that, which might just make it worse.  Okay.  So you're happy to book an appointment through the support line.  Yes, please.  Right, okay, we'll do that for you.  Right. Okay, take care.  Thank you.  Thanks, bye.
