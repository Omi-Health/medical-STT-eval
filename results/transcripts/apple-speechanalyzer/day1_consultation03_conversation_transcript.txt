Hello?  Hello. Hello there.  It's Dr. Seed here.  How can I help you this afternoon?  Oh, I've just got this terrible headache since midday.  I'm on the left side  just making me feel so ill.  just feel like I need to vomit.  Sorry to hear this.  Can you tell me a bit more about the headache?  Well, you know, I noticed some zigzag lines in my vision a few minutes before the headache started.  My little flurred.  You know, it's just, I, yeah.  pain's just horrible, just making me feel so unwell.  Okay.  and I just want you to do something.  Well, let's try best.  Let's try and get you  try and get you well soon.  You mentioned this on your left-hand side.  Is that right?  And it started at midday a few hours ago.  Yeah.  Did a pain come quite suddenly or was it more of a gradual?  build up.  I don't know really.  happened.  Okay. and are you able to describe what kind of headache it was, for example, was it throbbing or was it more of a sharp pain?  Yeah, I guess it's. Yeah, I guess it's throbbing on that left side.  And is it moving anywhere else at all?  No, but it's worse when I move.  Okay.  Is that when you move your neck?  Well, like if I lean forward or like move my head or neck.  Yeah, the headache gets worse.  Okay.  I'm just really worried that I've just been Googling and like, I've read, you know, if you're, you get headache, gets worse when you move, it could be a sign of brain cancer.  Okay, is that what you're worried about?  Is that is that what your main worry is today?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  and I've like, you know, my, my friend's mum, she, she recently died of a brain tumour, so it's really concerning me, actually.  Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that.  I can understand why it's affecting you.  But why don't we, why don't we take a good history 1st and let me examine you and then we can have a little chat afterwards and see what's going on here.  So you mentioned a few things.  You mentioned headaches, and you also mentioned some zigzag lines before the headaches came on.  and your vision has been blurry as well.  Is that right?  Is that on both eyes or just left left eye?  It feels like it's on day.  Both eyes, okay.  Have you any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all?  Yeah, well, I'm wearing, I'm wearing sunglasses right now, because just, you know, lights really curting my eyes.  Oh, I see, okay.  and you mentioned that you've felt quite nauseous.  Have you vomited at all?  Yeah.  I vomited twice.  Twice, okay.  and this earlier today.  Okay.  Any temperatures or fevers?  Um, no, I don't feel feverish.  Okay.  Any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed?  No, I haven't noticed anything like that.  Okay, um,  and do you normally get headaches?  Not really prone to them, no.  No, but I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago.  Okay. And what happened then?  Just similar.  How long did it last for?  couple of days.  Did you do anything that made it better?  Um, yeah, I had to take painkillers.  and had to sort of go to bed and rest and have a couple days off work and work in the fashion industry and, you know, they're wondering what's going on, like having to take sick days. I need to get back to work today.  But, you know, what if it is a brain tumour?  What's going to happen with my future, my career?  You know, it's really about this, never had headaches like this before.  Like, why should we get now?  Yeah, sure.  I can see your concerns.  a lot of worry there.  But, you know, let's take a step by step and see exactly what the cause of his headaches are first.  I'm just going to ask you some very yes, no questions.  That's okay, ma'am. have you noticed any problems with your speech at all? any typical you do words?  Any problems with your arms and legs, for example, numbness or weakness?  No. and any difficulty balance your balance or coordination.  Okay.  And have you had any injuries to your head?  Have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head?  Okay, all right.  and you're feeling otherwise okay.  So, for example, your breathing's okay, you're not feeling breathless or No, okay.  Do you have any other medical history I should be aware of?  No.  No. So, for example, have you had, if anyone told you've had migraines in the past?  No. No.  Okay.  My mum, my mum had has migraines, but I've not been diagnosed.  Right.  my next question was about family history.  Is there anything in the family?  So apart from migraines, is there anything else, anything related to brain, for example?  What was that, sorry?  A mum has an underactive thyroid as well?  underact thyroid as well.  Okay.  Okay, any other problems, for example, the brain or you mentioned brain cancer, any other family history or that?  No.  Okay.  In terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis?  Um, my take, the pill, microgine on?  Okay, and how long have you been on that for?  About 3 months.  3 months, okay?  and is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else?  It's for contraception.  Okay.  That's something we made to have a little discussion about today as well.  Well, my next question was about your social, really, your situation at home.  You mentioned you work in a fashion industry.  Is your job quite stressful at the moment?  Yeah, it's really stressful, actually.  having problems with, like, people at work.  you know, manager's like putting a lot of pressure on me, just deliver and ah, yeah, it's not a good time.  Is it getting you down?  I don't feel down, just feel a bit stressed.  Okay.  All right.  And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally?  Nothing, really.  Okay.  Do you do much in a way of exercise?  No.  Okay.  Who's at home with you?  Um, I live on my own.  Okay.  Um, are you coping okay at the moment?  Fine. Yeah.  Okay.  Do you smoke at all?  No. and do you drink much in the way of alcohol?  Okay.  All right.  So normally at least I'd like to kind of proceed to examination.  That's based on your story.  I wonder whether you may have a migraine, a migraine type headache.  It sounds very classical of that of that nature, the headache on one side, the throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, sensivity, bright lights.  I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious, such as meningitis or indeed brain cancer.  I know that was a big worry of yours initially.  Thank you. thanks so much.  so worried.  that had cancer and, oh, now you say migraine.  Yeah, I guess my mum had similar symptoms to me and yeah, doesn't make sense.  Well, I hope I push your, you know, ear minor ease.  Certainly, this is the 2nd mybon you've had in the space of a month.  So I think moving forwards, there's a couple of options.  I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important to see exactly what's truding his headaches.  But we should also try and treat your headaches today, some strong painkillers will be advisable.  So, you know, I think about Paracetamol or even Cocodamol, um, and some anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen and naproxen, how does that sound to you?  Okay, that sounds good.  And, you know, if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we can maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the 1st place, something, you know, prophylactic medicines, then we can have discussion next time.  I see you next week, perhaps.  Okay.  Now, a couple of things I want you to think about is, you know, if your symptoms aren't getting better in the next two, three days, or indeed are getting worse, I'd like you to come back and see me straight away if possible.  So if your headache's getting worse and not responding to medications, or your neck pain is getting worse, or you're developing any weakness in your arms and legs, or your vision, then I'm willing to come back and see me straight away.  okay?  Okay. Does that sound all okay?  Doctor, that's great.  Great.  Any questions for me?  No, thank you.  Okay, have a good day.  Okay, thanks, bye.
