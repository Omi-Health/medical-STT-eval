Hi.  Hi.  Hi, how are you?  Uh, yeah, I'm all right.  Um, although I'm actually feeling a little bit uh wheezy.  Okay, my name's Dr. Go.  I'm wondering if this is that work from Abadon.  Can I confirm your name and date of birth, please?  Uh, yeah.  My name is Tina Smith.  and 40 years old.  Okay, and are you in a space that's quiet and private?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just in my room.  And you mentioned that you're wheezy.  Can you tell me a little bit more about that?  Yeah, so it started like about two days ago.  Um, I don't know if it's because, you know, I was, like, cleaning the house and, like, um, all this dust came out of the carpet and, you know, I've always the thought that maybe you've got an allergy to, like, dust, um, or something.  So, don't know if it was triggered by, um, you know, 2 days later, still not gotten any better.  So, um just getting a little bit worried about it now.  Okay, so you were cleaning the house 2 days ago.  and that's when it 1st started.  Yeah, that's right.  Did the wheezing start suddenly or was it gradual?  Uh, so it started after maybe an hour or so.  And has it got worse over the past 2 days?  Yeah, so it gets a bit worse at night, I find.  Okay.  And have you taken anything for the wheeze?  Uh, no, no, I haven't actually.  Okay, so, and the wee has been getting worse, and today you're particularly worried.  Is it because you're finding it hard to breathe or finding it harder to talk?  Yeah, yeah, bit of both, actually.  So I'm feeling like a little bit short of bread.  Okay. and actually when I'm, you know, talking to my friends and stuff, finding that sometimes I'm unable to complete my sentences.  It can get really bad, yeah.  And when you can breathe and you take a deep breath, do you notice any pain? Um,  No, no, no pain.  And have you noticed yourself feeling dizzy or the room spinning more than normal?  No, no dizziness.  None of that.  And have you been eating and drinking okay, particularly water?  Yeah, yeah, I think I'm having like, you know, 4 or 5 glasses a day, yeah.  Okay, and are you normally fitted well, or do you have any other medical problems?  Um,  Well, actually, I used to have like a bit of asthma as a child. and also in the summer, I sometimes get hay fever.  And when you get hay fever, do you take medications for it?  Uh, not really.  Okay.  And your asthma, did it resolve when you were a child?  Uh, I think mostly, yeah.  I mean, sometimes when I, um, run for, like, long periods, it can, it can start up a bit, but, um, I have a, have, like, an asthma inhaler used for that.  Okay, so do you still have your inhalers?  Um, I think I might have one from like, a couple of months ago.  But you don't see your doctor regularly for asthma.  No, I don't.  Okay.  And apart from this, do you know if you're allergic to anything?  Uh not that I know of.  Okay.  And how far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment?  Sorry, could you repeat that?  How far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment?  Uh, they may be minutes drive away.  Okay, good.  So, given that you've had a history of asthma when you were a child,  and you get hay fever, sometimes in the summer.  Your shortness of breath.  Hi, I've lost video signal.  you still hear me?  Um, yeah, we've just turned.  So given you've got a history of asthma and hay fever,  This could be one of 2 things.  But we want to rule our asthma or an allergy first.  So what you'd need is visit one of our clinics so we can do some more tests.  Charles, check.  So the 1st thing we would do is use a small device on your finger to check the amount of oxygen in your blood?  Okay.  And from that, we can tell if it's asthma or something else.  Right, okay.  Before this happens, if you've got something like an antihistamine, which you normally take for hay fever at home, I would take one just in case it is an allergy you've had from the dust.  Okay.  Yeah, I don't have any antistamines at home, unfortunately.  You might be able to get one on your way to the doctor's surgery.  If not, they can prescribe you one.  Okay, okay, so I can just get it over the counter then.  Yes, and they're normally about 4 to 6 pounds.  Great.  Is there anything else that you're particularly worried about, want to ask me?  Um, um, not really.  I mean,  I have before taken steroids for asthma.  I don't know if that's relevant.  Yes, that is, and you may need to take some steroids now, but we cannot, we won't be able to know until we've done those tests first.  Okay.  Okay.  Cool.  So I'm going to write a letter for your GP just to let him know what's happened, and the consultation with the GP in person shouldn't take too long.  All right, how long do you think it will take?  Probably 10 minutes.  Okay, that's great.  Cool.  You should get the letter over the app and then we can you can take yourself to the GP.  Thank you very much.  Okay, bye.  Okay, thank you.  Bye bye.
