Hi.  Hello, hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon.  Hello.  Oh, hi.  Hi.  So, um, just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please?  Sure, my name is Mary Smith.  and your date of birth.  My date of birth is August 16th, 1976.  and your email address for me, please.  My email address is Mary Dr. Smith at gmail.com.  That's correct.  and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation.  Absolutely.  Right.  So you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw.  that correct?  Um, well,  I think that's just like the 1st thing that I typed, but it wasn't really what I, you know, I just typed it and then I clicked submit, so that was a, um, I mean, it's part of the problem, but I would say that more of a problem for me is that I can't quite move my left arm.  I mean, I can move it, but it's it's numb, and then I also feel some, like, tingling in my fingertips.  Okay, so I'm missing the left arm, yeah?  How long has it been going on for?  So, I've started taking this boxing class.  I've been taking a boxing class for a few weeks, and I feel like maybe, um, It's probably been, I'd say, for at least 2 weeks, and it's kind of gotten worse, like the beginning, I just kind of felt a little bit of tingling, and then it's gotten, it's gotten worse since then.  Then the numbing kind of started.  I can feel it both in my, uh, um, you know, a little bit in my elbow and then, in my arm as well as in my hand.  And now, because it hasn't gotten better.  I tried to get a massage.  It's not better or, you know, try to take warm baths.  It's not better.  So I figured I'd call you and and just figure out what's going on.  Right, so have you mentioned a massage and a wombat, any medications that you've taken so far?  Um, well, it's,  You know, it's, it's numb, and I, I kind of looked stuff online, um, but, you know, I do take ibuprofen just because my, my muscles were sore, uh, a little bit, and I've been taking this boxing class.  So, you know, I kind of heard like my knuckles on my right hand. So that's been a little bit painful.  So I've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that.  But, like I said, I mean, I tried massage.  I tried some hot baths, and that didn't help with this numbness.  I'm just kind of getting a little worried.  Of course.  So, you've just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards?  Is that, you know, the tingling numbness is elbow below, not from your shoulder.  Well, it's kind of funny.  you know, sometimes I will feel it in my shoulder, like if I try to, if I try to like, you know, move like in boxing and stuff,  I will even like, um, maybe feel a little bit of a little bit of pain.  Uh, but I would say if I'm just like resting, if I'm sitting like right now, I can feel like it's numb and I actually feel tingling right now, not in all of my fingers, just in some.  Yeah, so which fingers do you feel now?  Okay, so it's my second, third, and fourth finger.  Uh-huh, second, third, fourth finger.  And is it your palm side, or, you know, the back of your hand side, which is numb, or both?  No, it's it's the it's this side.  So the front side.  It's the front side.  Okay, right.  And have you been dropping things at all?  Like, you know, when you try to hold onto things like a glass or something?  Have you swapping it?  So not so much with the glass, but I will say, well, I play a little bit of a piano, and so I just noticed that it's been kind of harder to get the notes.  I can I can grasp.  I can grasp a glass, but because I use my right hand most of the time.  You know, I'm not left-handed, so I, it's kind of hard for me to.  So you would say there's a mild weakness.  Mind.  So just to get my facts, right?  So you say it's definitely weakness rather than because of the pain you can't hold it.  There's 2 different things.  So you know, sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you.  No, no, it's not hurting.  It's not hurting.  It's like numb, I can't feel it.  Right?  Okay. Yeah.  Fine, so you have definitely having some form of weakness.  Okay.  any neck pain at all.  No, not no neck pain.  No neck pain and all.  Okay, right.  Okay.  So just a bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system.  Um, do you have any past or medical history that you'd like to share?  Well, I guess because of this, you know, I'm not sure if it's boxing.  I also had a really bad cold like a month ago.  I mean, I was out, you know, drinking with friends, um, one of our coworkers just had his three year anniversary, and we kind of went crazy and we were like out partying until, you know, late hours and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me.  And then after that I was sick for probably good like 2 weeks, I was at home, I think I must have had some kind of like a flu or something.  So that, and then I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago is like, I all of a sudden just couldn't see from the, uh, from my left eye, like, I, I lost some, like a little bit of a field of vision.  Um, and but that, that just lasted not very long.  I mean, that just lasted maybe for, I don't know, 2020 minutes.  Uh, and I kind of thought, I don't know, maybe it was the, the cold, you know, and the virus and all that.  I guess that's what I can, you know, that's the last thing I can remember, but in general, I'm, I'm pretty healthy.  I mean, I, you know, I work out.  a lot and I don't really have any medical problems.  Do you have any headaches at all from the in the recent past?  Um, sometimes I get headaches, but I think they're just tired headaches, you know, sometimes I'll get kind of tired, but I think that's probably because I work too much, or, you know, because, like, I'll go for a workout, and then I'll really just exhaust myself, and then I just kind of feel this fatigue.  Or sometimes, like this morning, for example, I just felt really fatigued and I couldn't even get myself to the gym.  But, you know, since I have this numbness.  It's kind of like hard to work out, right?  Do you wear glasses at all?  glasses, contact lenses?  No, no, so no glasses.  Right.  and you've not had experienced anything like a seizure, fit anything like that.  What's a seizure?  Like when you you lose consciousness and you start shaking.  Oh, no, no, no, no, nothing like that.  No fits.  Yeah.  Okay.  And your weakness is only in your left arm.  The legs are walking and all is normal, yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, walking is normal, yeah.  You mentioned for a while, you couldn't see, you know, the outside peripheral vision from your left eye.  How long did that episode last?  You know, I think it was only maybe like 20 minutes or so.  It's almost like it happened, and I thought, oh my God,  it's probably, I'm still, like, sick from this, you know, virus thing cold, and so I just kind of slapped it off, and then when I, uh, um, when I woke up, it was gone.  Sure, okay.  Um, okay, so is there any regular medications that you're using?  Not really.  I just take hypoprofen every once in a while.  I take vitamin D.  um, I take some, I, I, like, my Jeep, my GP really wants me to take iron supplements, but, you know, there are this, like, huge pills, so I, I most of the time I just forget.  But vitamin D I take, and then sometimes I take melatonin to help me sleep.  Okay.  And any family history you'd like to share?  Any significant family history?  I know that my dad has, I don't know if it's hypo, I think it's hypothyroidism.  And then my, like he's got some autoimmune stuff going on, like that much, I know.  And then my mom, my mom, she's, she's actually not in a great shape.  She's got diabetes type too.  She's got hypertension.  um, she's got, gosh, what is it?  Oh, yeah, she's got high cholesterol, um, and I think that's it for her.  Yeah.  Right. Any neurological conditions in the family.  Uh, they are related.  conditions.  Okay, that's fine.  Okay.  So, right.  So after, you know, speaking and examining, you know, yourself on there, I think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further.  I'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the box in here.  Okay, a few things that made me think other than just like a boxing injury is, for instance, um, you know, when you said you can't, your vision went, apparently vision was not there for about 20.  So, and that with the weakness of the arms make me think, is there something else going on rather than just injury?  What do you think maybe going on?  Sometimes, you know, you do get things like MS, multiple sclerosis.  So people, multiple sclerosis can have visual problems, like what you've experienced, and sometimes, you know, the odd, numbness, tingling sensations going on.  Okay. Will I be in wheelchair?  If we catch it a bit early, there are treatments for it.  Okay?  I'm not, obviously, I'm not suggesting that you do have it, but it is quite important to find out that whether you have it or not.  That's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be dealt with here.  Yeah?  So what we can do is I'm going to do an urgent, very urgent neurology referral.  Yeah?  Well, that might entail is the brain scan and things like that.  Hello?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm here.  I here.  I know this it might sound a bit of a shock to you.  But I think it is important that we investigate this a bit more seriously.  Alright.  that makes sense.  Okay, any questions at all?  Well, what's, okay, so you're going to do the referral.  Should I be taking any drugs or? No, that's something, we can't do, the treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that, when you have an acutie, you know, acute reaction or things like that, but saying that 1st we need to adopt firm diagnosis. Yeah?  while you're waiting for this to be done, if there's any weakness,  you know, if the weakness progresses to your legs, or there's any kind of headaches, vomiting, fits, and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better, then that would be an ANE.  Okay, got it.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you, doctor.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I do appreciate you are a bit worried, but you know, it's good that we know that you've come and spoken to us today, and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling.  Okay?  Thank you, doctor.  appreciate your time.  That's okay. You take  Bye bye.  Bye, now.  Bye.
