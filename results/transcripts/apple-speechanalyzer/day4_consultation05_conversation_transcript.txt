Hello?  Hi, hi, can you hear me?  Hi, my name's Dr. Gohill.  I one of the doctors that works at Babylon.  Can I...  Can I check your name and date of birth, please?  Yes, my name is Roberto Mendoza.  Okay.  I was born on the 1st of January of 1992.  Okay, and are you in a space that's quiet and you're able to talk?  Oh, sorry.  I, um, over 1990,  sorry, I'm 48  Sorry, I forgot that.  So you're 48?  and are you able to talk at the moment?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Tell me, it says here, you have a, you're having problems going to the toilet?  Yeah, so I have a, I have a, I don't know how do you say it properly in English.  I mean, with Sanigulga, like diarrhoea.  Yeah, so it's lasting for like 3 days.  and uh, yeah, I, I don't know.  I don't know what would cause it.  um,  Uh, I have a bit of pain, nominal pain, and I had a bit of vomiting.  and uh, uh,  Yeah.  But these are kind of like the, what is happening to me.  Okay.  Tell me how you were 3 days ago before they started.  Did you have any medical problems?  Uh, so I have, I have, I have a, asthma, and I take some, uh, some, um, inhaler.  I don't know, uh, I take an inhaler, um, you said, and, um, I have an allergy.  I have an NKDA allergy.  I don't know if it's because, I don't know,  and apart from asthma, do you have anything else?  Uh, I don't know, maybe it's well, because, you know, it's this thing here in the stomach stuff, I always have in the back of my head at my father, because he died about 10 years ago of all cancer.  Okay.  So, yeah, this is kind of the, my, my worries, I don't know.  Okay, so you've had the diarrhoea for 3 days.  and now you're having acne pain and vomiting.  Yes, yes.  Was the diarrhoea been getting better or less?  Uh, I think he's not getting better awards.  It's kind of like, uh, like, either, like normal.  Like, it hasn't gone away.  It hasn't worsen.  Okay.  and how often do you go to the toilet?  I go.  I need to go.  I can't go to work because I need to go like every, I don't know if this feeling like I go to a toilet and then when I finish, I need to, I feel I need to go again.  Okay. and yeah, so I need to be like close to the toilet. that must be hard.  Yeah, yeah.  You had to drink more water than normal.  Ah, I don't know.  Maybe I'm not drinking enough water.  Yeah.  I drink I think I, yeah, I don't know.  I think I don't drink any water.  An important question.  have you noticed any blood?  Uh, no, I haven't noticed any, any problem.  And you mentioned tummy pain.  Can you tell me more about your tummy pain, like where it is, and if it goes anywhere?  So, the band is mainly, uh, focus in, in the centre area of the domain, like, under the belly, under the belly bottom, yeah, and sometimes I can hear my stomach, like, the crumbs, yeah.  We've been able to eat and drink.  Uh, yes, but I, I go to the toilet so often, so I, I, I, yeah, I try not to eat a lot because I, yeah, I just go into toilet every 10 minutes.  And you said the tummy pains in the middle of your tummy.  anywhere else?  No, no, just there.  And it seems to be alleviated.  toilet and maybe it's like trap gas.  I don't know what it is, but  Okay.  And when was the last time you vomited?  I think it was this morning, this morning, I, but the thing is like, because I'm not eating anything now.  So, I haven't vomited again.  Did you have any breakfast?  I don't know.  I didn't.  No, sorry, yes, I did, actually.  I did.  hold on.  I had from. I had from.  Okay, and you've vomited that up afterwards?  and afterwards, I didn't have anything, then I got a bit of nausea, and I vomited, and then, uh, and I was it, and I haven't.  So now I'm, I think I'm okay, but uh, yeah, I don't, yeah.  Did you notice any blood when you vomit?  I think I do.  I think I do, but this, uh, no, no.  I can't say, sorry, I'm sorry.  I, I, I don't think there is blood because, uh, yeah, it was, it was a strawberries that I was having for breakfast, so, so, yeah, it wasn't close.  Okay. and um,  Did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain?  Are you, I don't know.  To be honest, sometimes I have, when I get a bit of anxiety, I use my inhaler.  but my inhaler kind of run out the one because, you know, I'm a foreigner.  So I have this brand, but I bought a new one here.  And I don't know, maybe this new one has caused it.  It's a problem.  don't know.  Okay, it's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this.  Normally it's when you eat bad food or food that has gone off.  and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested.  But just to double check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing?  Uh, I, I always have problems with my breeding because of the asthma, like, when I, I need to use my inhaler a little bit, but a part of the normal, I haven't, I haven't.  Okay. And how about chest?  Have you noticed any chest paint?  No, I haven't, I haven't noticed any chest pain.  Okay.  And how about walking and talking, are those all both okay?  Uh, walking and talking, uh, yes.  Yes, I, I, but yeah, I don't work very far because I, yeah, I need to, I need to go to a toilet now and then, so I'm spending some time at home.  And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain?  Oh, it does a little bit.  Okay.  Sorry, I was just writing some things down.  So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain.  Okay, and it's norm- this is normally called gastroenteritis.  So in infection over the tummy.  Oh okay.  Normally, when patients have this, we have to do 3 things.  Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids, because you're losing lots at the moment.  Number 2 is to make sure and look out for any fevers.  So if you start getting a temperature, then you need to optional fetamol.  and 3 is stay home for the time being until you get slightly better.  Okay.  And normally, I, yeah, normally things like antibiotics don't help, they make the situation worse.  Okay. So that's...  Go ahead.  No, I was saying I didn't have any fever recently.  I was sweating a little bit glass for bed, but I, I, not sure if, if I had a bit of fever, but very little, or, but I don't think so.  I don't know, maybe.  So I think that's what we should do for the time being.  If you feel you're getting much worse, then I would suggest you go and see your GP in real, in real life in pattern.  so they can look at your belly.  Okay, I will, yeah, I will book then.  I will wait a couple of days to see or one more day and then I will book.  Go ahead.  Do you have any more questions for me?  Uh, no, that's, that's it.  I was maybe just concerned about my father's medical history, if that would, uh, could add some kind of risk.  So the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had.  But if your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look up from the GP.  Okay.  Does that sound okay?  Yeah, that sounds good.  That sounds good.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, look.  Bye-bye.  Bye bye.
