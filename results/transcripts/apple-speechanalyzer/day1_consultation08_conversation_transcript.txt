Um, so basically, I've been really stressed at work for the past few days, and I've realised that I've got really dry, itchy skin.  Okay. um, sorry to hear, work's been so stressful.  Tell me more about your skin first, Lou.  you mentioned it's been dry and itchy.  Whereabouts in your skin?  All over my arms, um, are my hands mainly?  Okay.  and is this something you've had before?  I know.  So did it, did it come about quite suddenly or was it more kind of a gradual thing?  I think it started a few days ago.  Okay.  and has it spread anywhere else?  Who spread your to your chest, your legs, your face?  No, okay.  So apart from being dry and itchy.  Any other symptoms has been sore?  has it been?  Have you noticed any cracked skin?  Um, so my skin is quite red.  Um, and I'm using coconut butter the past few days.  Okay. I got any spots.  Okay. No fever, please.  I'm not forgotten either.  Thank you.  mentioning all those.  Okay.  So the coconut butter hasn't helped with an itch.  No. Okay.  And you mentioned work's been quite stressful.  What do you do for work?  I work as a teacher.  Okay.  and in what way has work been stressful?  I think the kids have been really annoying these days.  Okay, well...  Okay.  All right, well, I'm sorry to hear that, and I hope it gets better.  Going back to your skin.  Is it anything you've done, perhaps, which may have triggered your symptoms, anything you've touched, or, you know, for example, shower gels, soaps, fabric fabric cleaners?  I went swimming a few days ago.  Okay. Is that the first time in your life or have you been before?  And now I've been before.  Okay.  And did your symptoms start after you went swimming?  Yes, good.  Okay, all right.  You mentioned you've had no other fevers.  Is that right?  No fevers, no vomiting.  No.  No.  How's your health otherwise?  It's pretty good.  Yeah, I'm not on any medication.  We'll get some medication just a second.  Do you feel Jenny rundown?  you feel tired?  Uh, yeah, I think I have been quite tired.  Okay. Okay.  Are you eating and drinking, okay?  Yeah, I've been drinking when eating is normal.  Your appetite's fine.  is it okay?  and your bells, are your bells working okay?  Yeah.  No, no problems with vomiting or loose stools.  No.  Okay.  and your waterworks are all okay.  your past urine okay?  Yep. Okay.  All right.  So just moving on.  In terms of your other medical history,  anything else I should be aware of?  I'm currently taking my question.  Michael Guidon?  Yeah.  Okay, do you know what that is?  Uh, no.  Okay.  It's a contraceptive pill.  Does that make sense?  Is that something you, does that ring a bell now?  Oh, yes.  Any other medications that you take?  I know.  No.  So in terms of your medication, there's no problems of skin problems in the past, things like eczema or dermatitis,  No, I think it might just be the weather.  Sorry, what was that? You think it's? I think it might just be the weather.  The weather?  Yeah.  Oh, you think the weather? Okay, you think the weather? Okay.  No, it's okay.  no problems.  Move.  do you suffer from allergies?  Are you someone who suffered some allergies?  fruit allergies, medication allergies?  I think, um, am I lactose intolerant?  That is intolerant.  okay  that could be helpful to me.  Um, fine.  In terms of family history,  Is there anything of family that you're aware of?  Um, yeah, so, um, my dad has asthma, and my mum has a paper.  Hey, fever.  Yep, okay.  Um, fine.  Any, again, any skin problems I should be aware of?  Uh, no.  No, okay, all right.  Socially, who do you live with at home?  Live alone?  Yep. and do you smoke at all?  Can I ask, do you smoke?  Are you a smoker?  No, I don't smoke.  Have you drink much in a robe alcohol?  I know.  Recreational drugs?  you work as a primary school teacher?  Yes, that's right. The reason I ask is something stress can be a contributing factor.  You felt, you noticed yourself, your life's been more stressful recently.  right.  Do you think that might have any correlation to your symptoms?  I certainly think so.  Okay, all right.  Um, fine.  Okay, well, normally at least I'd like to proceed examination, but based on your story,  It's difficult.  And I think, you know, you've essentially the stories you've got dry, itchy rash on your hands, you mentioned, and your arms, which started perhaps after swimming a few days ago.  Um, but no other symptoms you're feeling otherwise, well, no fevers, no bleeding or discharge from skin.  I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis.  Have you heard of that condition before?  I have, yeah.  Okay.  Great.  Well, I can give you a patient information leaf note about that, which gives a bit more information about the disease, but it's something that we can readily treated with a couple of options.  You have steroid creams I can give you.  which will help with the inflammation.  and something called emollions, which can help with the dry skin.  and that's something you just need to kind of paste on onto your skin throughout the day for the next few days, and hopefully that helps your symptoms.  Okay, cool.  thank you very much  Um, you can also try antihistamines, so you can get things over the counter, Puritan, Laratidine, that can someone's help with the itchiness.  Yeah, that sounds good.  Okay, and that's probably what I recommend.  Paracetical on this occasion wouldn't be helpful.  painkillers wouldn't be helpful on this occasion.  But let's see how the next few days go.  And if it's still not getting better, come back and see me next week and we can have another look again.  symptoms.  Okay, perfect.  Thank you very much.  Right, do you have any questions for me?  I know.  Okay.  Well, wish you all the best.  have a good day  Oh thank you very much.  Bye-bye.
