I'm a little bit worried about it.  I'm not sure what to do.  Right, well, thank you for coming into.  hopefully we can help with your symptoms.  As you mentioned, it started a few days ago.  So can you tell me a bit more about what kind of pain it is that you're experiencing?  Um, it's, it's not too bad.  It's sort of like a stinging kind of pain.  Um, it's not like unbearable, but, uh, it's, it's definitely, uh, it definitely bothers me, my P, um,  and uh, yeah, I also maybe sometimes get some, like, pain kind of lowered down in my tummy when I, when I go to the bathroom.  Yeah. and the pain in your tummy is it can describe the pain to me?  Is it cramping, burning, sharp?  Um, yeah, I don't know.  Maybe, uh, sort of sort of cramping?  I not really sure, but it's not like, it's not like cramped, like when I get, when I have a period or something.  like, I don't know.  Okay, fine.  And have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal?  Um, not, I don't think so.  haven't noticed.  No, okay, fine.  Community, any funny colour few urines?  has it been any blood in your urine?  Have you noticed any other darkening of urine?  Um, there was a little bit of blood earlier today.  um, but besides that, not at all, no, um, it does kind of, it, it kind of like, doesn't smell very, it smells a bit weird, I guess, um, but, no, not really anything, uh, anything drastic.  Okay, going, okay.  Right, let me just write a few notes down as well.  Fine.  And you mentioned a tummy pain, that also started a few days ago.  Does the pain move anywhere else?  Is it new towards the back or towards your flank, the sides?  No, not really, no.  No, okay.  fine.  With the symptoms, have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting?  Uh, no, not, not at all.  Okay, any fevers or temperatures?  Sorry, any fevers or temperatures?  Sorry I didn't hear you.  No, no no fever.  No fever.  Okay, fine.  Sorry.  Okay.  In terms of your bowel?  are your bowels making okay?  Um, I think so, yeah.  Any diarrhoea, loose stool?  No, not that I, not that I've noticed at all.  Okay, all right.  And Jessica, sometimes we have to ask very private, sensitive questions just to go get full history.  Um, hope you don't mind me on.  Are you currently sexually active?  Yeah, I am.  Okay, in that with a regular partner?  Um, yeah, so I've had a boyfriend for about a couple months now, yeah.  Fine, okay.  Have you noticed any other discharge from down below?  No, okay.

Uh, yeah, we use condoms.  use condoms, okay.  And when would you lost period?  A couple weeks ago.  Is there any chance you could be pregnant, perhaps?  Say again? Any chance you could be pregnant?  Uh, I don't think so.  It's always worth asking young females like yourself.  So if that obviously, if you are worried about the pain,  not getting any better, and then I will always advise you doing a pregnancy test to rule that pregnancy.  Okay?  Fine.  moving on, moving on.  Are you otherwise fitting well?  Um, yeah, I think I'm feeling okay otherwise, yeah.  And so by that, I mean, do you have any other medical problems?  medical history.  Um, so in the past, I've had some, uh, some IBS, um, but other than that, I think no, like, uh, no serious medical problems that seem, yeah.  Do you take any regular medications?  Uh, no, I did a, I did a little bit ago or a couple days ago, try some over-the-counter bicarbonate to try and help with the pain, but it wasn't, it wasn't really helping.  Okay, so you tried that and didn't help.  Okay, all right.  Germany allergies, any medications?  Uh, yeah, I'm allergic to Clindamycin.  And what happens when you take Kinder Mycin?  Um, I I get some like a swelling, basically.  It seems like a quite severe allergy to it.  that right?  Okay.  Fine. In terms of your family history?  Is there anything I should be aware of?  relates to kidneys, bladder, bowels, guts.  Uh, no, I don't think so.  Not anything I know about.  Okay, all right.  And tell a bit more about your home situation.  Who's at home with you?  Um, so I live in a living a flat near my college with a couple like friends of mine.  Uh, so I'm, I'm not like living at home or anything.  Um, what you're asking about, sorry.  Okay.  and are you are you working alone or are you a student?  I'm a student  Okay, and what are you studying?  I'm studying biology.  And how's that going?  Um, it's good.  Yeah, it's really, it's really interesting uh, learning about how, how the world works.  Yeah.  Great.  Do you have any aspirations for the future in terms of careers?  Uh, I don't know.  Maybe a doctor someday.  never know.  I recommend it. Reading doctors.  What about smoking and alcohol?  Do you drink much away of, did you smoke or do you drink much away of alcohol?  Uh, I don't, I don't smoke.  I do drink like on weekends.  Yeah, so socially.  Okay.  All right.  Right, excellent.  So, at this, I would proceed to examination.  But based on your story, just to summarise, really, it's the last 3 days you've been having a bit of burning pain on passing urine, a bit of crampy tummy pain lower down.  Um, essentially, but no other fevers or back pain, uh, if I understand correctly.  I think we probably do have what we call a simple UTI or a urine tract infection, bladder infection, which can be readily treated.  So I'll give you a course of antibiotics today.  Some things called either nitrofur and towing or trimethaprin.  and it's normally a 3 day course.  So one tab it twice a day for 3 days.  And should help your symptoms.  but also advise you to drink plenty of fluids.  Let's try and flush that, you know, that infection out of your body, if you can.  You can try cranberry juice, that can sometimes help with your symptoms.  And if you're still not better by the end of this week,  I want you to give me a call or come back and see me, and we can have another look at your symptoms.  Okay, so 3 days of the medication and then wait a little bit if it still doesn't go away.  Call back.  Yeah absolutely.  And things to look out for would be, you know, if you are having kind of high temperatures, back pain, just genuinely feeling more unwell, you know, do when you give me a callback, because then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we want to avoid.  So do give me a call if you have any concerns, okay?  Okay, is there, is there anything like, like, should I be worried about, like, not having sex or anything within the next week or anything like this?  I mean, if you can try and avoid it, I think that'll be sensible.  he's greatly using barrier conception, I recommend you to continue using barrier contraception.  But if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up, that'll probably be the best for you and your boyfriend.  Okay, all right.  That makes sense.  Great.  Okay, thank you so much.  wish you all the best.  Yeah, thank you.
