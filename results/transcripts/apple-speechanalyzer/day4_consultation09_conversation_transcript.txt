Oh, hello.  Hi, how you doing?  My name's Joe.  I'm one of the doctors here at Bablon.  Can I just confirm your name, please?  Yeah, Daniel.  Hi Daniel.  and your date of birth?  Yeah, male. 1992.  Okay, Daniel.  And are you in a comfortable and confidential place to talk?  Yeah, totally happy to go ahead.  Great.  can I help?  Yeah, I just, my chest has been feeling really tight.  Okay.  And how long has this been going for, Daniel?  Uh, for about 3 hours now?  Okay.  and so tight chest for 3 hours.  and so you were born in 92, so it makes you 26.  26, yeah.  And you are any shortness of breath at all like that?  Yeah, like a little bit.  Yeah, a little bit short of breath.  not too bad  Any cough, wheeze?  Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well, coffee, coffee, yeah.  Flight cough, yeah.  Yeah.  Sore throat, runny nose, soy.  You know, I had a cold last week, and it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat.  I had a runny nose, just feeling under the weather.  You feeling better now than the tight chest?  I mean, I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore.  Right, okay, okay, but you know, no, you've got this, so you've still got, still got symptoms of a cold, essentially.  Yeah, the cops kind of stuck around.  Are you coughing up anything?  No.  And, um, do you have any other medical problems like asthma?  Yeah, yeah, I have asthma.  I've had it for a while now.  and then I have like a hay fever, you know, some allergies to dust.  Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any medications?  Um, yeah, so, uh, you know, the, um, uh, Ventalin, it's called uh, Salbutamol.  Yeah. I got that one, and then I have a steroid, uh, clennel, clennel inhaler.  And have you been using Kernel and the Ventolin and how often you've been using them?  Um, well, to be honest, I was away at uni last week, and I forgot to bring it with me, so I haven't really in the past week.  Because, sorry, they ran out and I forgot to go and grab the next one.  Yeah, sure. about a week ago.  Okay. All right.  All right.  So you haven't got any clinal or any ventolin at the moment?  Not with me right now until I ran out.  Okay.  All right.  Any drug allergies, you know? No, no, not allergic to anything.  Just like just the dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs.  Okay, great.  Now, do you, anyone in your family had any medical problems you know of?  Um, yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma.  Oh, when I was young, I also had eczema and I had a milk protein allergy.  when I was young too.  Um  So, just, uh, do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or, um, hopes for this consultation?  Not really, like, I feel like asthma is probably a part of it, and probably getting my inhalers would be helpful.  Um, it's just kind of scary because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight uh, in a long time.  Yeah, absolutely.  I can I can imagine.  Well, it certainly sounds like you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough, and it's non-productive cough, and you're short of death.  Is the cough worse at nighttime?  I mean, it gets a little bit worse tonight, but basically just pretty consistent.  It hasn't gone away.  and you've got this tight tight chest.  But you even say you've got chest paint as more a tight chest, is that?  No, not really paint.  It's more like tight.  It just feels like sometimes you can't get a full breath in, you know?  Yeah, sure. Okay, well, I would quite like to certainly get you some ventolin, clinal modulate.  Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past?  Not in a long time.  when I was young, a little bit more, like, back in high school, but I've been pretty good at taking my inhalers, so not, not so much anymore.  Have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient as in, you know, stayed in there overnight for asthma?  Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat.  Oh, okay.  So you, so you, uh, you went to hospital and had a, uh, so you stayed in hospital for a few days, did you with an asthma exacerbation?  Yeah, I did, yeah. Okay, but currently you're just on ventilin and clinol, and you haven't got any of those storage, those inhalers at the moment.  That'd be pretty good.  I'd be pretty good, just on the kennel and the subbutum.  When, sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma dissipation?  Uh, I think I was like 17?  16, 80?  Okay.  Just to quantify how short of breath you are.  I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you?  No, you won't have, will you?  Are you able to, like, walk up, flight of stairs, okay, walk on the flat, okay, without getting too short of breath, or are you sure of breath of rest?  I'm definitely not short of breath at rest.  Like, except for that feeling out of describing.  It does when I'm walking upstairs, I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be.  Yeah, okay, but you're not sure a breath at rest at the moment.  No, no, no, I'm not.  Okay, fine.  So, what I think, um, and just, just go over.  Is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the prescription for your inhalers?  Was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting from this?  I just want to know that I'm okay to just, like, keep, I just don't want to have to get that intubation again.  Sure. Yeah. No, absolutely.  Well, I'm really glad you've talked to me today.  I think what we can do is give you a prescription for some more of the inhalers.  We can get that to you within the hour, I would hope.  and I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids.  So these are tablets which you can take for 5 days, 2 tablets in the morning, and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response, okay?  Okay. Now, there are some side effects to the steroids, which I should really tell you about, but please read the label, as associated with, don't be too worried about the side effects, they're most, you know, most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated.  and you prob- have you had them in the past you know of?  Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there.  What were you saying?  Have you had steroids in the past?  Um, I can't remember.  Probably.  Probably, yeah, I would probably.  So, um, they, they can come, they can make you, your mood change, can be slightly low or slightly high, can give you a high blood sugar, um, and, uh, they can also cause rationals, yeah.  headaches, but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help you ask for an awful lot.  What I like to do is send you these, some prescriptions for your inhalers are ongoing.  So, um, you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can, you can use the clinal modulate in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN, but so, uh, a Ventolin when you need to, um, when you're getting with it.  If you should start to use the Ventolin more than every 3 hours, at any time, it's a good idea to seek medical attention.  So, see a doctor in some capacity.  Uh, and the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better.  Have you, do you know what space it is?  you used one before?  Yeah, yeah.  Somebody told me how to use it on a while ago.  I don't really use it, to be honest, but...  Have you got one?  I think I do.  I have one somewhere  Okay. All right.  Well, I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially, a couple of puffs to prime it inside, breathing in and out.  for 5 or 10 breaths.  Okay. Yeah.  So, uh, was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage?  think you got me covered.  Okay.  and might give you some time off work as well.  You can sell certified for 7 days, but I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better if you're okay.  All right.  Alrighty.  Well thank you very much.  No worries.  Any deterioration, new symptoms, like worstening shortness of breath, or just generally concerning symptoms, pain, new chest, tightness, feeling lightheaded, then seek further medical attention anytime, please.  Okay.  Alright, sounds good.  Okay, thank you.  Okay, thank you.  Bye bye.  Bye-bye.
