Um, well, 5 days ago, I started having problems like a cough and my nose is just constantly streaming.  Okay.  and are you normally fit and well?  Yeah, normally I'm diabetic, but other than that, like generally pretty good.  Right, okay, so just tell me about the last, did you say 5 days?  Yeah, 5 days or so ago.  Okay, how bad's your cough at the moment?  Uh, it's quite bad.  kind of quite dry.  um,  I'm coughing maybe every 20, 30 minutes or so.  Okay, you bringing up any phlegm at all?  No.  Nope.  Any chest room?  Chest, what, sorry?  Any pain in your chest?  Uh, no.  Any difficulty breathing, feeling short of breath, or any pain when you take a deep breath?  No that's all fine.  Have you coughed up any blood or anything like that?  And what about your no symptoms?  On the front of the sinuses or anything?  Nothing up in here, but just constant streaming, like using a 1000000 tissues.  Okay, and any blood coming from the nose?  No, it's pretty green.  Right, okay.  Any other symptoms, like sore ears, sore throat.  I have, I've been feeling really hot.  I don't know if it's fever as such, but, like, to touch, I'm quite hot, but sometimes I'm feeling really chilly, needing to be under a blanket, that sort of thing.  Have you affected your temperature with a thermometer?  No, I haven't.  Okay.  and are you eating and drinking normally?  Uh, yes, um, kind of, around when it started, I had some diarrhoea, but I don't know if that was associated, but since then it's all been pretty fine.  Okay, so you're drinking while holding down fluids, okay?  Yeah.  and passing water okay?  Yeah, that's fine.  vomiting diarrhoea now.  Okay, that's fine.  Any rushes? But you've noticed?  Rashes.  Yeah.  No, nothing like that.  Any headaches or changing your vision?  No, I've had quite achy muscles, but that's pretty much it.  Okay.  And normally, do you have any chess problems?  Uh no.  Do you ever get wheezing, short of breath?  I mean, like, if I do intense exercise, and yes, but not normal.  And do you regularly have any infections in your chest or anything that needs treatment normally?  No, I've got hypertension.  so I'm on some drugs for that.  but that's it, really.  Okay.  Any other medical problems?  Uh, just the high potential and the diabetes.  Okay, and what type of drugs are you one?  Uh, I think something called Metformin, uh, and Lisinapril, I think is the other one.  Okay, and when did you last have your blood pressure checked?  Uh, oh, uh, a while ago.  Do you know the order? Do you know if it's been stable?  I can't remember.  Okay.  and with your blood with your diabetes.  Have you had a blood test recently?  Um,  Yeah.  Like,  Yeah, it was normal.  It was around 3 weeks ago.  Okay.  And do you know what dose of the Lysinopro you're taking?  Uh, 200?  Okay.  Have you been able to pass water normally?  Any increase in in frequency that you're passing water or any increased thirst?  Uh no, not particularly.  and has your weight been stable?  Yeah.  What is your weight and height?  My height is 5 foot 5?  and my weight is 65 kilogrammes?  Okay.  And do you smoke at all?  No, you drink any alcohol?  Yes, the odd sherry.  Okay.  and who do you live with at home?  My partner and my dog.  do you work?  Uh, yes.  I'm an office manager.  Okay.  And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms, anything that you've bought in the chemist?  Um, uh, quite a few lem sips.  Um, it seems to be helping.  Do you, what do you mean by quite a few?  How many in a day do you normally take?  Maybe 2 or 3 maybe like at the start of the day and at the end of the day?  Okay.  Have you noticed any improvement in that?  Yeah, it tends to soothe my throat a bit?  when I'm going to sleep?  Okay.  Um, do you have any allergies to anything?  Sometimes suffer from some, like, hay fever, but it's not too bad.  Any allergies, 20 medications at all?  Not that I'm aware of, no?  Okay.  So, what you've described to me, it sounds like you, you probably have got an infection in the chest, um, because it's, it, you know, you're obviously getting the symptoms of, from your nose and your chest.  Um, it sounds like you might have a high temperature, so it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature.  I can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something.  Yeah.  Most of the time, these infections are caused by viruses.  So they do normally settle by themselves, but can take, you know, a week or 2  and you can persistently have the cough ongoing longer than that.  The important thing to do would be to check your temperature.  Um, and if you feel like if the temperature's ongoing above 37.5, 38, um, and you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down, or your cough's getting worse, you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming up your nose, um, or any shorts of breath, chest pain, then we certainly would need to speak to you again.  With the diabetes, you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes.  So it's something that we do need to be careful of.  Okay, so then we would look at potentially antibiotics at that time, perhaps.  Yeah, potentially, if it's not settling or the temperature's ongoing, getting worse, then we definitely need to talk to you again.  Have you got any other questions?  Um, no, that's all fine.  It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment with the lem sip.  I wouldn't take, and that's that contains paracetamol, so don't take any other paracetamol containing products.  with that at the same time.  The cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime, it's best for your body if you just keep coughing, but if you're kept up all night, and you can't sleep at all, then it's okay to have a little bit of cough syrup just to settle that down.  Okay, cool.  Okay.  Do you have blood sugar, checking, equipment?  I'm not at home.  No.  Okay.  Well, if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your GPs uh ask you for.  Okay, great.  All right, then, take care.  Thanks so much.  Bye.
