Interesting.  Hello.  Hi.  My name is Dr. Kumar.  one of the GPs here.  Can I just get you to confirm your name and date of birth for me, please?  Uh, yeah, I'm Maria.  Yeah.  Sorry?  And your date of birth?  Um, 27 of March of um, 90.  again, how can I help today?  Um, so I'm having like a really, really strong headache.  I don't know what is happening.  I'm quite concerned.  So it started in the morning.  Um, I feel like, um, uh, dizzy.  uh, my vision is a little bit blurred.  Um, like, it's, it's really painful and I'm getting really concerned, especially because I'm having like these, uh, changes in the vision.  Okay, so it started this morning with a sudden onset headache, did it come on suddenly?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  and did it come on really bad or did it start off, uh, like a slight headache and build up to a severe headache?  It came like kind of suddenly.  And if you, if 10 is the worst pain you've ever felt in your life, how bad would you say the pain was between one and 10?  Well, I had the kidney stone, so let's say that that's 10.  um, I have now, maybe five, well, 66 probably.  But it's more about me being really concerned because this is very weird.  Okay, no, that's fine.  Have you ever had a headache before?  Sorry?  Have you ever had a headache like this in the past?  Um, well, not really.  Like this, yeah, like this?  No, definitely.  It's something new.  Okay, okay. If you had the same where, across the head, the headache is, is across the front, round the back?  It's in one side, the left side only.  And tell me what visual problems are you getting?  My vision is quite blurry.  Um, it's, it's really weird.  like some zigzag lines.  Okay, kind of, I don't know how to describe it properly.  Okay.  and have you tried any painkillers for this already?  Yeah, I tried paracetamol, but it didn't work.  To be honest, I feel exactly the same.  Okay.  Okay.  Um, what time did you take the parity tomorrow?  how long ago was it you taking it?  Uh, well, uh, the, the, had they started like 4 year, 4 hours ago, so I would say like maybe 3 hours ago, because I couldn't stand it.  Okay.  Um, and your visual problems is still ongoing now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I feel a little bit, a little bit, looking, I cannot stand screens.  Um, but yeah, definitely.  and when I move, like, the thing is that if I, if I leave bed, I start to feel, like, even worse if I move.  So I just want to have my head, my head like really, uh, not moving.  Okay, okay.  Um, so what about, have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I forgot to mention, definitely.  I vomit twice.  Actually, as soon as the headache started, I also vomited.  So initially I thought it was something that I ate, but then the headache started to be really bad and I still feel nausea.  So we are, I'm about to vomit very soon, I think.  All right.  okay.  You've mentioned in the past you've had kidney stones.  Any other medical problems?  Sorry?  You've mentioned that in the past, you've had kidney stones?  Have you had any other medical problems in the past?  So, uh, uh, not actually, uh, my mother has migraines.  I'm not sure if that's relevant.  And also, I have hypotyroidism in the family.  So it might be, I don't know, I don't know.  What else do you have in the family?  I think we are losing connection.  Sorry, I think we lost connection.  Oh, can you still hear me?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can hear me.  You said you mentioned your mother has migraines.  What else do you have in the family?  Hyper tyrant.  hyperthas.  She also has hypotyrism.  Okay, fine.  Okay.  Um, and no other relevant family history.  Uh, no, not that I'm aware.  And do you take any regular medications?  Uh, no.  Are you allergic to any medications?  Not that I'm aware.  Yeah, not that I'm aware.  Okay, is there any chance he could be pregnant?  Uh, I really doubt it.  And so you're not allergic to any medications, fine from.  And what were you thinking might be going on?  I know you seem quite worried about it.  Was there anything in particular you were worried about?  Well, I'm a little bit hypochondriac, so I feel that this can be some kind of brain tumour, tumour or something because I'm like, this is really, the pain is so worryable that, or maybe a stroke.  I don't know.  It's it's just like, you know, you hear so many stories that you definitely start to wonder if I should go to any urgently because I might really have something serious.  Okay, fine.  Um, now, just another question.  Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs, anything like that?  No, no, no, no.  And when you're walking, you're able to walk fine in a straight line or is your, you're a walk.  Are you walking a bit funny?  Uh, not really.  Okay. It's really about the head.  That's why I find it very weird.  Okay, so just to clarify, what you said this morning, you woke up and then later on in the morning, about 4 hours ago, you've developed a headache, looking on the left side of the head.  Yeah, left side of the hay.  behind the eye.  Sorry?  Is it behind the eye?  Is that where the pain is?  Uh, no, no, it's, uh, I don't know to describe it, but it's just like, um, you've also been from China.  Okay, that's fine.  You've noticed that your vision is blurry, there's funny lines, you feel a bit nauseous, you vomited twice.  and you're feeling dizzy as well, but you've got no neurological symptoms, you're walking fine.  and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped.  Is that what?  Okay.  Yeah, so it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine.  Is that something you've heard of before?  Uh, no, it's the 1st time.  Okay.  I'm very familiar with the DTs because my mother has it, so, uh, well, but I never had it, and I thought that the onset of migraine will be, you know, in much early ages.  So, that's why I'm not sure if migraine makes sense.  Okay. So, um, usually with, with migraines, they can present at different times in people's lives, so sometimes they can't present as a child.  sometimes it can present when they're older.  and sometimes I can present, you know, even postmenopausally.  So there's different, there's different ways you can get migraines.  And the reason why this sounds like migrators because it's on one side of the head.  typical of a migraine.  You've got blurry vision, again, which is very typical with a nausea and formiting.  also typical of a migraine.  Now, obviously, if the headache is really severe, and I'll suggest some medications you can try.  If that doesn't work, we would want to see you as soon as possible to do like a full neurological exam as well.  Oh, that's great. to make sure that, you know, there's, you know, when we do a more specific examination that everything all seems fine.  I would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you, it can take some medications, maybe something like ibuprofen. Okay, so, and you're saying that if this is a migraine, and if I try that medication, this should go away kind of today.  So, yes, a migraine, yeah, not, you know, even sooner than that, we can look at maybe half an hour to 40 minutes, depending on what your response to it is. For some people, whatever medications they take, the migraine doesn't improve, and it can last from anywhere, from 4 hours to 72 hours, migraines can last.  Um, but I would... That doesn't sound good.  No, so there's lots of medication treatment, so there can be ibuprofen.  with an anti-sickness.  which you can get from the pharmacy.  and you also to drink a sugary carbonated drink, something like Coke.  Okay. So the 3 of them is a good sort of cocktail to start them.  Then we can go up the treatment ladder.  You can get specific microlave medication, and that's just something to try between now and when we see you to do the to do the assessment.  Okay, some assessment where we could see you today at some point.  Okay.  But however, if you do take these medications and, you know, by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself, you can cancel it, you can give us a call and cancel it.  Okay, sounds good.  Yeah.  Okay, some sounds a good plan.  Any questions for me?  No, thank you very much.  You were very helpful.  All right, okay.  Any further problems between now and your appointment, please do let us know.  Okay, yeah, thank you very much.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  Sure, disconnect.
