Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Can you hear me okay?  I can hear you, but I can't really see you.  That's perfect.  Is that okay?  Am I meant to just a specific connection on this screen?  It's audio.  No, no, it's actually fine.  Now, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age?  Um, so my name is Dan Chaudhary.  7, 27. 27, AK.  how can I help you this afternoon, Dan?  Um, so I've just, um, been having some troubles.  Basically, I guess it's been a little while now, and I've just been feeling not so great, and it's all come from, like, it's like, basically, I think it's diarrhoea, and it's like just coming out, like, loads of it.  Like, I go to the toilet and it's just superb watery and it, yeah, it doesn't feel very solid.  It's just, it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's, uh, yeah, it's just, uh, not, not being very pleasant and like, I just, it just kind of hasn't, doesn't feel like it's getting better.  Wow, no, sorry to hear.  I think that there's a lot going on there.  Well, when did it all start your symptoms?  Um, so I think it was a few, when I think about it, so Monday, Tuesday, I, I saw, I think it was about 3, it's been about 3 days now.  Okay.  And it's in mainly diarrhoea.  So you mentioned Walcree stools.  How many times are you going a day, would you say?  Um, so I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake.  Right, well, you're losing a lot of flu there.  Yeah, so, I mean, I'm trying to drink a lot of water, but yeah, it's just quite a lot, and it's, yeah, I think I feel like it's just fluids coming out.  Okay. Have you seen you bloody your thoughts?  Um, So, I, no, I don't remember anything, like, no, I think it's just, nothing like that.  There's nothing like that.  Any any tummy pain, any any pain in your tummy? Yeah, I mean, I feel I feel a cramp. And then I know it's time to go, right?  So around every hour, I just feel something come up and then I have to go.  So, yeah, I mean, that's that's the kind of the first sign.  And where is this crampy pain?  Which part of your tummy?  It's kind of, as I want to, if I think about it, it's like, it's like at the bottom, I don't know if that makes sense.  Well, why don't we start with, is it, is it in the middle or is it to one particular side?  I think it feels pretty like in the middle to me, not on any side, left to right.  and this is pain come and go or is they constantly?  It comes and goes.  It comes again.  Okay.  And if I was asking to schedule one to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever had, how bad is this pain? Okay, so, like, um, So, what do you mean by, uh, pain?  So I think it's maybe... Is this pain that's making you double over?  Is 10, is it 10 out of 10, the worst pain you've ever had, or is it more of a kind of a mild pain, like a 3 out of 10?  I guess so, when I think about it, like, when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it, so I can still sit down and I can still, like,  cover it up and people don't really notice.  So I, I don't know what that means, but maybe is that like a 6 or a 7?  Okay, okay.  All right, good.  Apart from the pain and diarrhoea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Um, yeah, I definitely, I definitely feel kind of nauseous.  Um, like, I, and like, I have vomited, and when I, like, I think it's maybe something to do with, like, whenever I have, like, milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit, and actually, like, yeah, one time I just, like, had some milk, and I just completely vomited it.  I've been trying to avoid it, but yeah.  The bomb thing is not as pronounced as the diarrhoea, is that right?  Sorry, could you repeat that?  The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhoea, is that right?  Unknown, no, it's not.  Okay, okay, all right.  Any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures?  Um, so I, yeah, I think I am pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up.  I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that, but it's, yeah, I've, I've, sure, I'm, I'm not, like, not a normal temperature.  Okay, so you're feeling hot, okay?  In terms of your water works, are you passing urine okay?  Um, yeah, but I guess less frequently maybe.  Um, but yeah, it seems to be okay.  Okay, wait. Um, fine.  and you said mentioned 3 days ago was when it all kicked off.  Are you aware of any triggers?  I mean, have you, for example, gone out, had some takeaway food?  Have you been around anyone else and with diarrhoea, for example?  Um, so I know, so my, um, my brother has had, actually had something like this for, um, he has it as well for 5 days as well.  Um, and I, I, I'm not, yeah, I can't think of what, what the trigger is for me.  I mean, my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me, but yeah, that's why.  your brother now better?  Um, He, so he's been like this for 5 days.  I think he's getting better, but I'm not I'm not really sure.  he said he had he's had something for a little while as well.  Are you having anything to eat a drink?  I can see you're drinking your coffee, but are you keeping it down?  Are you keeping your fluids down?  Um, so it just feels like um, the fluids do go down, but it just feels like it's going straight through. just feels like it's going straight through.  Okay, always fine.  When was the last time we had anything solid to eat, which which you kept in?  Um, so, I had some,  I mean, I had some lunch today, um, but again, it just, it just came, come out pretty loose.  All right.  and Dan, moving forward, are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical history?  Um, so I, um, yeah, I think, I think otherwise, um, yeah, I mean, I, I'm an okay way, and, um, I, I, can't think of any related medical history.  Um, I mean, like my,  Yeah, no, I don't think so.  I'll take it you  any regular medications then.  So, I, um,  No, I mean, I've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately, but I haven't been,  I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that.  And do you have any allergies, any medications?  Um, so I don't have any allergies that I know of.  Okay.  What about any family history?  Do you have any family history of bowel problems?  Um, Bell, like, does, is the colon like something?  Yeah, yeah, so what I mean by Bell is a whole gut, really?  Anything from the...  So my, yeah, my, my dad actually has colon cancer at the moment.  Oh dear, I'm very sorry to hear that.  How is he?  So, from what I heard, he's kind of, so I don't speak to him that often.  So I don't, I don't know the exact details, and I don't exactly know the full things of, like, the steps of cancer and or black thing.  but he's sort of in his 3rd stage. I'm not sure what that means exactly.  Yeah, okay.  So, yeah, it's, it's, um, he's, yeah, you can, I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting me a lot and, um, that's, so it's quite, I guess it's, um, had it for a little while now.  I'm really fortunate. I'll make a note, though, because it's important to know these kind of details.  And socially, tell me more about your home situation.  Who's at home with you?  Dan?  Um, so, uh, not my brother, he doesn't live with me.  I live with my sister and my mum.  and how are things at home?  What sense do you mean that?  In general day-to-day live, are you managing okay?  Any particular?  I mean, uh, I think, uh, yeah, it's been, it's been tricky, um, going to work with all of this.  I dislike, um, taking time off work.  I feel like I just want to go when I can.  So I try and go, um,  I think at home.  uh, yeah, I just, I haven't really, um, I, I don't normally actually, um, eat with my family.  I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing, so I don't think it's affected them and I haven't really been  I haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mom about it.  Yeah, I'd just rather deal with these things.  So...  Well, you mentioned that.  Well, you mentioned work.  Where is it you do for work?  Um, so I work at a, I work at, um, an office, um, in Central London, um, it's, uh, so I work in government.  government, okay, so, okay, right.  There's a couple of last final couple of questions there.  smoking and alcohol.  do you do either?  Do you smoke or do you drink Russian way of alcohol?  Um, so I smoke, um, uh, for, like, socially, but not, like, regularly, um, so normally, if it's a Friday or something like that, I might, I might have a cigarette or something like that.  But, um... Sorry? And alcohol?  So, alcohol, um, you know, I might have a beer during the weekdays, maybe, not many, maybe, um, but honestly, on Fridays, I have more alcohol.  Um, but yeah, I buy a lot more units, um, uh, on it, I suppose, um, not every week, but maybe, uh, once or twice a month, but yeah, I'll go out with my friends and we'll drink a lot so that that's, um, yeah.  I mean, that's very helpful to know.  So, um, Dan, just as a conclusion.  Just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis.  a bit of a basically an infection of your tummy.  There's nothing to worry about.  I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days, just like it did for your brother.  Make sure you drink plenty of fluids, okay?  You can just drink like normal water.  I just feel like every time I drink, it's just coming out.  Their fluid is probably best.  But I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins.  So you can get things like diarolite, which is a fluid replacement we can get from the pharmacy.  It's probably worth recommending that.  Do I need like a prescription for that?  No, you can just get that over the counter.  Okay. You can try just, you know, regular piracy to more if you are being feverish.  But if your symptoms aren't setting down in the next couple of days, so 48 hours, I want you to give me a call back because, you know, if you are getting dehydrated, then we need to do further investigations, okay?  But I think let's let's see how you are the next one to 2 days.  and we'll catch up soon, okay?  Okay, so you're saying that I should, I could, I'll try and buy this direct, like,  What should I do in terms of food and that kind of thing?  Should I just go just fluids?  Food is all the, absolutely, it's a clear blue, you can use soft diet, things like soup, mash, and then gradually build up as much as your body can tolerate, but really let's try and to keep us off well hydrated first, okay?  Okay, is it okay for me to carry on having like paracetamol and things like that?  Absolutely. If you are having, if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think paracetamol is very sensible.  Okay.  Okay, try and avoid alcohol if you can.  Uh, okay, I'll try.  Yeah, okay.  All right, then.  Okay.  Thank you for your help  All right.  Thank you very much.  Thanks. Thanks.  Thank me up.  Bye bye now.
