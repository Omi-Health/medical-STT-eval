Hello?  Can you hear me, okay?  Yeah, I hear you. Right, excellent.  I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please?  Sure.  I'm Amanda Jackson, and I'm 19 years old.  19 years old.  Okay, Amanda, and how can I help you this afternoon?  Um, so it's been going on for a few days now.  It's not happened before, and I'm a bit worried.  It hurts when I kind of pee.  and yeah, it's like, I'm going to the toilet a lot more.  and it's really, like, I can't, like, go to uni properly.  I'm just constantly looking for the toilet.  and it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in the bottom of my tummy as well.  Right, okay.  there's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you.  So you mentioned you've been gaming for the last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass.  Urine.  You say you're into the toilet more often as well.  Is that right?  Uh, yeah, it's been going on for a little bit longer than 3 days, I think, actually.  Maybe just under a week.  Oh, in the week, sorry.  Sorry, no, I didn't explain it properly before.  Yeah, no, it's been going on for about just under a week.  And yeah, I do notice sort of burning, stinging when I go to the toilet.  Yeah.  Have you any anything new urine, for example, any blood or discolouration of urine?  Um, I think, well, today I noticed, um, it was like a bit pink.  the urine.  Yeah.  I think just today.  Any kind of frank blood?  I mean, we've red blood at all, you new urine?  I think it was picked in, probably.  I don't know, it was pink, so.  Okay, fine.  we'll definitely explore that in a little bit.  more detail later on.  You ought to mention some tummy pain as well.  Can you come a bit more about that pain?  Yeah, it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy.  Mainly when I go to the loo.  I think that's when it's worse.  Okay. Can you describe it in crampy pain?  is it more of a burning pain?  Um, I wouldn't describe it as crampy.  I don't think it's like a period pain.  It's a bit different.  It's hard to say, an achy pain.  suppose.  Does a pain move anywhere else?  Is it moved towards your back?  towards your sides.  No, no.  Okay, all right.  Any other symptoms at all?  probably nausea, vomiting.  No, no, is your vomiting?  Any temperatures or fevers?  Um no, no, not that I've noticed.  Okay, all right. and how are your bells at the moment?  I was making you okay?  Uh, I I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway.  So I don't think it's any different from what it usually is.  We wouldn't say you have probably what kind of problems you normally have.  Um, I think I have um IBS.  Um, so I just kind of passed my battles like quite quite a lot.  Um, and sometimes it's quite, it's quite variable.  Like sometimes it's a bit softer.  Sometimes it's a bit, sorry, this is a bit disgusting, but like sometimes it's a bit harder and it's kind of hard to predict.  Okay, all right.  But there's no unique kitchens.  No, no, no new symptoms in your bells.  No, no, not. All right.  And Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions, as you can imagine.  Can I ask, are you currently, are you currently sexually active?  Uh, yeah, I have a long-term boyfriend.  Okay. and have you noticed any other discharge from down below?  So, from the front passage.  No, I don't think so.  nothing unusual.  Have you, do you use any form of contraception?  Uh, yeah.  I'm on the pill.  What kind of pillows is it combined pill or the mini pill?  Combined pill?  Okay.  Fine.  When was the last time you had unprotected sex?  If you don't want me asking.  Uh, I mean, I mean, unprotected, is there, like, no condoms or anything?  Yeah, exactly.  I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend.  just like, I don't know.  We've just kind of agreed.  So I guess a week ago, two weeks ago.  All right.  What I'm trying to guess at is whether there's any chance you could be pregnant at all?  I know you're on the pill, but nonetheless, we do have to ask.  When was your last, when was your last period?  Um, 2 weeks ago?  Two weeks ago.  Okay, all right.  Just something far to bear in mind, if your symptoms don't get any better, okay?  Fine.  In terms of your general health, otherwise at the moment, are you eating and drinking okay?  Uh, yeah, yeah, eating drinking, okay.  Um, I did have one kind of concern.  I don't know.  So, I smoked, this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the 1st time, like a week and a half ago, and I just wonder whether it's related at all.  Probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you.  Well, thanks for sharing with me.  So I don't think it is related to your symptoms.  I think it's probably just pure coincidence.  But, you know, I do strongly advise you to, you know, make it a regular habit if you can, just for your general health moving forwards.  Okay?  I'm fine.  Moving on, in terms of your health, otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions, apart from IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of?  Okay, great.  And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis, apart from the combined pill?  Apart from the pill, I take something for the IBS as well.  It begins with an M.  It's pretty hard to pronounce, like mebbe or something.  Maybe.  Yeah, yeah, that's it, yeah, that's right.  Okay, in a level of cramps, the crampy pain.  and do you have any allergies to any medications?  Um, yeah, I think there was an antibiotic um called Klindus Klindomycin.  missing. that I took like half years ago, something, and yeah, that that didn't go too well. with me.  I'll make an issue of that.  In terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? Nope. Nope, don't you anything else?  Good.  And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation.  Who's at home with you?  Um, so I am living in halls at the moment, uh, uni.  So I'm just living with a flatmate, I suppose, but my family live kind of outside of London, not too far away.  So yeah, my family are fine and I see them now and then.  Yeah, things I think are okay generally.  Great, and what are you selling at university?  I'm studying English?  English?  Okay, good.  how are you enjoying your course?  Yeah, yeah.  It's going well.  thanks.  Just kind of started a few months ago, a few months ago.  I really enjoy it.  Yeah, yeah.  Good.  In terms of smoking and alcohol, do you do participate either?  As I admitted before, I tried weed the 1st time, but I don't smoke, I drink occasionally kind of socially with friends.  Okay, what made you have your 1st joint last week?  Was it? I was just a party.  There were other people doing it.  I kind of was a little bit tipsy, so probably wasn't thinking quite straight.  But yeah, I completely agree.  It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis.  Sure, as long as your doctor tell me to cook off Tuesday, I'll strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid as your friend.  Great.  Fine.  So, at this age, I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think, you know, I'm reassured by the fact, I think it's probably just a simple, what we say, UTI or a socitis bladder infection.  you know, you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about, so things like fevers and back pain would be more worrying for me to hear.  So some we can treat quite readily with antibiotics.  So we've got choices to antibiotics, something called trimethaprin, or nitroprin toin, which is a three-day course.  Normally they're usually quite effective for your symptoms.  It's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well, if you can, so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there.  Start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids.  If you are having some pain, simple paracetamol, would probably be advisable.  We'll see what the urine sample shows.  And if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones.  But if things are still not getting better next week, come back and see me, and we can have another look again.  Okay, okay.  Great.  With the urine sample, how do I go about doing that?  Well, good question.  So I will give you, I will organise for you to come in and drop off a sample of one of our practises, which we can test there and then, with a urine dip, then send off the lab, and we can always get back in touch with you with the results.  Okay perfect.  Okay.  Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call, okay?  Either that train, obviously.  Great, okay, yeah, I'll chat.  Okay.  Have a good day.  Okay, thank you.  Thank you.  Have a good night.  Bye-bye.
