Hello?  Good morning, Kim.  How can I help you this morning?  Um, so I'm, some, some pain in my tummy, like the lower part of my tummy.  and I'm just being quite hot and sweaty.  Right, I'm sorry to hear that.  When did your symptoms all start?  Okay.  And whereabouts in a tummy is a pain, exactly?  Uh, like, below my belly button?  so I quite sore when I press on it.  Okay.  Did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual?  It hasn't been, it's more gradual and it's just, it's getting a bit worse now.  Okay, okay.  and can you describe the pain to me?  Uh, it's kind of like a, I guess a burning pain?  and it's just right there in that spot, like, that's mostly where I'm feeling it.  It hasn't spread anything else.  Justin, just below your belly button you weren't mentioned.  Okay.  and is the pain constant or does it come and go?  Very constant.  It's like getting worse.  um, it's not like, I can still move and walk around.  I mean, I'm still kind of functioning.  It's just, uh, I'm aware of it all time.  Okay. and with the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?  So, for example, let's focus first on your bowels.  Are your bowels working okay?  Yeah, I had a bit of constipation, but that's better. No, that was like, since last week.  Okay, so you've got no other symptoms like diarrhoea or loose stools?  No. My bowel movements are normal now.  Okay.  and what about your waterworks?  Are you passing urine okay?  Yeah, that's fine.  I did notice that I was a little, the urine was a little pink in colour, but I haven't, like, it hasn't really been burning specifically or hurting when I pee, and, uh, and I did notice I was going to the, I was peeing more regularly, but I have been drinking lots of fluids, so I wasn't sure, um, I wasn't sure, um, like, wasn't, you know, if that was related to the pain.  When you mentioned paint urine,  was there any blood at all in your urine or was it difficult to say?  I can't say, I mean, maybe.  Okay. All right, but otherwise it doesn't hurt or sting when you pass urine.  I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that.  just that I'm peeing more than off more regularly.  Okay.  and moving up towards other symptoms.  Have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all?  Just a little nauseous.  Um, but not vomiting.  No vomiting.  Any temperatures or fevers?  I haven't really, I felt a bit hot and sweaty, but I haven't really measured it, so I can't really say it.  Okay. um, uh, and came to have to ask, um, uh, you know, all, all female patients.  There's questions about your cycles, if you don't mind me asking.  Are you currently, um, are you currently sexually active?  Yeah, I've had the same partner.  I am, we were last actually acted about four days ago.  My last STD screen was normal, which was about 6 months ago.  Okay, so you've had no other partners since then?  Okay.  and do you use any contraception at all?  Um, on the implant on, I had the implant on inserted about a year ago.  implement, okay.  fine.  Are you still having periods?  Yes.  When was your last period?  Uh, my last period was about 3 weeks ago.  I mean, 2 weeks ago?  Two weeks ago.  Okay.  So is there any chance you could be pregnant?  I know you've got an implement in, is there any chance you could pretend to be pregnant?  It's something for us to think about, but  We don't use any other barrier methods, so we just use the  I just have the implant on in the same partner.  Theoretically, the implanon hasn't been working, then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect.  Okay, well, something for us to think about, maybe worth doing pregnancy tests later on just to confirm that.  Okay, and so just to summarise, so far, if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple of days is Tommy Payne has really affected you, mainly lower down towards your belly button.  It's quite burning, you said, it's getting worse.  Um, you know, some pink urine, um, but no burning or stinging pain when you posture and your bowels are waking okay.  You felt living nauseous and feeling hot and sweaty.  Have I got that all right?  Yeah, sounds very accurate.  Is there anything else, perhaps, that you feel like you should share with me at this stage, which you think might be important?  I don't think so.  I think you've covered everything.  bothering me.  Yeah, okay.  Tell me a bit more about your medical history otherwise.  Are you normally fitting well?  Yeah, well, I haven't had any surgical, I don't have any surgical history.  I don't have any previous.  I haven't had any operations before or and I'm not on any other medication.  I just had the implement.  Okay.  Yeah, anything like this before in the past, any similar symptoms?  I've never had  I've never had these symptoms before.  No, okay.  Um, point.  Any other family history, I should be aware of anything relevant to family related to bowels, maybe related to guiding history.  No, not that I'm aware of.  Okay, all right.  And socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation.  Who's at home with you?  Uh, I live in a share house and with 2 other 2 other roommates.  Okay, um, and are you currently working?  Yeah, I currently, I'm currently with, what would you do for work?  I am an accountant.  Okay.  Um... Great, okay.  Do you smoke at all, Kim?  No. No.  and you drink much in the way of alcohol.  Uh, socially I drink, but uh, I don't think more, more than normal.  I understand.  Okay.  Just before I go to examination, just want to go through just some few screening questions, that's okay, yes or no.  We've covered the majority of them already, but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else.  How's your, how's your chest?  How's your breathing?  I don't feel short of breath or I'm not having any problems or I don't have a cough or anything that's wrong.  Okay, any funny heartbeats or rhythms, palpitations?  Not that, no.  Okay.  Any headaches, any problems with your vision?  No, okay.  All right.  Fine.  Okay.  So really just, um, moving on, um, so based, based on your story, really, uh, Kim, it's a, it's a difficult one.  It's, it's, um, we know you've got some premie pain.  exactly know what's causing it.  There could be a few different things that could be causing your pain.  Could just be a, you know, could just be a urine infection, for example, could this be something related to your gut?  Um, could this be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy related cause?  And so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out what's going on here.  which I can organise for you today.  Okay. And the base on those tests, we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed.  But certainly, if it's been going on for the last couple of days, um, you know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for maybe a urinefection.  and so with some...  Can we do that instead of me going for tests and then seeing how that goes?  Yeah, absolutely.  So, I think it's certainly worth, you know, covering you with some antibiotics today.  But I still want you to bear in mind, you know, having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here.  And I want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days' time, if you have Simpsons, are not getting you better, or indeed, they're getting worse.  So, things to look out for would be, you know, worse than tummy pain, um, if you're feeling really hot as sweaty, the temperature's not coming down.  Um, vomiting, et cetera.  Does that make sense?  Yeah, I think I'm happy with that plan.  Okay.  You can try just regular painkillers, paracetamol will be advisable.  Make sure you drink plenty of fluids.  You can try some cranberry juice as well, which can sometimes help with your urine symptoms.  take the antibiotics.  and give me a call, you know, if you are worried about anything else.  Sure, that sounds great.  Thank you very much.  Should I just collect the script at my pharmacy?  Yep, I'll send it straight to your pharmacy.  Start your antibodies today, something called trimethaprin.  We'll take 2 tablets, one tablet twice a day for 3 days.  Okay, let's hear you get on.  Okay, thank you very much.  Great, all the best.  Bye. Bye.
