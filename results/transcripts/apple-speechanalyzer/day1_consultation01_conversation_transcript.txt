I need to stay close to the toilet and yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities.  Sorry to hear that.  And when you say diarrhoea, what do you mean by diarrhoea?  Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often or are your stools more loose?  Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stall going to the toilet quite often and like some pain in my like lower stomach?  And how many times a day are you going, let's say, in the last couple of days?  Probably like six, seven times a day?  six, seven times a day.  and you may have mentioned it's mainly water tree.  Have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools?  No, no blood, yeah, just watery and loose stall.  Okay.  And you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well.  Yep. Whereabouts is a pain?  Is that good?  in my lower abdomen.  So, like, yeah, just to one side.  one side, what side is that?  on the left side?  left side.  Okay.  and can you describe the pain to me?  Yeah, it films like a cramp?  like a muscular cramp and yeah, I feel a bit weak and shaky.  Okay.  And there's a pain?  is it there all the time or does it come and go?  It comes and goes.  We go,  does a pain move anywhere else?  where's your back?  Um, no, just mainly my stomach.  Okay.  fine.  And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well.  What do you mean by shaky?  you mean you've been having, have you been feeling feverish, for example?  Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like, uh, yeah, I just meant for a week.  I haven't had a fever at the moment, but I did notice a temperature when the symptoms started.  So, yeah, around about 3 or 4 days ago.  Can you measure your temperature then?  Yeah, I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt just a bit hot.  Okay, okay.  Any other symptoms like sweating or light?  and any vomiting at all.  Yeah, so I vomited at the start of the symptoms, but now I've stopped vomiting.  Stop vomiting.  Okay.  and was you vomit?  I know it's not nice to talk about, but was it just normal food colour?  Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit.  and there was no blood in your vomit.  that right?  No, no, okay.  And any other symptoms at all?  So you mentioned the tummy pain, you mentioned the vomiting.  anything else that comes to mind?  I had a loss of appetite.  I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids. Okay, so you're drinking fluids.  What kind of foods have you managed to eat anything?  Um, just soups?  and yeah, light foods, like smoothies and yeah, liquid foods mainly.  Um, and so, uh, they started three days ago, The Simpsons.  Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms to kick on?  So, for example, things like takeaway foods or eating out or beating around other people who would sing the symptoms.  Yeah, so I had takeaway about 4 days ago.  Um, uh, but other than that, I've, yeah, I've been, uh, eating normally, I think, unusual, yeah.  Do you remember where you ate?  Um, yeah, I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends.  Okay.  Anyone else on well with similar Timton?  Um, so no one else in the family side, wife and 2 kids and one um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhoea.  no one with the same symptoms.  fine.  Right.  And in terms of your overall health, are you normally fitting well? Yeah, I mean, other than asthma, using inhaler, everything else is fine.  Okay.  and did you asthma well controlled?  Yeah, that's fine.  just, yeah, use an inhaler, and that's under control.  And you don't have any other tummy problem, bowel problems I should be aware of.  No, okay.  Apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications?  No, no other medications.  Okay, fine.  And in terms of just your day-to-day life, you said it's been affecting your life.  In what way has it been affecting your life?  Sorry, I need to stay close to the toilet because I go quite frequently during the these past three days.  Yeah, other than that, it's the main concern.  And are you currently working at the moment?  Yeah, I work.  people work.  I'm an accountant.  Okay.  Have you been going to work the last three days or have you been at home?  Yeah, I've been going to work.  That must be difficult for you then.  Yeah, it's been quite difficult.  And you say you mentioned you live with a wife and 2 children, is that right?  Yes.  All right.  Just a couple of other questions we need to ask.  Do you smoke at all?  No, I don't smoke.  And you drink much in the way of alcohol?  No, I don't drink alcohol, no.  Okay.  So, um, uh, normally at this stage I like to um, examine you if that's okay.  But having listened to your stories, I think, just recap, for the last 3 days, you've been having loose dual diarrhoea, a bit of tummy pain, mainly on the left-hand side, and vomiting and theme, generally quite weak and lethargic.  You mentioned you're having this Chinese takeaway as well 3 days ago.  And I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems.  Okay. It seems like you may have something called gastroenteritis, which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your tummy.  mainly caused by viruses, but it can be a possibility of bacteria causing your symptoms.  At this stage, what we'd recommend is just what we say, conservative management.  So I don't think you need anything like antibiologics is really just making sure you're wealth hydrated.  So drinking fluids.  There are things like dialect you can get from the pharmacy, which it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. And if you are having vomiting in diary, I would say recommend in a first, you know, first couple of days.  If you are feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, a few tablets up to 4 times a day for the 1st few days can also help, I'll certainly advise you to take some time at work.  Actually, I know you're quite keen to work.  I would say next 2 to 3 days, as a question clears from your system, just take some time more from rest.  You know, if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in 3 to 4 days, I'd like to come back and see you again.  because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing symptoms. and we may need to do further tests, like taking a sample of your stool, so we can test that, et cetera, et cetera.  Yeah, sure, yeah.  How does that sound?  That sounds great, yeah.  Yeah.  you have any questions for me?  Um, no, no further questions.  Okay.  Is the treatment plan clear?  Yeah, yeah, that's that's very clear.  Thank you.  Great.  I wish you all the best.  Okay, thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.
