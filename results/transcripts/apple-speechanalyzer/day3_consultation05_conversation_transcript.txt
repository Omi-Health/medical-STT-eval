So you've mentioned that you're feeling dizzy, is it?  You know, I mean, yes.  Yeah, I'm feeling I'm yeah, I just feeling very sick.  That's probably because I'm feeling dizzy.

So when did it all start?  started probably about 2 hours ago, maybe, but I, I, um, I had it a similar sort of thing about a month ago.  um, but I didn't really think anything of it because it's settled quite quickly.  this has been going for a bit more now.  Okay, so you said, you mentioned it started a few hours ago.  So what did it start?  were you doing?  Um, I was actually making my husband some breakfast.  Um, and I, yeah, I just suddenly felt very fuzzy and dizzy and a bit shaky. y  Okay.  So, you mentioned it.  like the room spinning around?  Yeah.  Okay.  And is how long does it last for?

Um, you mentioned that you have some year buzzing kind of thing.  Any kind of year pain or year discharge, anything like that?  No, nothing.  Okay, do you have a temperature at all?  don't think so.  Okay.  Right.  You also mentioned that you can walk, but you're not walking straight.  Why is that?  Is it because?  I think just because the room feels like it's moving a bit.  That's why you feel like you're a bit unsteady, yeah?  My my legs and arms and everything are working fine.  I don't feel like I'm stable.  the room is spinning.  So there's no weakness of your arms and legs.  Okay.  No, okay.  Right.  Um, so you mentioned you had something like this a month ago.  So how, how long did that episode last for?  Probably only about five, 10 minutes.  Okay, right.  And do you have any problems hearing at the moment?  Like, is it muffled or something?  It's just a bit of a buzzy noise in my ears, but otherwise I can hear everything.  Right to you.  Okay.  So, have you been physically sick?  No, but I am feeling very sick.  nausea.  Okay.  Right here.  And I don't have much information of your past medical history, so is there any medical conditions you'd like to tell me surgical medical conditions?  Um, I've had premature ovarium failure, um, and I've taken HRT.  Okay.  charity and premature orbearing.  Okay, and any other medications at all?  No.  Okay, do you have any allergies at all?  No. Okay.  Right.  Okay, so, walking to you today, um, in the most, the most common, um, you know, diagnosis we would feel we are suffering from at the moment is something called labyrinthitis, yeah?  Okay, that's when your middle year, there is some, um, some inflammation going on there and there is some imbalances in the crystals there in your middle year.  Okay?  So, what the most important treatment is actually giving you some kind of middle yesterday data, so that you won't feel as if you're going around in a boat.  kind of feeling.  Okay?  So that's what we need to start, because to actually make you able to function a bit more.  We'll start you on certain medications.  I would still like you to be seen by one of our doctors to take a look inside your ears to just make sure.  So this is like just symptomatic relief, like if you have a fever, we just give paracetamol.  So just to, you know, make you able to come and see one of the doctors and things like that.  While you're with the doctors, we'd like to do your blood pressure, just examine your, you know, you know, how you're walking and everything is.  Okay.  While we're waiting, while you're waiting on seeing the doctor, if you develop any weakness of your legs or arms, or, you know, a sudden headache, any of those symptoms, or you start being violently sick with it, then you know, you would need to take yourself to A&E.  Okay.  But if not, wait for the appointment for the doctor to examine you, and we'll take it from there.  So I'll send a prescription across to your pharmacy.  It looks like it's the Lloyd pharmacy on our system.  Is that correct?  Yeah.  So we'll send you across that prescription.  It's called Camel.  Yep, it's one tablet 3 times a day, so I'll give you for about 10 days' worth.  In the interim, obviously, in the next few days, you'll get to see one of our doctors and we'll have to just take it from there.  Okay, thank you so much.  Only questions at all.  Um, can you take, do you need to take those tablets with food or can you just take them anytime?  It doesn't really matter.  You can take it because sometimes, you know, you get the symptoms as soon as you wake up, so probably you'll feel a bit sick to eat anything, so you might as well just take the tablets.  Okay, that's great.  Thank you so much.  that's so helpful  Just make sure you call support to book that appointment.  Okay.  I will.  Thank you very much.  Bye now.  Bye.
