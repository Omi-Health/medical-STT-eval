If you can tell me a bit more about it, please.  Yes, uh, over the past few days, I had, uh, I've noticed my skin is sore and red. Okay.  So where is it, sore and red?  Um, it's all over my chest, my hands and arms.  Especially inside of the elbows, and... On the inside of the elbows, yeah?  Which is the worst area.  All right, the worst area.  Is it very itchy?  It's very itchy and dry, all over my body.  Itchy and dry.  Okay.  Have you had something like this in the past?  Yes, yes, I have an eczema in Nepal.  Okay, do you think this is similar to your usual eczema?  Is it worse?  I think it's, yeah, it's going worse like this past few days.  Yeah, but it could be like something similar.  So, on your skin, is there any, you know, any of the patches, sore areas mentioned, it's quite sore.  Is it weeping?  Is it like watery liquid coming from that area?  Weeping?  No. Nothing that's noticed.  Okay.  Right.  But some of the areas are cracked.  Yeah, so you have cracks over there, okay?  and is there any scratch marks on your, on any of the, you know, areas, any scratch marks?  I mean, it's very itchy to scratch myself.  No.  Okay.  Is there any thickened skin?  Like, you know, where it, the skin's very, um, thick and darkened areas.  No, no, I don't think, I don't think so.  Okay.  right here.  So, you've mentioned you've got a history of eczema.  So what do you do about it?  How do you keep it under control?  Yeah, usually I use a cream called deprobate.  In the shower, I use something called thermal.  Dermal, all right.  And have you been using them recently or not?  Yes, yes, I use them.  use them every day?  Yes, there's no change in that.  didn't change any  Okay.  Have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema?  Um, a, a,  I'm not sure.  Yes, yes, I yes.  um, but it's, it's not helping.  Yeah, also, you're still using the steroids.  Yeah, I tried.  Which one are you using the steroids?  What's the name?  I'm not sure. It's... Is it your? It's not there.  Okay, so is it like the L with the counter once?  Sorry? Over the counter, hydrocortisone.  Does that ring up?  Yep.  So you're using the hydrocortisone, yeah?  Are you using any antihistamines at all?  Uh...  No, no antihistamines.  Okay.  Right.  Fine.  Otherwise, other than those rush, you're feeling well in yourself.  no temperature, no joint paints.  Yeah?  No. But I realise I've tried those on teeth, I mean, it didn't work.  You've tried the antihistamines and didn't work.  Okay, which one did you try?  The one over the counter?  Okay, so like Cetrus in, yeah?  Yeah, okay, that's fine.  Right.  Okay, so from what you're describing, it looks like, you know, it is quite widespread your eczema.  Yeah, because you're having it all over your chest and her hands and things like that.  Um, so do you have any allergies to any medication at all?  No, no allergy.  No allergies.  Okay.  and you don't, other than eczema, you don't have any other medical condition.  I have asthma.  And in my family, there is a hypotheoidism and migraine.  My mother, as migraine.  Mother has migraine, and what was the other one I didn't understand?  I, I, who has hypothyroidism?  Okay, so she has hypothyroidism.  Okay, that's fine.  Right, you.  You mentioned you have asthma.  So what medications are you using for asthma?  Um,  Uh, you know, probably nader.  The blue inhaler, so you don't, you don't use it every day.  So you just use it on and off, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Blue inhalers, but your breathing's all okay.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, it's only when I have a player.  Yeah.  So what we need to do is, obviously, you've got extent, as I've mentioned, so extensive eczema.  What we'll do is, you need a couple of things because to keep you a bit comfortable, you'll, you would probably need some antihistamines, which I'm going to prescribe.  Also, hydrocortisone is a baby steroids that you use for young children.  You might probably need a bit more stronger one like better weight or something like that.  Okay?  So we'll try that 1st.  So, I'm going to get, it's called the anti-estimate, it's called fax penedine, and then we'll try with some betna weight first. So, it's like very small amount, like it's like one fingertip.  Yep, this much is is enough to cover your palms.  and you get back of your hands, yeah?  So it's very small amount, so that if you can imagine, you can cover with a very small amount, the whole body.  Yeah, so use that.  You have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks.  Okay?  If there's no improvement, you need to get back to us or if you have any kind of adverse reaction, like an allergic reaction, which is unlikely, but if it still happens, you need to get in touch with us, okay?  Okay thank you very much.  So what we're going to do is, we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy, it looks like boots on the systems.  Is that correct?  Yeah.  Yes. Yes, so I'll send it across to Boots, and I won't be there for collecting.  If things are getting worse in the next 2 weeks, call us beforehand, otherwise wait for 2 weeks, take the medication and the cream.  You still need to continue on your emollions, like the thermal soap and as well as the deprivation.  Yeah.  So you still need to use those in the interim.  Any questions at all?  No, no question.  You take care then.  Bye-bye now.  Bye, bye.
