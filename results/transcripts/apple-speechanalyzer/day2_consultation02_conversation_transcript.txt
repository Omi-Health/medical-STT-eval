Hi there, good morning.  Hello, good morning.  Um, I'm Dr. Dean Mizza from GPH.  nice to see you  Nice to see you.  Okay, before we start your appointment,  Could you please tell me your 1st name and your date of birth?  Yes.  My name is John Smith, and I was born on the 5th of April, uh 19.  Okay, that's great.  Thank you for that.  Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely?  Yes, absolutely.  Okay, great.  Okay, so, um, tell me a bit about what's been happening.  You mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow.  Yeah, I just noticed this like about a week ago or something.  I have like a weird swelling on my elbow.  I noticed that when I was in the shower, uh, it's not painful at all, uh, I, I feel fine, but it's just, it's just a bit, a bit weird to see that.  Um, it's, it's slightly warm.  Um, and I, I kind of feel like this, it's a bit fluid inside our, uh, so, I, I like to know what's going on.  and so did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow?  Um, it's the left hand table.  leftover.  Okay.  and have you banged that elbow?  Did you have any kind of injury?  No, not really.  Not that I know of.  I haven't noticed anything.  I can actually, like, move it normally.  um, it's just, I can, I can just see that it feels a bit strange.  Sure, okay.  And in terms of your job, do you do anything physical?  Not really, no, I just, you know, sit at the desk.  Okay.  and has this happened before?  No, no, I haven't noticed that before.  I don't have any, like, history of I've seen this.  I don't remember.  So okay.  And can I, um, can I just stop a check?  Has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that?  Um, oh, well, I I do, well, I think, I think I have something like Ostra apprises.  It sometimes kind of hurts my joints.  But in my family, I'm not sure.  Okay.  Sure. So, you know, you said, you think you've got a ostral arthritis? Has anyone ever told you that?  Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got oster arthritis?  Um, yes, yes, a few years ago.  Okay.  Was that a GP or a specialist or was it a physiotherapy?  A GP and GP?  Okay.  right.  Um, can I just, sorry, can I just double check how old you are, please?  I'm 53?  53.  Okay, fantastic.  All right.  And do you have any other illnesses at all?  Um,  Well, not, you know, um, for you.  I'm allergic to peanuts.  Right, okay. That's pretty much, I had to say, but my medical.  Are you allergic to any medication?  No. Not that I know of.  Sure.  And um, do you, um, are you on any medication or regular basis?  No, okay.  and you normally fit in well, mobile activity.  I do, I do, do some sports.  I run regularly, like, two, three times a week.  Um, yeah, no, um, I think I'm healthy.  Okay, good. Glad to hear that. Well done.  good that you're doing that on a regular basis.  Okay.  Um, can I, is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now?  Yes, sure.  Okay, compare with me 12nd.  Right, okay.  And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit, that a bit higher so I can just see the underside?  Okay, fantastic.  All right.  And then just bring it round to this side.  essentially, I can see the other side.  Okay, fantastic.  All right.  and if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers,  Is it hot compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin?  It's a bit warm yes.  It's a bit warmer.  Okay.  Um, and um, is it very tender when you're pressing on that now?  if you give it a press?  Is it hurt you at all?  On the on the tip of the elbow, it's okay, just like next to it, like where the swelling is, it's a bit,  Yeah, it fills a bit through it.  Okay.  All right.  Um, well, um, I noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the other,  Do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body?  No, no, yeah, yes.  Do you suffer from eczema at all?  No.  No, all right.  Okay, so um,  What I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem, okay, is I think it would be worthwhile.  this seems like what we call the busitis.  okay?  So that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacks around the joint.  What I think we should do is, I think we should be on some anti-inflammatory medication, in the 1st instance.  and as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done.  to check for other types of causes of joint swelling.  Okay?  So, um, what we're going to do is, we're going to arrange some, um, blood test forms to be sent out to your house, and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done.  and that will involve you having some test done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies,  So we'll do a full screen, and also check things like gout as well.  Okay?  Okay.  The timeframe for that will be, um, the results will come back to us after about five, six days, um, get from now.  We take time for the forms to come out to you.  And if you get the form of tests on the straightaway,  By the time that we're expecting a result back, you know, one or 2 days after that, we're looking at maybe 6 days.  And what I would suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you, one of our clinics, where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood tests, and we can, um, get a gauge as to, uh, what's going on.  Now, in terms of your joint right now, it doesn't look like, to me, that's something called, excuse me, septic arthritis.  So we are worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint.  and your joint doesn't look like that.  However, if the elbow was to become very red, very painful, and the redness was to spread or become, you know, more intense, then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible, because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment.  okay?  Do you think it's something dangerous, like something, like, can equidate from that, or is it?  No, I don't think this is anything dangerous.  Don't need to worry.  Okay.  What I'm doing is  outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop.  Okay?  So if we go to Wilson, this is not the case right now.  Right now, it looks quite straightforward.  It's nothing sinister or life-threatening.  What I'm doing is  I'm just saying, in case things worsen, these are the things that we'll be looking out for, and this is what we have to do.  but you don't have that now, thankfully.  and I don't think you're going to have it.  But I'm just saying the what if scenario.  Is that okay?  Yeah, that sounds good.  Thank you.  All right.  you have any questions that you wanted to ask me?  Well, just, yeah, I just wanted to know about this.  Yeah, it feels a bit better now to know that.  Yeah, no, that's it.  Thank you.  Okay, so I would take ibuprofen regularly.  Okay, you can get that over the counter, that's 400 milligrams, 2 times a day, and you should take that after food, not on an empty stomach.  If you get any heartburn, stop taking it, okay?  Sure.  All right.  So what I want to do is, I'll get the formal sent out to you.  and we are going to arrange a follow-up appointment, maybe within a, um, actually, you know, the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face-to-face.  If it's more conveniently to do it over the phone,  We can do that over the phone over video.  You can do that as well.  That's your call.  But you contact us after you've had the blood test done, or we can review things then, okay?  Okay, yeah, that sounds good.  I'll do that.  and if I see that it's getting worse,  I'll probably ask for a physical appointment, but sure, sure, that's a good idea.  All right then.  Okay, take care then.  So just leave that with me.  those bits and pieces out and we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll review you after the test.  things go well.  All right.  All right, let's take in.  all the best.  Bye bye.  Bye.
