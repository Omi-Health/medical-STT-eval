Alex?  Oh, hello?  Can you hear me?  Okay, great.  How can I help you this morning, sir?  Hi, so I've been feeling, I've been feeling kind of under the weather for the past 4 days.  It started with a sore throat and runny nose and it's sort of, um, it's sort of going into a cough now.  Um, the sore throat is kind of going away, but um, I'm starting to cough.  Mm-hmm. Okay. So, I was to hear that kind of, uh, bad and tired.  Hmm. Okay, I'm sorry to hear.  like there's a lot going on there.  So let's start with your sore throat first.  Tell me a bit more about that if you can.  Um, so, I, I, you know, I think I, it all started with the, as a colleague of mine, she, she just kept sneezing next to me all the time.  I think her kids are catching something from the, uh, from their kindergarten or something, and, uh, you know, the, it, it started as normal sore throat, and, you know, it was quite painful for a couple days, but then it was fast.  Okay, okay.  and did you have any difficulty or pain on swallowing?  Um, yeah, yeah, it was, uh, it was quite painful to swallow.  Did you manage to have a look in the back of your throat in the mirror?  No, not really.  No, okay, you didn't you didn't notice any abnormal white sports redness at the back of your throat?  Um,  No, I didn't think about, uh, looking.  That's okay.  that's okay.  And you mentioned a ruddy nose.  Again, what kind of discharge is coming out?  Is it clear or is it a bit more coloured?  Yeah, yeah, it's, yeah, it's clear, but sort of, um, sort of getting my nose stuffed all the time.  It's very hard to get it free.  Okay, so you feel quite congested to you?  Yeah, quite congested.  Okay fine.  You also mentioned a cough as well.  Can you come more about that?  Um, yeah, that started recently, like just, um, maybe yesterday and, um, it's dry for now.  it's not very painful but it's sort of there all the time.  Okay.  and is it worth any particular time of the day?  Sorry?  Is it worth at any particular time of the day, for example, in the evenings, nighttime, mornings?  Or is it throughout the day?  No, it's, it's, um, it's sort of, it's sort of constant.  I forgot to mention that, um, I'm also having, uh, night sweats.  That's very odd, actually, and that sort of makes me retired.  I can imagine, yes.  and this is, again, been going on for the last three, four days, has it?  Yes. Okay.  Right.  okay.  Have you noticed any fevers or temperatures at all?  Um, I had some some fever in the beginning, but it's now sort of going down.  I've been taking some parset more and Ibuprafan for that.  and they help.  That's very sensible.  Very good.  In terms of your chest otherwise,  Have you any difficulty breathing or any pain in your chest?  Um, so no pain in chest, but uh, I noticed that I, um, um, so I feel a bit winded on exertion.  So if I, I, I haven't been going, going to the gym best, uh, because of that.  When you say, when did you feel, do you feel more short of breath, would you say, on exertion?  Is that what you're thinking?  and that's many on exercise, but when you're resting, there's no problem.  Yeah, yeah.  When I'm resting, it's okay.  So I've been actually going to work and sort of managing.  Okay, just a couple other questions servers, if you don't mind, any pain in your ears at all.  Um, no.  You know, you know, if you're blocked to any discharge coming after you is. I don't think so.  Okay, fine.  What I'm going to do,  I'm going to run through a few yes no questions if you don't mind, just a review of your systems.  Any headaches at all?  Um, yeah, yeah.  that that's still that's still there.  Whereabouts are the headaches.  Um, just sort of general, um, and, um, they're not, they're not always there, but, you know, every now and then they would come and go.  Okay, and we just headaches, have any problems with your with your eyesight, your vision?  Um, no.  Any difficulty with seeing bright lights?  No, I don't think so.  Right, okay.  And just moving down now, in terms of any feeling nausea or any vomiting.  Okay, tell me about your bowels.  Are your bowels working okay?  Um, yeah, yeah.  think so.  Boston Urine, okay?  Yeah, yeah.  How's your appetite, sir?  Yeah, I've been drinking a little bit more than the usual, but other than that.  Okay, go.  and you're eating and drinking, are you eating okay otherwise?  Um, maybe a bit less than than what I would usually have.  Have you noticed any funny rashes at all on your skin?  Um, no, no.  and any general muscle pain or aches, joint pain or muscle.  Yeah, yeah, that's that's sort of started in the past couple days.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  and just have a look at the rest of your history.  Are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of?  Um, so otherwise that I'm, I'm fine.  there's um there isn't anything that I'm taking or I'm being treated for.  Okay. So you are the worst kissing world, any allergies at all to any medication, that should be aware of?  Um, no. Okay.  Any family history at all?  anything relevant in the family that I should be aware of thinking like diabetes, high blood pressure?  Yeah, my grandma has diabetes.  My grandma.  Who you say, grandma?  Sorry, my apologies.  grandma, okay.  Do you know what type of diabetes it is?  Is it type one?  I think it's type two.  okay?  Um, anything else which you think is significant?  Yeah, I think one of my great granddads had an eczema.  Excellent.  Okay.  Okay. Just moving on to what we say, so social history, just get to know a bit more as a person.  Tell me, who do you live with at home?  Oh, um, I live alone.  Okay.  And you said you're working at the moment.  that right?  Yeah, yeah.  What do you do for work?  Um, I'm an accountant.  Okay, and how's your work going at the moment?  has it been affecting your work?  Um, a little bit.  I've been a bit slower, and you know, it's a bit of a stressful period just around the end of the year.  Okay.  Is that stress affecting your mood at all in any way?  Um, no, I think I think it's, it's the, you know, it's the good kind of strategy.  It's good work.  Well, if there's anything you ever want to talk to me, but you can always come see me by your mood and stress, anxiety.  We're happy to help.  No, no, I like my job.  It's just, you know, it's a bit more work.  Okay.  And just very briefly, in terms of smoking, do you smoke at all?  Um, yeah, okay, occasionally, no, cigars and things on company parties.  Okay, so not not regular.  and what about alcohol?  Um, occasionally, I would have some.  not a very big drinker.  Again, socially with work.  Um, okay.  So, um, so, just having listened to your story, um, uh, really just to summarise, you know, it's the last 4 days you've been journeying quite unwell, sore throat, runny nose, bit of a dry cough, bit of muscle pain, weakness.  had initial fever, but now settled.  I don't think there's a lot to worry about.  I think you probably have, you know, a bit of a viral, what we say, viral illness and maybe a viral upper spiritual attract infection or maybe early signs of a flu.  These normally last for about 7 to 10 days and just gets better really over time.  But things you can do to really help yourself is get plenty of rest, I'll probably advise you taking a day or 2 off work if you can.  um, making yourself, you know, pushing fluids and make yourself well hydrated, continuing with a regular paracetamol and ibuprofen, um, and we should see how things go, really.  If next week you're still a lot better.  I'd like you to come back and see me.  Is that clear?  Does that make, does that make? Yeah, that's, that's, that's all good.  makes sense.  I think I felt I'll take a couple days off.  Yeah.  and things to look out for, if you're really not getting better, if you have a high fever or your breathing is becoming a bit more laboured or chest pain, I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner.  Give me a call, um, and we can help you out, okay?  Yeah, yeah, I understand. I'll take care.  Great.  Have a great day.  Good luck with your work.  Thank you.
