Hi, hi, hello, I'm Dr. Jacob, welcome to Babylon.  Hello.  Hi. Hi.  So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please?  Get someone over. and your date of birth? 14, 1996.  and your address for me, please.  and 28 clicks wrote SW 191EZ.  That's correct, and just to confirm that you're in a secure location, and we can have a confidential conversation.  Thank you.  Okay.  So you mentioned in in our notes that you've got some tightness, if you could like to tell me a bit more about it, please.  Yeah, so about 2 to 3 days ago, I was running with a friend and usually I could talk to her whilst I ran, but I found myself actually short of breath.  I'm not really sure breath when I'm walking.  Um, but definitely, um, if I'm walking briskly now, um, and I've used my blue inhaler, but to know a bail, it hasn't really helped me.  But yeah.  So I'm having, I'm just wheezing a bit and coughing, just generally a bit short breath.  Wheezing and coughing.  Okay.  And you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler.  So how often are you using the blue inhaler?  Um, I think I'm just using that as and when I have symptoms.  Yeah.  So, at the moment, you are having sharpness of breath.  So are you using it every day at the moment?  Um, yeah, and morning or evening to kind of prevent it as well.  Okay.  which colour?  What's the name of your preventer?  Um, it's a blue, um, I think in totality,  My history of salbutamol, clenyl, cetraben, and hydroculture then.  that I'm taking as well?  Okay, so could you repeat that? Yes, I'll be tomorrow, clennal.  uh cetra ban and hydrocortisone.  and hydrocordisone.  So you have eczema also, yeah?  What's that, sorry?  You do have a history of eczema.  Um, I, brother's asthmatic and my sister had asthma, um, and I've got a few issues, um, that I think could be expert as well.  Okay.  Right.  So, coming back to your, um, you know, your shortness of breath, you've mentioned your easy and your coughing.  Are you bringing up any phlegm at all?  Um, no, I don't, um, I'm not covering up much freedom.  Okay, no speech.  Okay.  Right, Tio.  And um, how are you using your um, your clenel?  So are you using it every day?  Um, I think I'm using that every day and the sound beautiful, just like as and when.  So how are you using the clennel?  Is it twice a day?  Uh, yes.  Okay.  And have you ever been admitted in hospital because your asthma was so bad?  Um, no, I haven't.  Okay.  Right here.  When was the last time you had an asthma attack?  About 3 to 4 years ago.  3 to 4 years ago.  And what, what did the DP do at that time?  Um, just, um, encourage me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative.  Okay, so you didn't have any steroids or steroids or antibiotics.  Not that I can remember.  Okay.  Okay.  Have you ever had all osteroids in the past?  Um, no.  When was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse?  About 2 years ago.  Okay, 2 years ago.  But your asthma was pretty under control till now, isn't it?  Uh, yes, just in the last few times.  So, do you do a peak floor metre at home?  Peak floor reading where you blow into, you know, Do you do that?  No?  Um, just every now and then I haven't done it over the lap since I've had symptoms.  Okay, so what was, what's your peak floor reading then, your good?  Like normal, big flow, reading.  Um, I think, Hunter.  1230?  Okay, let's say it's about 380, yeah?  Yeah.  Three. Okay.  Right.  So that's your normal, yeah?  Right here.  Okay.  So what we need.  Okay, do you have any allergies at all?  Um, I have big fever.  Sorry, could you repeat that please?  Sorry, I have hay fever.  Hey, okay, no, no, any med- allergies to medication.  Oh no, sorry.  Okay, so you're not allergic to anything.  Okay.  So no allergies.  Okay.  Excellent.  Right here.  So what we need to do that, obviously, we eat, you haven't had an asthma check for some time and it looks like you can be having a small, small exacerbation.  So what I would like you to be seen by one of our GPs in the next few days?  In the interim, what I'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as in when.  Okay?  I'm gonna use it maximum about every 2 to 4 hours.  But if you're using it that often, that means pretty much that, you know, your asthma's really bad.  You can use it, but that's not ideal.  The blue, uh, the brown in your kennel, the brown inhaler, you can up the dose, if you're using just 2 cups twice a day, you can increase it to 4 pops twice a day.  Yeah.  And while this is to do while you're waiting to see us.  Now, if you mentioned, you know, you're doing what, you know, increase the kennel to 4 paths twice a day, and you're using the asthma, you know, the blue inhalers every 2 to 4 hours, and your breathing's getting really worse, then you would need to take yourself to A&E.  You shouldn't wait for our appointment.  Okay?  So when the 2 doctor sees you, what we're going to do is because I examine your test, yeah?  Make you do the peak like you're reading.  So depending on what we find, you might need some antibiotics or some steroids.  But anyway, while you're at home, we are going to, by increasing your kennel, we are increasing your steroid intake anyway.  Okay.  So, yeah, so any questions you wanted to ask me?  Am I?  Yeah, so, booking a point, call support, book an appointment to see, and I will recommend that in the face to face.  In the interim, increase your brown inhalers to full paths twice a day and you'll sell beautiful inhalers up to every 2 hourly, but if your breathing's getting worse and would not see enough, you take your breath to any.  All right.  Okay, thank you so much for your time.  You're welcome.  Take care then.  Bye bye now.  Bye, bye.
