Hello?  Hello there.  Uh, hello, can you hear me, okay?  Yes, I can hear you.  Okay, great.  I am, yes.  Dr. Sued here.  Oscar.  How can I help you this afternoon?  Um, I'm contacting you because I've been quite short of breath lately.  Okay.  Do you want to tell me a bit more about it?  start?  Well, it seems to have been slowly getting worse over the last couple of weeks.  and it's become quite troublesome in the last few days.  I kind of, normally I can walk to the shops without a problem, but now I'm having to sort of sit down and catch my breath, and I'm even starting to get a bit breathless, just about the house.  and it's got me kind of worried.  Don't really know what's going on.  Okay. Is there anything you're particularly worried about?  Um, well, I've, I've got, um, heart failure.  I was told that, uh, a while ago, um, and I got a bit breathless when I was 1st diagnosed, and put on some that, that helped, but I'm a bit worried it's just getting worse.  Right, okay.  So you mentioned you've been feeling short of breath for the last couple of weeks, but maybe the last couple of days has got a bit worse.  Um, and you're now feeling more breathless on kind of minimal, minimal exertion you mentioned.  Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?  with your breath.  So, for example, any pain in your chest?  No pain in my chat.  Okay.  Have you found yourself coughing at all?  I've got a bit of a dry cough, but it's not too troublesome.  Okay.  Okay.  And how's your general health otherwise?  Are you feeling weak, lethargic?  Um, I'm feeling a little rundown.  Um, but otherwise, otherwise pretty normal.  I've noticed my ankles have gotten bit bigger.  Okay, what do you mean by that?  Uh, it's just like, they've sort of swollen up a bit.  Okay. Is that is that both? both ankles.  Yeah, both ankles.  it's a bit embarrassing.  Okay, I can imagine, yeah.  And again, over how long has this, have you noticed this before?  Um, I kind of noticed it the last few days.  The last few days.  Okay.  And is this something that you've had before in the past?  Uh, I think my ankles did swell up a bit last time.  the heart failure was a problem.  Okay, okay.  Um, fine.  Okay.  So, just to really recap, so really the last couple of weeks, you've been feeling breathless, but worse in the last couple of days, you mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough and some swelling in your ankles, but importing no chest pain.  and have you noticed your heartbeat racing at all, so palpitations or skipped heartbeat?  No, not really.  Okay.  and any temperatures or fevers?  No. Okay.  and how about your appetite?  Are you eating and drinking okay?  Yeah, I'm that's fine.  Okay, and your waterworks?  Are you passing urine okay?  Yeah, that, yeah.  I usually pee a lot.  the drugs.  Sure.  Okay, all right.  Fine.  So moving on to your past medical history.  You mentioned heart failure.  Any other medical history, I should be aware of.  Uh, well, I was told I had like, uh, they called it like a small heart attack about five years ago.  Um, I, uh, I had, I had, like, a chest pain and they took me at a hospital. and, um, they, uh, but then I just got better.  Okay. When you say small heart attack, did they give you a name for what happened in the name of a diagnosis?  Uh, I can't remember.  I just called it something like that.  a small heart attack.  small horse saying, okay, was it like angina or... No, they said they it seemed, it was like more than angina.  Okay. Um, but, um, I didn't, but I only had to stay in hospital for a few days. and, uh, and yeah, I've been okay since then.  You've been, okay, all right.  So apart from the heart, the heart problems, the heart failure, any other problems I should be aware of?  Uh, no, I think I'm otherwise I'm okay.  Okay.  Do you take any regular medications apart from your diuretics that you're taking?  Do you know which ones?  Yeah, I take something called Ferrozamine.  you know which those you're taking?  I can't remember.  I'm sorry, doctor.  I have to check.  No problems.  Any other medications?  Uh, yeah, I take aspirin.  Okay. and, uh, not prolole.  That metopolo, was it?  Oh, uh, not prolong.  Sorry, the connection is not very good.  Okay, thank you.  Yep.  Um, uh, Simberstan. I'm with that in 8K.  All right.  Any allergies at all?  So your medications?  No, no allergies.  Okay. And anything in the family that's that's important for me to know, any family history of medical problems, heart problems, lung problems.  Uh, my father died of a, of a heart attack.  I'm sorry to hear that.  How old was your father when you passed away?  Uh, he was um, early 60s.  Oh, you 60s, okay.  Anything else I should be aware of?  Um, my mother had osteoprosis.  Okay.  Your mother still with us?  Yeah, she's still living.  All right.  And socially, sir.  Just tell me a bit more about your situation at home.  Who lives at home with you?  Uh, I live on my own.  All right, I got 2 cats.  We've got 2 cats.  Okay, great.  Do you have names?  They're my family.  uh, they're, they're called, um, they're called Holly and Tim.  Okay.  Um, so this is junior cats.  And in terms of day-to-day,  working at the moment?  I work part-time?  as a lorry driver. Okay, and how is that?  Is that quite stressful, long hours?  Uh, it's okay.  Um, I, uh, yeah, like, when I'm working, it's pretty exhausting.  I guess I'm a bit worried that if I get sick, I won't, if I get more sick, then I won't be able to work properly.  Yeah, this is certainly a consideration, isn't there?  So let's try and get you better soon so it doesn't have any impact on your job.  And do you find yourself doing a lot of antisocial hours?  Do you do a lot of night driving, weekend driving? Oh, no, I try only take shifts during the day.  I don't like working at night.  Okay.  All right.  And what about smoking and alcohol, though, because they can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems?  Do you smoke at all?  Not anymore.  So you used to smoke?  Yeah.  How many did you smoke a day on average?  Oh, it's about about a pack a day.  Back in the day.  Um, and how many how many years was that for?  Oh, that was, oh, good 25 years.  Okay.  Well done for stopping.  That must be very difficult for you, but well, I'm for stopping.  And what about alcohol?  I don't drink alcohol.  Do you do much in the way of exercise, sir?  Uh, I try and watch the shops at least once a day.  Okay. But that's about it.  Yeah, I don't, I don't go running like I used to when I was young.  Right, okay. and certainly now your symptoms,  You said you're feeling more breathless, even walking to the shop, you said.  Right.  based on your, based on your history and having listened to your story, I wonder whether you've had a flare up of your heart failure, sir.  um, we can sometimes happen.  And, you know, it's...  So I seem like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be.  and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure.  There's obviously, it's the 1st thing that comes to my mind.  Now, there's a couple of options to move forward.  given that you otherwise as well at the moment and having examined you, your chest and your saturations and blood pressure are all okay, I'm quite happy to increase your dose of fruismoid.  Maybe rather than one tablet day, we can give you 2 tablets today for the 1st few days and see and see how you're getting on.  Okay, if you think that would be bad.  I think it's definitely worth treating your symptoms, but what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart to see how well your heart's pumping.  Okay.  Is that something you've had?  Yeah, so an echo scanner.  It's a jelly scan if you're hot.  You may have had it done before when you were diagnosed, and it's just to get a good. Sorry?  Yeah, I remember now.  Okay, fine.  That's something I can organise for you today and it may take a week or 2 weeks for that to be organised.  But I think certainly in the meantime, let's let's get a blood test done, we can check your, you know, your full blood can, look for signs of anaemia,  We can have a check of your kidney function.  Um, and we can definitely increase your, um, your fruise mind, uh, to, you know, one tap it twice a day.  But I really like, we'd like you to come back and see me in about week's time to see how you're getting on.  Does that sound reasonable?  I think that sounds like a good plan.  And of course, in the meantime, if you are getting more unwell, so if you're getting more breathless or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness, then you know, say, I want you to give me a call sooner than that, and we can have a chat on the phone as well.  Okay, I'll see how I get on.  Okay.  Do you have any questions for me?  Uh, that's all pretty clear.  Thank you very much, Doctor.  Great, no, I wish you all the best.  Have a good day  Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you.
