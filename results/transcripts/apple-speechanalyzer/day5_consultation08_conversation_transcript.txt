And when do you think it lasts, when do you think that asthma stopped?  At what age did you get to a point where you weren't taking medication anymore?  Hmm.  A few years ago, like 3 or 4 years ago, I think.  Yeah.  And so this time, how did it start?  Did you have any other symptoms, any chest pain, temperature, cold symptoms, anything like that?  Yeah, so I has, uh, cold, and cold, and I have a fever.  I also used to walk to work, but recently I can't because it's a feel like very short of breath. and sometimes I feel like I can't even finish saying a sentence is quite difficult to to complete the talking sometimes, yeah, occasionally.  Right.  Have you coughed any phlegm up or anything like that?  No.  Any, any, um, blood in there when you cough?  No, I don't think so.  Okay, and any chest pain?  No chest pain no.  Have you been woken up at nighttime at all?  No, just the time walking.  Have you been able to do any exercise?  No, I can't.  Okay, and do you have a peak flow metre?  at home where you measure your breathing.  Sorry?  Do you have what's called a peak flow metre which you breathe into to get a score on your breathing?  No, no.  and do you normally take any asthma inhalers over the last few years?  Yes.  You do.  So you said you stopped them 3 to 4 years ago?  Oh, um, when I had asked my, youth will take this.

No, I can't, because I used to work, well, to work, but recently I work from home, or sometimes I take sick leave, yeah.  Okay, and when, at the moment, are you feeling short of breath when you're sitting still? Or just walk.  Just walk or sometimes, but currently I feel I feel well.  Are you able to get up and down the stairs, okay?  Yeah.  Right, okay.  Um,  And did you say you were finding it hard to complete your sentences?  Yeah, sometimes.  Okay.  Um, yeah.  Right, okay.  Um, I mean, it sounds like you've had a flare up of your asthma.  It could be triggered by if there's more pollen around or that maybe you may have a viral infection causing it to get worse.  Mm-hmm.  Did you say you checked your temperature already?  Yes, I checked.  Was it normal?  Yeah, yeah.  What was your temperature?  Uh, so...  Yeah.  Okay, that's fine.  Have you got an aspirinhaler at home?  Yeah.  Okay.  So what I would suggest is you take it more regularly than you are doing at the moment.  Have you got a spacer at home?  Um, do you want to show me how to do it though somehow?  Um, do you have a spacer at home?  No.  Okay.  What I can do is I can prescribe you a peak flow metre so we can check your breathing level and a spacer to use your inhaler a bit more efficiently, which the pharmacist can show you how you use that when you pick it up.  Yeah, sure.  and if you increase it, so you're taking it.  2 to 4 puffs like every 4 hours.  Initially.  If you get a high temperature or your wheezing is getting worse, you need to call us back straight away so we can just advise you further with that.  Okay.  and it will be a good idea when you're feeling better if we could arrange just a review just to see how your asthma is because we may need to start some other medication for you.  Okay, sounds good.  You can arrange a review in a week or so.  But, but before that, and if you're, if you're feeling worse.  Yeah, a week.  Right.  Okay.  Okay, and the other thing to do would be to take a regular antihistamine.  which you can get from the pharmacy, I can put a question on your notes about what to take.  Yeah, that would be helpful.  And then, if you, when you get the peak flow metre, if you can take, the pharmacist can show you how to use it, and if you could record a value 1st thing when you wake up, in the evening, over the next week, and then we can discuss that over the phone when we look at the figures and see whether you need to go on another inhaler as well.  Oh, awesome.  Thank you.  Have you got any questions?  Um, no, that's fine.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  Thanks for that.  Bye.  Say hello.
