Oh, no, yes, yes.  Hello?  Hi.  Can you hear me?  Okay, great.  Hello there.  before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please?  Yes.  So my name is Robert.  Robert.  Yep, okay.  Um, I'm 48.  Okay.  Great. Excellent.  And how can I help you this afternoon, sir?  Right.  So, I've been having diarrhoea for, like, let's say, past 3 days, more or less.  Okay, right.  Sorry to hear that.  Can you tell me a bit more about your diarrhoea?  Yeah, so it's been a very bad diary, so it keeps me like, I keep going back and forth to the toilet very often.  Yeah, it started like 3 days ago.  and so it started with vomiting.  So I vomited a couple of times, uh, but then that went away, and uh, yeah, it's just diarrhoea now.  Okay.  and you mentioned you've been going to the toilet very often.  How many times are you going a day?  Yeah, around 5 to 6 times a day. Okay, and, uh, can you tell me, I know it's not nice to talk about, but is it quite watery, your stools, loose?  Yes, it's definitely watery, loose tools, yeah.  Any blood in your stools?  No, not that I could see.  Okay.  And with the diarrhoea.  Have you noticed any other symptoms like tummy pain?  Uh, not not really, no.  But I, I, I feel like, um, I can't really drink too much, so I feel very dehydrated.  Okay, when you say you can't drink too much, why is that?  Yeah, because, really, I, I, I, I'm like, I, I feel like I don't drink enough, like I'm, I'm drink, I'm trying to drink, but then I just go to the loo and I, like, I, I, I boo everything and I feel dehydrated again.  Okay, all right.  Um, have you managed to eat anything solid?  Not much, not much.  So just a little bit, but I don't feel, uh, I don't really feel like I have appetite.  Okay, you advertise repeated.  okay  Um, with your, um, the vomiting is now stopped, is that right?  You said it.  Okay, all right.  Have you any other symptoms, like fever or temperature?  Uh, so not really, I, I feel a little bit warm, um, probably at the, at the beginning,  I was feeling I had a bit of temperature, but now I feel I feel kind of fine.  Okay. I feel very weak though.  All week, okay, all right.  Any headaches or muscle pains?  Not really.  Oh, okay, all right.  And you mentioned 3 days ago, what were you doing when the symptoms started?  Are you aware of any triggers?  Not that I remember.  What was I doing?  I was at home.  I was working on my computer, and yeah, I just felt like some nausea, and I had to vomit, and then I had some diarrhoea straight after that.  Yeah, did you have any takeaway food or any dodgy restaurant food?  Not that I remember.  Have you been around anyone unwell with diarrhoea recently last week or so?  Not that I know.  Okay.  Right, so moving on.  Are you otherwise spitting well?  Yeah.  and do you take any regular medications?  Um, so I do suffer of asthma, so I do have my nailers, uh, that I, you know, I, I use infrequently, let's say only when I have, uh, is that a blue inhaler?  Is that the blue inhaler?  Yes, it is, yeah. Blue inhaler.  Okay, all right.  Any other medications that you take?  Uh, no, nothing.  Okay.  Do you have any allergies to any medications?  Not that I know of.  Okay.  and any family history of any medical problems.  Uh, so my father has high, well, used to have high blood pressure.  He actually, so he actually died of power cancer like 10 years ago.  Okay.  Sorry to hear that.  Um, okay.  and what about your mother?  Oh, yes, so probably is worth mentioning she has diabetes.  diabetes.  Do you know if that's type one or type two?  It's type two.  Okay.  All right.  fine.  And just a little bit more about your life in general, sir.  Who's at home with you?  Who lives at home with you?  Sorry?  Who lives at home with you, sir?  Oh, I leave alone.  You live alone, okay.  Are you currently working at the moment?  Uh, well, I haven't been able to work in the past few days, but yes, like, in my... What's your employment?  What you do for work?  I'm a software engineer  Okay, all right.  Have you taken time off work recently?  Uh, yes.  Yes, I have. This last 3 days I've been feeling really well, so I couldn't work.  Okay, all right.  And just last couple of questions regarding your smoking and alcohol.  Do you do either of those?  Uh, not really.  I drink infrequently, like socially, let's say, and I don't smoke.  Okay, all right.  Um, fine.  So, Robert,  I think having listened to your story,  I think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis.  Okay. which, essentially, is just a tummy bug, is an infection of your tummy.  and normally last for about 3 to 5 days and gets better.  All right. So things you can do to really help yourself get better soon.  or you can drink plenty of fluids, really try and flush the toxin out your body.  Okay. You can get things from the pharmacy, which are called dialect, which can help replenish any minerals and vitamins you may have lost.  Sorry, what's the name of that?  It's called dyrolite.  It's a type of fluid replacement drink.  You can take some paracitamol if you're feeling feverish and weak.  I would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for the next day or 2 until you get better.  Normally you have to be diarrhoea free for about 24 to 40 hours before you return back to work.  Let's see how the next few days go, and if you're still not better next week, I want you to come back and see me, and we can have another look at your symptoms, okay?  That sounds good.  That sounds good.  Thanks so much.  Do you have any questions for me? No, I think that's fine.  Yeah, I'll try to write and drink plenty of fluid and I hope it goes away.  If it doesn't, I'll call back.  Is that okay?  I really hope you get better soon.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks so much for your time.  Bye bye.  Okay, bye.
