And your date of birth? 21, 12, and 19, 86. And your address for me, please. It is number one, London Street. and NW3 6 nw36pq that's correct and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation we are yes okay so i understand you're having a headache is that correct uh yeah i've had a um a sort of a fairly sort of bad spirit headache for the past four days um and i'm i've been sort of feeling a bit hot as and i've got got a bit of a temperature i think i haven't measured it but um i think i think i've got fever okay right and um so what started for us was it the headache or the fever um so um headache started uh first um and then sort of yeah fever sort of came along a bit afterwards okay afterwards Right. And what have you taken so far for your headache? So I've had some paracetamol and some ibuprofen, but it's not really helping at the moment. Okay, so just a few more questions with regards to your headache. So do you find it difficult to look at the light? No, like it's fine. Light doesn't seem to bother me too much. Okay, and is it any pain when you try to move your neck from side to side? Up and down, is there any pain? I've got sort of general aching muscles. Not necessarily sort of in my neck. It's kind of a bit all over, really. Okay. All over. Right. And have you been sick with this headache? No, no, I haven't been sick. Okay. And do you have cough? Uh, no, no cough. Okay, so there's no cough for cold, yeah? Uh, no. Okay. And you, your ears are okay? There's no earaches? Um, no, it, it seems to be okay. That's fine. Okay. All right. And with this headache, have you experienced any pins and needles in your face, arms and legs? No. No, no pins and needles any muscle weaknesses at all um just i suppose general aching body aching not not many weakness but there you couldn't you know hold a cup or anything like that that's what i mean uh no um yeah i'm supposed to be fine with that sort of stuff but yeah okay and um just a few more questions to you because I don't have any of your background history. Do you suffer from any medical conditions? No, general medical history is fine. Fine. And no surgical history that no medical or surgical complaints. Yeah. No. I suppose I have been away to Thailand. It's a week or so ago. I've had some like usual mosquito bites from sort of traveling around and uh it's a friend of mine has also been a bit unwell but um uh yeah that's the only sort of like history per se right and um do you have any kind of shivering at all do you're shivering with the fever um i um uh i do feel cold quite a lot um you know it's um No, it's sort of shivering, but definitely like a bit cold hot and cold yeah yeah okay right and are you using yeah you've mentioned about the parasite malangubriffin now but are you on any regular any medication anything that you're using at all uh no okay um any allergies at all uh no um all right Okay, and okay, so uh i i believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you yeah uh it it's not a force possible for us to do that online i think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination and I think you would need one quite urgently. Okay, so the things that are running in the back of my mind are um kind of a viral illnesses that can one can get with um sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel like the area um the the other common thing around thailand it will be like some dengue but that would have like you would have some uh blood spots or bleeding or something but you don't have at the moment do you uh no i mean i've got a bit of rash but nothing like uh no no no no bleeding okay so where's the rash um it's uh the rash is kind of all all over my body like how would it be how would you describe the rash um uh sort of red and itchy and itchy okay so if you want to put a glass on top of the rash does that rash go away uh yes it goes away okay okay so well what we need to do is we need to urgently examine you and that's sometime today okay And after our examination, there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital, but I'm not sure as yet. So I'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible. Okay. I'll write night notes in and recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor, preferably in the next few hours time. Okay. And in any case, if that's not available, I'd like you to take yourself to A&E okay all right any questions at all uh no it's I'm serious it's you know obviously when I've spoken to you you didn't tick the box for many series but you're in the middle somewhere let's put it that way Okay. If you, you know, things like we have to rule out is meningitis and all, but then you just have a general muscle ache. You didn't say that you had things like you had problems looking at light or something. So those are things when we think of meningitis. But and then it's the in meningitis you get a non-blanching rash while in any kind of virus you know the rash usually goes okay. Saying that we don't know whether these are the beginning stage. So that's why I'd rather but I would rather you see a GP as soon as possible if we've got a slot available but if not I think you need to be seen and maybe have some blood tests and examinations okay okay cool thank you very much all right you take care then bye now
