Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello. Can you hear me okay? I can hear you, but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Is that okay? Am I meant to just have a connection on the screen? It's audio, and I know it's actually fine. Okay. Now, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? So, my name is Dan Chowdhury. I am 727. 27, okay. And how can I help you this evening, Dan? Um, so I've just, um, been having some troubles. Basically, in the, it is, uh, I guess it's been a little while now, and I've just been feeling not so great. And it's all come from, like, uh, it's like, basically, I think it's... diarrhea and it's like just coming out like loads of it. Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it yeah, it doesn't feel very solid. It's a just it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's uh, yeah, it's just uh, not not being very pleasant. And like I just it just kind of hasn't doesn't feel like it's getting better. So. Wow, no, sorry to hear that. There's a lot going on there. Well, when did it all start your simpsons um so i think it was a few when i think about it so monday tuesday i i saw i think it was about three it's been about three days now okay and isn't mainy diarrhea you mentioned watered stools um how many times are you going a day would you say um so i I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake um right what okay so you're losing a lot of fluid there yeah so I mean I'm trying to drink a lot of water but um yeah it's just quite a lot and uh it's yeah I think I feel like it's just just fluids coming out okay have you just seen any blood in your stools um So I, no, I don't, I don't remember anything like, no, I think it's just, nothing like that. There's nothing like that. And any, any tummy pain, any, any, any pain in your tummy? Yeah, I mean, I, I feel, I feel a crap and then, and then I know it's time to go, right? So around every hour, I just feel something come up and then I have to. go so yeah i mean that's that's the kind of the first sign where is this cramped pain which part you're telling me it's kind of i still wanna if i think about it it's like it's like at the bottom uh i don't know if that makes sense um well what do we start with is it is it in the middle or is it to one particular side um i i think if it feels pretty s like in the middle to me not on any side left to right okay and this pain come and go or is it constantly? It comes and goes. It comes and goes. Fine. Okay. And if I was to ask you on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you've ever had, how bad is this pain? Okay. So like, um, so what do you mean by? pain so i i think it's is this pain that's making you double over is it is it 10 out of 10 the worst pain you ever had or is it more of a kind of a mild pain like a three out of ten i i guess so i'm when i think about it like when i get it i can pretend that i don't feel it so i can still sit down and uh i can still like hover it up and people don't really notice so i i don't know what that means but maybe is that like a six or a seven. It's always six, I think. Okay, okay. All right, good. And apart from pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Yeah, I definitely feel kind of nauseous. And I have vomited. I think it's maybe something to do with like... Whenever I have like milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit and actually like, yeah, one time I just like had some milk and I just completely vomited it. I've been trying to avoid it, but um, yeah, that the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea, is that right? Um, sorry, could you repeat that? The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhea, is that right? No, no, it's not. Okay, okay, all right. Any any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? Um, so I, yeah, I think I am pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that, but it's, uh, yeah, I've, I've, okay. Or I'm, I'm, not, uh, like not a normal temperature. Okay, so you're feeling hot, okay? In terms of your water works, are you passing urine okay um yeah but i guess less frequently maybe um but yeah it seems to be okay okay um fine and and you said it mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off are you aware of any triggers i mean have you for example gone out had some takeaway food have you been around anyone else and with diarrhea for example Um, so I know, so my, um, my brother has had actually had something like this for um he has it as well for five days as well um and i i i'm not yeah i can't think of what what the trigger is for me i mean my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me but yeah that's why your brother now better um He said he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not, I'm not really sure. He said, he said he had, he's had something for a little while as well. Okay. All right. Are you having anything to eat or drink? I can see you're drinking your coffee, but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? Um, so it just feels like, um, the fluids do go down, but it just feels like it's going straight through. just feels like it's going straight through okay all right fine when was the last time you had anything solid to eat which kept which which you kept in um so i had some i mean i had some lunch today um But again, it just it just came come out pretty loose. Okay. All right. Um, and and Dan moving forward. Are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical history? So I, yeah, I think I think otherwise I'm fit well. I, yeah, I mean, I'm an okay weight. I can't think of any related medical history. I mean, like my, yeah. No, I don't think think so i'll take you don't take any regular medications then so i um no i mean i i've been taking some like paracetamol and stuff like that lately but i haven't been i'm not on any regular medication or anything like that okay and do you have any allergies any medications Um, so I don't have any allergies that i know of okay and what about any family history do you have any family history of bowel problems um so with bowel like just is the colon like something yeah so what i mean by bowel is a whole gut so my yeah my my dad actually has colon cancer at the moment. Oh dear, I'm very sorry to hear that how is he so um from what i heard he's kind of so i don't i don't speak to him that often so i don't i don't know the exact details and i i don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing but um he's sort of in his third stage uh i'm not sure what that means exactly um yeah okay yeah so Yeah, it's, it's, um, he's, yeah, you can, I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting him a lot. And, um, that's, I guess he's quite, I guess he's, um, had it for a little while now. Well, I'm really sort of, I'll make a note of that because it's important to know these kind of details. Um, and socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan? Um, so, Not my brother, he he doesn't live with me. I'm, I live with my, um, sister and my mum. Okay. And, uh, how are things at home? Um, in what sense do you mean that? In general, day-to-day life, are you managing okay, any particular stressors? I mean, uh, I think, uh, yeah it's been it's been tricky um going to work with all of this um i dislike um taking time off work i feel like i i just want to go um when i can so i try and go um i think at home uh yeah i just haven't really um i i don't normally actually um eat with my family i normally i'm buying stuff and that kind of thing so I don't think it's affected them and I haven't really been I haven't really gone into detail with my sister about it um yeah I'd just rather deal with these things um so what are you mentioned at work what are you mentioned for work what is it you do for work um so I work at a I work at um an office um in government. Okay, so the office, okay, right. There's a couple of last final couple of questions. Smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink much and worry about alcohol? So I smoke for like socially, but not like regularly. um so normally if it's a friday or something like that i might i might have a sticker or something like that but um sorry and the alcohol so alcohol um i you know i might have a beer during the weekdays maybe uh not that many maybe um on fridays i have more um alcohol I buy a lot more units. On it, I suppose, not every week, but maybe once or twice a month that yeah, I go out with my friends and we'll drink a lot so that that's yeah. Well thank you, that's very helpful to know. So Dan, just as a conclusion, Just to wrap it all up i think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis okay a bit of a basically infection of your tummy of your gut there's nothing to worry about i'm i i suspect this will just settle down in the next few days just like it did for your brother make sure you drink plenty of fluids okay and you can just drink like normal water i just feel like every time I well there's just coming out um if fluid is probably best but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins um so you can get things like diurelite which is a fluid replacement which you can get from the pharmacy it's probably worth recommending that do I need like a prescription for that no you can just get it over the counter okay and you can try just you know regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish but if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days so 48 hours i want you to give me a call back because um you know if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations okay but i think let's let's see how you are the next one to two days okay and uh we'll catch up soon okay okay so you're saying that i should i could uh i'll try and buy this diarrhea like What should I do in terms of food food and that kind of thing should I just go fluids food dissolve yeah absolutely it's a clear fluid you can use soft diet things like soup mash and then gradually build up um as much as your body can tolerate um but really let's try and keep us all well hydrated first okay okay is it okay for me to carry on having like um paracetamol and things like that absolutely if you are having if you've got bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think parasessional is very sensible. Okay. Okay. Try and avoid alcohol if you can. Uh, okay, I'll try. Yeah. Okay. All right then. Okay. Thank you for your help. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks.
