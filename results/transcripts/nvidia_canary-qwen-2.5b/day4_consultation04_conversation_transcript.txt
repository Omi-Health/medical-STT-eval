Hi Hi Hi, have you? Yeah, I'm all right. She's feeling a little bit wheezy. Okay, my name is Dr. Gervill. I'm one of the students that went to Navelon. Can I confirm your name and date of birth, please? Yeah, my name is Tina Smith. And I'm 40 years old okay and are you in a space that's quiet and private uh yeah yeah i'm just i'm in my room and you mentioned that you're wheezy can you tell me a little bit more about that yeah so um it started like about two days ago um I don't know if it's because, you know, I was like cleaning the house and like, um all this dust came out of the the carpet and you know I've always the thought that maybe you've got a an allergy to like dust um or something so don't know if it was triggered by um you know two days later still not going to be better so um just getting a little bit worried about it now okay so you were cleaning the house two days ago and that's when it first started uh yeah that's right did the wheezing start suddenly or was it gradual uh so it started after maybe an hour or so and has it got worse over the past two days yeah so it gets a bit worse um at night i find okay and have you taken anything for the wheeze uh no no i haven't actually okay so and the wheeze has been getting worse and today you're particularly worried is it because you're finding it hard to breathe or finding it hard to talk yeah yeah a bit of both actually so um i'm feeling like a little bit uh short of breath okay um and actually when i'm you know talking um to my friends and stuff finding that sometimes I'm unable to complete my sentences. It can get really bad, yeah. And when you can breathe and you take a deep breath, do you notice any pain? No, no, no pain. And have you noticed yourself feeling dizzy or the room spinning more than normal? Uh, no, no dizziness, none of that. And have you been eating and drinking, okay, particularly water? Yeah, yeah, I think I'm having like, you know, four or five glasses a day. Okay. And are you normally fit and well, or do you have any other medical problems? Well, actually, I used to have like a bit of asthma as a child. and also in the summer sometimes get hay fever and when you get hay fever do you take medications for it? Not really okay and your asthma did it resolve when you were a child? I think mostly yeah I mean sometimes when I run for like long periods, it can start up a bit. But I have a, I have like an asthma inhaler. Okay, so do you still have your inhalers? I think I might have one from like a couple of months ago. Okay. But you don't see your doctor regularly for asthma? No, I don't. Okay. And apart from this, do you know if you're allergic to anything? Uh, not that I know of. Okay. And how far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment? Sorry, could you repeat that? How far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment? Uh... They may be minutes drive away. Okay, good. So given that you've had a history of asthma when you were a child and you get hay fever sometimes in the summer, your shortness of breath. Hi, I've lost um video signal. Can you still hear me? Um, yeah, we just heard. So given you've got a history of asthma and hay fever, this could be one of two things. But we want to rule out asthma or an allergy first. So what you'd need is visit one of our clinics so we can do some more tests. So I'll show you. So the first thing we would do is use a small device on your finger. to check the amount of oxygen in your blood. Okay. And from that we can tell if it's asthma or something else. Right. Okay. Before this happens, if you've got something like an antihistamine, which you normally take for hay fever at home, I would take one just in case it is an allergy you've had from the dust. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah, I don't have any antihistamines at home, unfortunately. You might be able to get one on your way to the doctor's surgery. If not, they can prescribe you one. Okay, okay. So I can just get it over the counter then? Yes. And they're normally about four to six pounds. Great. Is there anything else that you're particularly worried about that you want to ask me? Um, um, not really. I mean, I have before taken steroids for asthma. Um, I don't know if that's relevant. Yes, that is and you may need to take some steroids now, but we won't be able to know until we've done those tests first. Okay. Okay. Cool. So I'm going to write a letter for your GP just to let him know what's happened. And the consultation with the GP in person shouldn't take too long. All right. How long do you think it will take? Probably 10 minutes. Okay. That's great. Cool. You should get the letter over the app and then we can you can take yourself to the GP. All right, cool. Thank you very much. Okay, bye. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.
