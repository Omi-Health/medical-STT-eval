Hi there, I'm Dr. Smith from Babylon. Hi. Hi there. Can you just confirm your name, date of birth and the first line of your address first of all, please? Yep. My name is Barry Call. My date of birth is the 19th of September 1993. My address is 64 Cliveden Place in South Wimbledon. Okay, are you in a private place where you can have a confidential consultation today? Yes, I am, yeah. What can I do for you? And I've been feeling really anxious over the past few months. And I just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house and it started to really worry me and just add up and build up on that anxiety and I just didn't know who to talk to so I wanted to check with my GP. Okay. Do you mind just telling me a bit more about when it started? Do you think there's something which changed in your life at that time? I guess so. I think I would say maybe about two months or so I've been feeling like this. And that probably coincides with me starting a new job, which... I would say it's quite stressful. I mean, every job is stressful when you first start but it's been really stressful i think over the past two months definitely what's your job um so i work for a a fashion retailer in and the head office team and it's just a brand new section i've never worked in retail before my boss is not very nice to me and But I also think that it's just been I just really dreads going there. I just hate speaking to her hate like seeing everyone and really worried about whether I'm doing well or not and It's really acting on like on the rest of my life like my sleep and stuff like that Okay, so I'm just day to day tell me from the start of your day how it affects you said you do you dread going to work how does it affect you in terms of like your sleep at night and things like that yeah so I I I as I say like I don't want to go to work in the morning so I just find no way of I can't get out of bed but it's also because when I leave I just when I've left work I just feel so stressed and so worried about everything I've done I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours okay so what time do you go to bed at night time? About 10, 11? I want to get to sleep. Not for ages. I'm lying awake all night. Okay, and when you eventually get to sleep, do you wake up with your alarm in the morning or just something else wake you up for then? So I find my heart kind of racing and then I'm just like panicking that I'm going to be late and that that's going to make work even more stressful so I do have an alarm but I find myself waking up before that because I'm just my heart is racing and actually the other day I was just like I was lying in bed and I really thought my heart was racing so much I thought I was gonna have a heart attack in the morning okay and so how many hours sleep do you think you get tonight I just I can't even tell because I feel like I'm even when I'm in sleep it's such a shallow sleep but maybe three four hours I'm getting now okay and what about your eating patterns any change in how you're eating or whether you let's change probably not significant changes maybe no I wouldn't say that I wouldn't say I'm eating like much differently although I'd probably have more chocolate than normal just because I feel so down okay you're eating wrecking otherwise yeah and you told me about the palpitations just tell me a bit more about that yeah so I'm it's it's usually kind of like when I realize in the morning that either I'm I feel like I'm gonna be late because I've like overslept because I'm so tired um or I wake up in a panic thinking I'm gonna be late so it's just kind of like just a constant like rapid heart beating it's really I don't know if it's stress or I did think it was like a heart problem initially is it for like a regular fast beat or an irregular beat irregular I think and how long do you think it lasts for when you get it Oh, it can be anything. I think it was a couple of minutes or the other day I was actually just sort of lying there for like holding my hand on my chest for like 10 minutes. Okay. Is that something that you've had before this or is that a new thing? Yeah, I would say this is only in the past. So I've like a couple of ones that say that I've really experienced this. Okay. Any chest pain with that? No. Well, yeah, it's painful to win the heart when my heart is being fast but okay but yeah and in the daytime how how you said do you you're not getting much sleep so how's your energy level in the daytime it's just really really low i'm finding now that i'm just i find no enjoyment at all kind of day to day anything i'm doing it's not just my job it's you know when i leave i'm just so tired that anything that previously really fun is just not not enjoyable and i'm like yeah on edge the whole time okay so what do you do in the evenings well right now i'm working so late everything is really a bit stressful so i don't really get much time for myself but when i do you want to go out or you know see friends or just relax it it seems quite difficult to do that Okay, and are you avoiding contact with friends or you still see them i avoid them in so much that i feel like i'm yeah so i mean sometimes it just i know that i'm not gonna have fun because i don't want to go out and do things that i would normally have done okay what about hobbies or exercise or anything else outside work do you do anything else outside work yeah i was just like everything that i've had previously been doing is difficult to continue with. Like I did used to like to like go running and um to play tennis and stuff but now it's just not I'm just not enjoying it. I'm not I'm not like I'm not going out to do that quite so much. And if you is it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work? No, because I think that would just add to the tension. But I do pretty much every morning I think oh I should call him sick or like okay it's not good and what's the worst that it's got have you ever been and so overwhelmed that you couldn't get into the office you couldn't go into a situation yeah um make a tack no I wouldn't say so I think I've always managed to make it to work But I I wonder if it's building up so this is why I want to call so I'm worried it's building up to that and I don't know what to do because I've had feel it felt it it works and works over the past okay and apart from work are there any other situations which provoke quite extreme man quality like being in public places social situations public transport anything like that Yeah, I mean, I find public transport really stressful in a anyway, especially being on the tube, because it's quite getting warmer, so it's just really airless. But I think the majority of it, because my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well. Okay. Before this, did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this? Not really. No, I would say... I mean, everybody always has a bit of tension a bit of anxiety but I've never felt anything that's bad before okay and what about your mood day to day I mean I can see that you're quite distressed by it but do you ever get really down about this um I mean yeah yeah because I do yeah I'm pretty much down like don't enjoy being my day at all because I'm just so worried about everything um and I find that even when I'm not like even at the weekends and stuff it's just the kind of like constant feeling of just being a bit down a bit unhappy when do you think you last felt yourself um I don't know if that's a good question. I can't really put a date on that all and and your mood ever been so low that you felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job or with your life or with your normal things and say we'll carry on I mean no I wouldn't say that I've had I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any thoughts that been that extreme like you know I have I have a good support system like I do have a good family and stuff so I have I don't have worries about actually wanting to and Not go on. It's just that I don't want to go on like this. Yeah, okay, and where do you who do you live with at home? Sorry, who do you live with at home? Yeah, I live with my parents. This is my parents And how much alcohol do you have in an average week do you think? I don't know, probably quite a lot on Friday or Saturday, just because that's kind of normal. Maybe I do have like a bit during the week. My parents obviously are retired, so they just drink whenever they want. So whenever they're having a glass of wine, they'll offer it to me. And it's like, I guess I don't really keep track of it that much. Okay, so how much would you would you guess? Probably like probably quite a lot on Friday or Saturday because it's usually going out. So maybe like, I probably go over my limit just on those days anyway. And then like, maybe a glass of wine during the week. Okay. Do you smoke or take any other drugs on a thing? Um, I try not to smoke, but I do occasionally. But I don't take drugs. Okay. And have you done anything yourself to help? Have you talked to anyone? Have you talked 21, talked 20 counts, done any online, looked online at all? Anyways. I talked to my mum because she also suffers from, or she's suffered from like depression in the past. I didn't think that it was that I was suffering from actual depression because it just seems to be manifesting as tools, as just stress the whole time. But I just talked to my mum about it. I haven't sought any, she'd be recommended that I come to the GP. But I haven't saw any she'd be recommended that I come to GP I haven't saw any other I'm happy to have some one-to-one therapy yeah yeah I've never done it before but yeah I mean what we would suggest in the first instance is to so you can self refer via the NHS for what we call like talking therapy was type of behavioral therapy where they can really look at your situation how you're reacting to the what was provoking the anxiety and what you can do to try and overcome that um so I can send you the link for that um in the meantime so it can be a bit of a wait there are some online resources that are really helpful put the details on there and you can get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well and if you're feeling like it's not helping at all or your anxiety is getting worse to the point where you can't cope with work or you can't just do your normal things day to day then it's important for you to give us a call back and just discuss that further I mean some people with anxiety they do need to take medication to control that but that's not something that we would suggest in the first instance okay and I'll put some more information on your notes about helping with your sleep patterns and things like that that's great I look forward to reading it um in terms of palpitations it is not associated with anxiety but it's probably worth having a couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that there's not something triggering that off and then arranging a GP for a week after you've had the test so we can just go through the results with you okay okay yeah so if you call this phone line you can arrange the have the blood test done okay I'll call them up okay thank you so much all right take care have a good day sorry it's like whatever
