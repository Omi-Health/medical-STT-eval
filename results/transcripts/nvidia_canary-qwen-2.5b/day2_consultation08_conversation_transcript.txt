Hi, good morning. Hello there. Hi there, this is Dr. Dean Mizer from GPR and Hello there, I'm wondering if you could help me today. Okay, sure, I'll try. Before we start, could I please confirm your full name and date of birth? Yes, it's Sarah Smith and it's the 2nd of November 1992. That's great. Thank you, Sarah. Sarah, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? I am indeed. Yes. Okay. So tell me what's been going on. Okay. I've really not been feeling so well at all recently. I've been struggling with fever for the past week. Yeah, I would say it's last about seven days ago. I'm just I'm really hot and sweaty all the time and just generally not feeling good. Okay. All right. Sorry to hear that. Now, um, along with this fever and this feeling hot and any other symptoms at all? I'd say that I'm aching all over, really. My muscles are really aching. I'm feeling quite nauseous. So I've not been able to eat very much. And I have been drinking, but it's been quite a small amount. And you're just generally quite tired and unwell. and sweating during the the night and quite cold okay all right um and um so you you're having periods of when you're feeling hot and also periods when you're feeling cold as well yes yeah it's quite interchangeable not really a pattern to it okay um and have you been taking any medication uh i've been trying to like take other profen and paracetamol just from over the counter that's not really helping just been taking the the recommended dose every day of those and when you say it's not helping is it bring the temperature down at all perhaps slightly yes but i'm still experiencing these symptoms so it does take the edge off of it okay all right and can i just object have you got any cough or cold or sore throat or anything like that not those sort of symptoms really but which symptoms are you getting other than the ones you already mentioned to me um so I have I have a it's mainly just the sweating really and the and the nausea uh that's overtaking all day and the the aching muscles all over sure have you had any ear pain too No, my ear pain is fine actually. I haven't had any problems with my ears. Okay. I just need to check for any other causes of infection in the body. So I'm going to go through some kind of systemic question. Have you had any diarrhea? Um, not, not really. No, no, I've been fine. Okay. Have you got any neck stiffness at all? Um, no. Okay. Thanks. Thanks, been fine. All right. Do you have any headache? Not more than usual now. Just like the general headaches, but not just from staring at the screen. No migraines or anything. Okay. So you know your normal headache. Where is that? The back of the head or the front of the head? It's quite centralized over the head. Okay, and how long have you been having that for? It's something that I've struggled with for years really just related to a screen use or like changes in weather patterns Yeah, high pressure days sometimes I struggle with migraines and headaches Okay, um, have you had any rash in your body anywhere as well? I haven't noticed any rashes, no. I need joints swollen or tender or sore Not really I mean I often have problems with back pain, but not really any other joints Okay, all right problems right and have you got any kind of symptoms down below when you're passing urine? And I know there's been no problems there Okay, any painful urination at all? Not at all, no. Are you passing urine more often than normal? I don't think so. No, it's been fairly regular. Okay. Have you been abroad anywhere recently? Yes, I have actually. Where have you been? I went to Vietnam. I came back four weeks ago now. Okay. And did you take malaria preventative medication when you went out there? I did, yes. Which one do you take? Oh, I can't remember now off the top of my head. Was it a weekly tablet or a daily tablet? I think it was daily. Okay. And was it one tablet or was there another one that you would take on top of the first one? I think it was another one that I took on top of the first one. Okay. And what were you doing out in Vietnam? Was it just you're saying the cities or going to villages or hiking? What kind of activities were you doing? It was quite mixed really because we were there for a few weeks and we toured several different parts of the country and the countryside and some cities as well. Okay. And did you do any kind of were you in rivers or things like that were you you know how adventurous were you i'm sorry could you repeat that i missed that were you going out into the rivers were you going on beaches i mean how adventurous was your trip yes it was quite adventurous we were sort of trekking and um cycling uh through farmland and um seeing how people lived in their day-to-day life in and in farmland right okay um thank you for sharing that with me now do you have um any other illnesses at all in the past as i said i've been struggling with back pain for quite a while but i haven't really had any um major illnesses in the past i can think of and that back pain have you um have you seen anyone about that Yes, yeah, I'm under a physiotherapist at the moment for that have they given you any kind of diagnosis talk um they've said that it's related to long periods of time sitting at a desk and just a bad posture so mainly the exercises are focused on improving posture and and strength of the muscles in the back all right um are there any illnesses in your family at all? The main one would be heart attack. My father passed away of that. So it is a heart attack. I hope I'll see when that happens. 68, I think. Yeah. Okay. Are you on any medication at all? Just Sarazette? Okay. Are have any allergies at all, talking about medication? No, I'm just really pollen allergy. That's all I have Okay, so hay fever. Yes, yeah, just hay fever. All right. Um, are you um, you're working at the moment? Uh, I am. Yes. What do you work as? I work as an ass. Okay, all right. And you update with all vaccinations, hepatitis B, that kind of thing? Yes, indeed. Yeah. Okay. But I'm really struggling quite a lot of work at the moment. Sure. I've been quite different, feeling so tired all the time. Sure. Okay. And are you a smoker at all? No, I'm not. Okay. And have you drank much alcohol? Moderate alcohol intake. I don't drink too much. And how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally? I try and do some moderate physical exercise a few times a week. Okay. That's good. All right. So what I think we're going to need to do is we're going to need to bring you into one of our clinics exactly and we're going to need to arrange some blood tests as well. Okay. So what I want to do is the first question I have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this fever and these symptoms because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me. There's no, when someone has got fever and sweats, we want to find out have they got chest infection, have they got a throat infection um and if we can't find a focus of infection then that's something that's an outstanding question that needs to be answered okay um the second thing second factor is that you've recently come from uh vietnam and you had exposure to rural areas and we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well so um you're probably going to need some blood tests after you've been seen by somebody Now, the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you, which is why we're going to go for the examination first. Okay. Come into one of our clinics in central London. That's one option. And then the GP there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be. Or if it's inconvenient for you to come into central London because you're living further out. you could actually just attend a local A&E I'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of tests I think you need in the notes for this appointment so you could show that to them at reception I'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films to check for malaria and inflammatory markers and things like that it's technical terms but they don't understand what that what I'm talking about but um I don't think you can go into work until we've sorted this out and we need to sort this out sooner rather than later okay okay that sounds great thank you so much for your help i i think yeah i can come straight into central london today to get that sorted okay fine so what i'm going to do is i will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in and if you can ring the number that i leave in your consultation notes after a few minutes and then they'll slot you in and then we can sort things out from there okay That's brilliant. Thank you very much. All right, then. Okay, take care then. All the best. Goodbye. Bye.
