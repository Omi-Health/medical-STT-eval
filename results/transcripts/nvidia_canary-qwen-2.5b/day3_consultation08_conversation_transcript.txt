Yeah, it's just like coughing and like runny nose and like kind of muscles aching and stuff, like occasionally just like feeling like, you know, cold, chills and things like that. Hot and cold, yeah. And so about your cough, are you bringing up any phlegm at all? No, no, it's like a dry cough. It's sort of like almost hacking. Oh, hacking kind of like. You're not bringing up any blood, are you okay are you feeling short of breath at all no no no shortness of like yeah breathing fine yeah so you're not wheezy also rattling noises in your chest no okay um right so what have you taken so far uh say uh just like painkillers and such i mean i i'm in addition to like my normal medication and such um but like so you mentioned and you'll come to your normal medications but you've mentioned you've taken some painkillers like would you tell me the names please i'll just like paracetamol paracetamol okay any ibuprofen at all no okay and also You mentioned some regular medication. Unfortunately, I don't have your medical of complete medical history so if you could tell me what your medications are and what you use them for yeah so I say um uh let's call this I met for women I'm a diabetic so and um I'd also like have uh this is in approval this is in approval okay yeah for the like the blood pressure yeah okay and how long have you been a diabetic for? Um, like a few years, maybe five or six years. Five, six years, okay. Okay. Do you monitor your blood sugars at home? Yes. Okay. And how have they been doing at the moment? Uh, no issues, nothing like out of the ordinary there. Okay, so there's no problems with your blood pressure control at the moment, even though you're not, okay, that's absolutely fine. And when was the last time you took your blood pressure? Uh, it had been this morning. This morning. And what was the readings like? I can't remember off the top of my head, but it was within the normal range. Oh, because there was nothing alarming, yeah? Normal. Okay. It's fine. Okay, so that seems all right. Okay, so can I, hypothetically, look into your mouth, yeah? Sure. Yeah? So just, yeah. So looking into your mouth, you know, there's just a bit mild redness at the back of your throat. There's no enlarged tonsils. Can you feel any glands around your neck at all? No. I haven't had anything like that okay so it looks like it's just a viral infection um because it's just a cold and a cough there's nothing there and generally if you have things like a chest infection you would have a bit like a wheeze or shortness of breath so um things that we would recommend is you can use the you know night nurse, day nurse, it's still okay with your medications yeah so I'm sure you're a bit wary to use them but it's still okay with your current medication you can still use that might be able to make you feel a bit more better quickly if there's any change like you're feeling short of breath or the your symptoms are lasting more than three weeks or something or you're becoming poorly things like that then you need to get in touch with us then probably we might need to examine you and especially your chest but i don't think so that's necessary at this point in time okay that sounds good okay any questions at all uh no i i think that's that's been very helpful thank you okay so just to round it up just use the night night nurse, day nurse, if any change in your symptoms like shortness of breath, wheezy or symptoms are lasting more than three weeks then get in touch with us okay if i don't need any prescription or anything you don't need anything at the moment okay take care then thank you very much
