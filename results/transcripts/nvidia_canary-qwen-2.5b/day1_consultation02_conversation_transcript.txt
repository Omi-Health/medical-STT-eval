Hello? Hello? Can you hear me well? Uh, yes, I think it's a bit better. It's a bit, it's a bit, it's not very clear, but let's continue anyway. Okay, okay. So, how can I help you, sir? Yes, so it's been a few days now. I have like a sore and a red skin. It's kind of, it's really itchy and it's like super annoying. So I'd like to... find something quick to sort it no no problem i'm happy to help. Whereabouts on your skin is it affected? Mostly like my chest, my hands, my arms, like I agree it's super annoying, like it's itching a lot like all the time and I can't even sleep at night. Like I really need something quickly to sort it because even at work I... like when I'm in the meeting and I have to like think about my work and focus like actually focus on my work it's really annoying because I can't actually think about what I have to say I'm always like disturbed by this disease no no okay I understand this is obviously affecting you and we'll try our very best to get us sort it out for you um have you had anything like this before in the past um so yes uh earlier I was like prepared for my eczema okay and they gave me like some cream and something to uh when i like was shower when i was in the shower i had to put something okay but um did it help and i mean at that time yes but those symptoms like these symptoms are like when these symptoms appear again i tried those and it didn't work i've tried a few things like i bought like a steroid cream at the pharmacy last night but it apparently didn't help because it's still itching a lot today okay uh yeah do you remember the name of the cream you bought uh stirred cream okay stirred okay um do would you say the symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different um it's much more like itchy and My eczema was more like only in the arms and now it's also on the chest and in the and the on the hands as well okay yeah when like i like for instance hiking during the weekends and i am i can't really do it anymore because it's like very like like i wanted to do that last weekend and it was super painful and i have to take like showers every day to be able to kind of uh ease this itching part which is very very annoying no well okay that's okay so you mentioned the itchiness You also mentioned it's been quite sore. Have you noticed any bleeding or discharge from your skins? No. So my skin is a bit cracked in some parts, like kind of cracked, if you see what I mean. Okay. But, yeah. You don't have any other pus or blood coming out of your skin? No, no. And you mentioned it all started three days ago. Four days ago are you aware of any triggers so anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start so for example have you changed your uh shower gel any clothing have you been around anyone it's actually like it's really annoying because i'm thinking about maybe i should change something because i i haven't and i don't understand and i'm kind of um afraid of asking people around me because it's kind of you know I don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions it's kind of intimate and so I'll put your head now no no okay that's okay um fine so just to re summarize for the last four days you've had very itchy skin very sore skin all over your body man your chest and did you also mention your arms and legs as well and no just the chest my hands and like like inside the air glands okay anything on your face at all in my what on your face oh on my face no no okay and apart from this any other symptoms have you noticed for example have you noticed any temperature or fevers no no just the itching it's nothing else okay so your your bowels are working okay your chest is okay no cough no breathing difficulties no you're passing urine okay uh i think so okay all right um it's always good to know so i mean do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms anyway any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms And so I had eczema before so maybe it's this but it seems like more like my eczema was only on the arm so I'm not sure I I really have no idea. Okay. That's okay. So normally at this stage I like to examine you to see the rash itself and see exactly what type of rash it is. But from what you've told me you mentioned it's you've got some dry skin and some cracked skin as well. And it's been very itchy. And so with your, your background of eczema, sorry, so there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you, which I completely forgot, my apologies. Apart from eczema, do you have any other medical problems? I should be aware. No, I just had asthma in the past, but not anymore. Not anymore. Okay. And do you take any regular medications at any kind? Uh, no. No, okay. Do you have any allergies to anything? Sorry, yeah. Sorry, I was going to give you allergies to anything. Hello. Hello, yes. Oh, can you hear me? I was wondering if you cracked. Do you have any allergies at all? Oh, allergies, uh, no no okay um and tell me about your um uh your situation at home who do you live with uh so i live with a few flatmates i'm uh so you know i'm 31 uh i yeah i have a full-time job and so i'm living with a few people to save money okay and what do you do for work uh I work at a pharmaceutical company, so it's been a few years now. It's kind of interesting. We're working here. I'm like a kind of project manager. I mean, do you want to know more about it? Okay. No, no, no, that's actually fine. Just a couple of questions I want to ask you, which can sometimes affect your symptoms, is do you smoke at all? No. No, and do you drink much in a way of alcohol? Uh, you know, once in a while I can, I like hanging out with people once in a while. So yeah, say a few, a few beers per week, something like this. Nothing, nothing crazy. I used to drink a lot more when I was younger, but it's been, it's been okay. Okay, I've got to say at this stage, I've got to say the sound quality is not, uh, great, but I will continue because we've come this far. Um, so, um, based on everything you mentioned, sir, I, I do wonder whether this is a flare up of your eczema. The reason being that you said it's quite itchy. It's mainly affecting your chest and your back. And having looked at your skin, the rash does appear quite familiar. You mentioned you using steroid creams yesterday from the pharmacy. I wonder whether giving you stronger prescription of this of a steroid may be beneficial uh which i'm happy to prescribe to you today as well i'm gonna give you something some emollients which helps to moisturize the skin which you use in the bath and shower and it's definitely worth uh using that for the first seven to ten days uh before we make a decision on whether it's working or not um it's also worth um using antihistamines which you can sometimes buy over the counter, things like loratadine or piritan, which can help the itchiness of your skin. And it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap, because if that's causing your symptoms, then we need to have a discussion about that next time i see you okay just i i have tried anti-histamines uh lately but it didn't really help oh could you say that again sorry i have tried the anti-histamines okay but it didn't really help it didn't okay so there's something for you to think about you can get different type of anti-histamines i can give you something a little bit stronger today as well um something like fexofenadine which i can give to you today it's definitely worth trying it's not going to do do you any harm, but I certainly think using the steroids and the emollients on a regular basis over the next week to ten days should hopefully control your symptoms, but do come back and see me next week if things don't get better. That sounds good. Okay. Do you have any questions for me? No, that's it. Okay, well I wish you all the best. Thank you very much. Thank you, have a good day. Bye. Thank you, Victor. Bye.
