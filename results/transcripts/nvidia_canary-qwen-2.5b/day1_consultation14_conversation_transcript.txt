Well, I've just been having this like cough for quite a few days and my nose is running. I've just been super annoying and it's not going away. What do I do? Okay, when did it all start? I think it started like maybe a bit less than a week ago, like maybe, maybe five or six days ago. Okay, and you mentioned a couple of things that you mentioned a cough, you mentioned a bit of a runny nose, right? Yeah. Okay, let's focus on your cough first. Can you tell me a bit more about your cough? It's just so continuous. It's really, really frustrating. It's quite dry and it's just all day, it like keeps me up at night as well, which is really annoying. Okay, so it's a dry cough so you don't bring up any you don't bring up any oh i can hear that yeah and you don't bring up any uh mucky flam or anything like that no okay so keep you up a nice um you mentioned uh the cold symptoms as well the runny nose do you have a do you have a sore throat as well i mean apart from i mean the coughing is giving me a sore throat but it's not like you know not more than that. You know, just my throat is irritated from coughing, but it's not like, it's not that bad when I swallow or anything. Right. Do you have any, how are your ears? Your ears feel blocked? No, they feel okay actually. Yeah. No pain or discomfort in your ears? No pain, no pain on the ears. Okay, all right. Fine. In terms of your breathing, how is your breath? How's your chest? Is your breathing more labored? I don't think so. Like, I guess like it's labored when I'm coughing and I can't breathe, but I not, yeah, I don't think when you walk around, you don't feel breathless. I don't feel breathless. No, I feel, you know, generally tired. Okay, okay. Yeah, but not not anything special with my chest any pain in your chest no not my back either okay you mentioned feeling tired um have you felt feverish at all at a temperature um i'm having like like shivers even when i'm in when i'm in beds you know like when you when you go to sleep and and you feel like i should be warm but i'm still still you know shivering a little bit so I have to keep my temperature so I'm not 100% sure if I had a fever but it feels like I probably did because I was just I was next to my boyfriend and he was completely warm and totally fine and I just I couldn't stop shivering and I kept adding more sweaters on and I was still cold okay okay okay all right um fine in terms of any other symptoms have you had any nausea have you had any vomiting no no no not here no vomiting like um yeah nothing like that how's your appetite um i mean it's okay i at the beginning like when i was starting to have this the symptoms the the coughing and stuff um i had a little bit of diarrhea um but but i didn't it didn't cut my appetite or anything I just like My stomach wasn't feeling great Okay, I got better now the diarrhea. Yeah, it got better. It was only like the first Like it started at the same time as the cough started and then it stopped I thought everything would be fine, but then coughs just stop going Okay, fine. Um Any problems with your water works at all? With my what? Your water works your urine Oh, no, no, no, that's fine. fine. Passing urine, okay. You're drinking plenty of fluids and passing urine, okay. Yeah, I drank loads of water when I started having the diarrhea. Now that it's stopped, I just went back to normal. Okay, all right. In terms of any other thing, did you notice any funny skin rashes or problems with your muscled or joints? Like my... You know when I had to, when I was telling you i had like the i had chills and i was really cool my muscle was really hurting okay but like it's hurting me so much at the moment right um uh to be honest all i feel like doing is just lying in bed right okay okay i'm sorry that must be very difficult for you yeah okay especially like in my arms my legs like just everywhere basically but don't quite a little digestion week. Mentioned. Yeah. Okay. April, are you normally otherwise fitting well? Am I normally what? Fitting well. So do you have any other medical history? Well, I have type 2 diabetes. Okay. I have quite high blood pressure. Okay, and what you take for your blood pressure? What medications you take on a regular basis? um i take metformin for the diabetes yep i take with an oprel for the high blood pressure okay fine any allergies at all to medication no allergies no okay regarding any family history is anything i should be aware of um my dad also has type 2 diabetes but i think that's it there you go all right Who's looking after your diabetes? Anyone, do you have a doctor in hospital? I just regularly go see a doctor. I just check stuff on it. Same with the high blood pressure. Like I have it under control. And since I started taking this medication, I've just been like regularly checking that it's under control. Right, excellent. In terms of your social situation, who lives at home with you? It's just me and my partner. Okay, fine. Is your partner well in the moment? Yeah, he has none of this. Like, he's just going ahead, like, like nothing. Like, I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him, but he's fine. He's got away with it at the moment. Okay. And are you working at the moment, April? Uh, yeah, I am working. But the first day I skipped because I was feeling just too shit. Yeah. But then I just felt like i had to go back because i had so much to do i've been going in but it's not been fun no i can imagine what is it that you do for work uh i am a developer so you work in the hc field okay yeah working hc field right okay not too active a job No, it's been quite stressful recently. Not more than usual. I don't think it's related to stress like i i don't feel like i've had a particularly hard time at work um to take a day off to try and recover so yeah i don't think they did some reason i ask is sometimes stress can really affect your immune system um but uh it's good to know you you're not feeling stressed um do you smoke at all april i used to but i've stopped for about six months now okay um and what about alcohol i mean yeah i don't think i drink that much like i don't really know how you count the units but i guess like i don't drink more than like like say three evenings a week and i rarely get like properly drunk or anything and what is it that you drink wine mostly and wine how much do you drink on those nights uh i'd say like maybe two or three glasses okay so um yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of um the recommended limit something maybe you need to think about just because of your blood pressure and diabetes maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can yeah i think i should cut down on that really ideally the the right answer is to cut down completely but so in practice i know that's not realistic so maybe for the first few weeks one you can answer two glasses a week and then one week thereafter um and if you are coping okay then we can maybe try and cut down all together okay okay just something for you to think about um Right, so as we wrap up, really, hey, Paul, I think based on your story, I think essentially I think you're going through a bit of a viral illness. I don't think there's anything to worry about. You know, you've had a bit of a cough, bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic. I'm hoping that, you know, you're probably over the worst of it now. It's been five days. I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better the next... couple of days normally lasts about a week to ten days what what should I do if it just keeps going on and on like if it's still going on in and say four days Yeah, absolutely. So, you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to you know get some nice good rest Drink plenty of fluids. Keep yourself well hydrated. You can take a regular paracetamol If you feel like it's still not getting any better in two to three days, it's probably worth coming back to see me again We can check you over And if you are still feeling feverish and your cough isn't getting any better then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest which can sometimes be a common source of infection. Do you think I should keep going to work or do you think I should just Yeah, so I think they really, I think it depends on you. It's if you are coughing, then there is a risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still. So I would say maybe take a day or two off work if you can and get some good bed rest and maybe think about work early next week okay okay but um if your cough isn't getting any better or your breathing is getting worse I want you to come back and see me sooner okay okay but otherwise I don't need to worry no no nothing to worry about otherwise okay all right thank you very much have a good day appreciate it thank you bye
