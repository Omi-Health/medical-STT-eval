I can't really hear very well in my nose that my face has been feeling a bit numb recently. Right, okay. Okay, and how long has this been going on for? It's been a few weeks now, in about three weeks or something. Right, okay. And is this just on one side or both sides? Just one side, just on my left side. I've noticed that the hearing side has gone down a bit. Right, okay. And your face feeling numb, where exactly is that? Which part of your face? Can you show me with your finger? Yeah, so again, it's the left side. It's kind of like around my left ear and kind of... along here so like my jawline just all being a bit numb around here right okay okay um has anything else happened um in this time any other symptoms you had at all not that i i've noticed it's just going occasionally i just have a weird feeling in my ear and it's ringing yeah okay yeah sure okay um and um Have you had any weakness or numbness down the in the rest of the body at all? No, no, no, no, nothing like that. Okay. Have you had any difficulty swallowing? No. And have you had any difficulty speaking? No. Have you noticed any problems with your vision at all? No, that's all good. Okay. And do you have the numbness present right now? Uh, yeah, it's kind of kind of there there what happens at full time. So yeah, right now it feels very, doesn't feel like when I touch this side of my second. Sure, sure. Okay. All right. Just going back to the kind of muffled hearing feeling in the ear, do you have any discharge coming from that ear at all? No, nothing coming out. Any pain in the ear or from the ear? None. Right, okay. um have you had any fever at all right nothing like that and do you um have any itchiness in the ear right do you use cotton wool buds to kind of clean your ears out i don't oh no no no okay all right um She need to ask a few other general questions. Do do you have any other illnesses at all um i well i've got kind of been told i had polyps and o's in the past and occasionally get some kind of half burny feeling um that's all fine and you know i take a renee if i need to and if my neck polyps are playing up i've got a spray um other than that i think they said ages ago i had something called not quite remember but labrinitis something like that. But again, nothing, nothing on that. Sure, okay. So are you on any regular medication? You mentioned the spray for your nose. Yeah, so no, I only take the spray for my nose when I need it for, and sometimes take over like Redi, but I just get that from the chemist. Sure. And the spray for your nose, where do you get that from? Is that from a doctor? Yeah, they gave me a prescription ages ago. Yeah. Do you remember the name of the spray tool? Unfortunately, i don't know sorry that's the one that's fair and you're not on any other medication at all that's no okay do you have any any allergies to any medication uh no just latex latex okay all right let's continue um and um in terms of your family are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all my brother had neurofibromatosis i think it is Right. Other than that, everyone else is okay. okay good that's good um and in terms of your own kind of background now are you are you working at the moment yeah so i'm a i'm a jockey um but because of all the kind of these symptoms of the game especially sometimes when i get a ringing i feel a bit dizzy um i've just had to do far less training so kind of beginning to yeah impacting work um a little bit now okay so you have to exclude you like with horses. Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. All right, okay, fine. Great. And do you live alone? I live with my partner. Okay, right. Do you have any pets at all at home? No, no pets. Okay, fine. Fantastic. All right. Is there anything else that you wanted just tell me about what's been going on recently uh no just like like i said like the ringing um occasionally and when i get back i can sometimes be a bit dizzy but the main thing is really the lack of hearing and the numbness that's got me up the side yeah no idea what's going on that okay fine all right um so what what i think we go on There was one thing I think, because I can panic and you can look online a bit frantic I guess what I'm trying to think is you know is there something particularly serious that you know will need to be sorted and obviously really anything could make you really frantic and is it maybe nothing so serious I would die from it I don't know I just I think Obviously, we're limited in terms of assessment via video uh portal but um from what you've told me this doesn't seem to be anything um that you're gonna die from however I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today okay I would like you to come into one of my clinics I'd like uh GP to assess you yes what you're describing might be something called belt palsy yeah um We can go into that explaining what that is if and if that's confirmed on on physical examination That's not usually a life-threatening problem, but and part of the reason why I'd like to come in is just that we can just do a what we call a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on and Confirm that might be the diagnosis have a look at a look inside the ear see if there's any pro anything to see within the air so um so In answer to your question, no, I don't think that you need to worry about that. I think, you know, preliminarily I can, I can reassure you. However, do you know, in order to definitively reassure you, I think you need a physical examination today. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to send a message to admin team. I'll ask them to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics within central London. Okay, and then you can ring the support team number. I'll leave that number in your notes. You can ring them after five minutes and then they'll slot you into a place that's convenient for you okay that's fine all right so someone will see you and hopefully we'll be able to reassure you further but please make sure the appointment gets done today okay yep they will do that's fine thank you very much all right then okay nice to see you take care bye
