I am. That's right. Thank you very much. All right, so you've mentioned that you're not having much of an appetite and energy lately. I'm sorry to hear that. Could you tell me a bit more about it, please? That's right. Started long, long ago now that I've been feeling down and I didn't really have energy. My wife was starting to complain as well in nightly activities. And I just... felt like I needed to call you guys and needed to get some some more information about what could be going on. It's just that, yeah, nothing is like feeling right. I feel out of place and and it's it's yeah, just just down. So so you are you telling me that your your mood's low? Is that what you're trying to tell me? Yes, you're like I'm feeling short of breath. breath it's like always yeah out of energy i would say yes that's the energy that's my mood would you say you're depressed um you you never want to say that do you it's a tough one isn't it because you don't want to actually say i mean i mean work is okay um i have trouble at work sometimes having headaches feeling nauseous um but i can do my work that's that's okay do you do your work again do you like your work um who likes to be a lawyer sorry that was me um yes of course i like i like you like your work okay and um you and how are things at home all right are you having any kind of stress at all? It is okay. Sometimes because I'm having a loss of appetite, I'm Yeah, I'm not eating very much and Other than that, it's it's okay. Yeah, and have you lost any weight? I Have a little bit. Yes, but that's over over a long period now okay right so you mentioned that you've lost your appetite for a while now so how long I'll be talking about that must have started when I when I changed over to the new law firm I would say months ago we talking about two months three months or six months if you could uh Three months ago, three and a half months ago though. Half months ago. But you said your weight loss is much longer than that. Yeah, it's not really that. Uh, yeah. Sorry, could you can I couldn't hear you. What did you say your weight loss how long? I started a little bit earlier than that. I I'm not sure though how it is. Roughly six months would you say something like that yeah six months and roughly how much have you lost just approximately oh gosh i would say less than a stone so about a stone yeah six months okay see okay Right, okay, so just a few more questions. It might seem a bit awkward, but it's quite relevant. Okay, so how are your bowels? Are they okay? I feel nauseous every now and again. It's coming up. Yeah, just every now and again, not feeling very good, trying to eat something, but don't really want to. Yeah, your bowels, how's your toilet? That's okay, I would say. I don't really have problems when going to the toilet. It's just been less. So you're not going to the toilet? Yes, yes. You are going. Like, to be very more specific, you don't have any diarrhea? No, no diarrhea, no, no. Okay, so there's no blood in the poo no mucus nothing of that sort uh no no just you know you mentioned nosed yeah have you been ever sick with it no actually not yeah i'm feeling unwell uh in the in the in the bowel region yeah Just the nausea. okay is there any particular foods that make you nauseous no not okay so you can't think of any meal do you suffer from acid reflux I do not no okay okay you've also mentioned that you're feeling short of breath so yeah is there any cough Um, no, not really just Okay, it's like when when that when I go into the lift uh, it happens to be that I like, you know, my heart starts beating and I can't really breathe. Yeah, is it like in closed spaces? No, it happens every time it happens very significantly in in the lift or when I'm when I'm there. So how far can you walk and when you start feeling short of breath? So how far can you walk with no shortness of breath? Um, walk or run? Walk. We'll start with walk. Do you feel short of breath? Let's start this way. Do you feel short of breath when you walk at all? No, actually not. Right. So you can walk about a mile and you don't feel short of breath at all that's right yes okay so just explain a bit more just to make myself clear about the lift thing so you said you're short of breath when you're in the lift yeah my heart starts beating i i feel like i can't breathe and and uh it's it's it's very difficult to uh yeah to explain uh it's going yeah just just that you you know when when you just feel unwell and yeah your heart's like that's why them like palpitations to me yeah so that's what you're if you're feeling your own heartbeat yeah yeah okay do you get any chest pains with it not really no it's just yeah okay no chest pain no chest pain okay all right. Fine. So what we need to do, just before that, just a few more things. Any past medical history you'd like to share with me today? Yes, I had too little activity of my thyroid. Sorry, you had thyroid problems. Thyroid, too little activity, yes. Oh yeah, underactive thyroid yes yeah yeah yeah um and in in in so that i took thyroxine yeah you're taking thyroxine you're using it every day uh not anymore why is that i have not been taking it in the last actually since i changed law form i would say okay so is that so all these things are since you've stopped taking the thyroxine? Oh, that might be coinciding. I'm not sure about that. When was your last blood test? Uh, haven't taken one in a long time. Okay, so you've not had a blood test. Right, okay. It could, you know, generally for, you know, it for underactive thyroids what symptoms you've said It's the opposite that usually happens. Yeah, it's for all the active thyroid like you can feel a bit like the right racing of your heartbeat and all so I'm not quite clear what picture we are having here. Yeah, I think General set of bloods is a good idea, good start. So what we look at because you're not you're not having the um aren't you you're like you're just feeling a bit you know low and things like that right yes um and weak and things like that so we'll just do a general set of bloods we look at things like anemia how your kidney functions are your livers all that with vitamin levels and your okay Now after we get those set of bloods, we will find out if we can find anything in there if that's all clear then we would need to do a physical examination okay okay we would need to go in and do the thing but there's nothing from what you history you said that that we urgently warrant a physical examination at this point in time I think it's a good idea to start off with the blood test and then take it from there. Obviously with palpitations or chest pain, if you get that's more of a medical emergency you need to go to A&E for that okay if things change you've mentioned now your bowels are fine and you're not being sick so if that's the case it's okay but if your you know bowels change or you're being sick again you need to get in touch with us okay okay we have been walking lately sorry could you help me there Yes, I haven't been walking lately at all. So it's like really hard for me to identify when i feel the shortness of breath i just wanted to add that into because um i haven't been walking i haven't been feeling good enough or good at all so okay so let's do all the blood tests first and we'll take it from there okay but you know if you have any chest pain or change in bowel habits do get in touch with us I will. Yes. Now, what we need to do is now you need to ring up support and i'll do the form for you but in the interim you need to call support so that we can organize that blood test for you and once you get the result you will receive a text message through your phone to tell you to book an appointment okay if you're feeling poorly don't wait for that just get in touch with us again yeah I will. How do I call support? Oh, there's the number on your app yeah if you open up your app there's the number on that it's an old 300 number yeah so just call that number i will find it thank you all right then you take care bye now thank you
