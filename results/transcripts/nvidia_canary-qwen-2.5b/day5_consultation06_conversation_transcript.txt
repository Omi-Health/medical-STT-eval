Well, apart from the fact that this one is giving me abdominal pains, no previous abdominal pains before. Obviously, you get the odd, you know, menstrual cramps and all that, but you know, that's, you know, that comes and goes. Okay, and whereabouts is the pain that you're getting? It's kind of like towards my naval area. Like I can't touch my naval area it's just so soft and it gets yeah towards like the center of my naval um and does the pain coming go yes it doesn't come when it comes i feel the strong urge to go to the to the loo and then thought it releases me and sort of like comes again it comes okay um And do you take any medication regularly? Well, I I take my my vitamins I call it vitamin D Okay, every day that's about that's about all that I regularly take And have you got a normal diet? Yeah, I eat well normally right do you smoke or drink alcohol? Well, I don't smoke for you know, I have a pint from time to time and you take any other drugs No, like I said, I only take a vitamin. For my menstrual cycle, when it comes, maybe I might take a, a, a, and I think just to eat the pain. And when was your last period? Um, two weeks ago. Okay, are you on any contraception? No. Are you having regular sexual intercourse? No. Okay. And, and what's your job? I'm I'm a I'm a graphics designer. Have you had to miss work because of this problem? Well, yes, I've had to actually work from home today. I'm working from home today because I can't I can't be out for work. Okay. And who do you live with at home? I live with my brother and my mom. Okay. And have you tried anything yourself for this problem? Well, I've tried a home remedy. I've tried the ORS, you know, thing above from my local... Can you just repeat that? the ORS the the salt sugar ORS um um mix the salt sugar mix okay and how often have you been taking that I've taken that I've taken that like um three times a day for the past two days okay and and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off or getting worse or To be honest, I... they're not getting any better because like I said I've been I've been vomiting literally everything I take so so I doubt that even that has had the chance to work okay and I mean it sounds like because your brothers had a similar thing it sounds like it might be some an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got which is usually caused by a virus but it can be from something you've eaten as well um if the symptoms they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts um if the symptoms are continuing to get worse the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough and sometimes you do require certain medication to help this if it's sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria and what I would say probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not sun to ease off I think it's probably important to get a stool of the stool so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment okay and and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated because if you're if you're not keeping fluid down then you can get dehydrated and How do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even like drink water I'm throwing up everything? Yeah, so you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago so you're obviously still um hydrated enough to pass urine but we um we should see you so that we can check your hydration and um get that sample sent off as soon as possible because if if you come into the clinic you can send that sample off straight away otherwise we would have to post it out to you which would take time okay so when can I come to the clinic to have this done so we can we can make you an urgent appointment and then you can you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration but if in the meantime you're feeling more unwell then we would get you seen urgently in any Okay. So you could call us back in the meantime. Okay. So while I'll do, yeah, if you could please book me the appointment and then, yeah, I'll see how I feel before the end of the day. Hopefully I don't need to go to RN. Yeah, but you keep drinking, keep going with the rehydration salts. Just tiny sips constantly. to so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and and you vomit so just tiny tiny sips but just keep going with it um and just have very simple food if you're going to have anything like toast or biscuit or something really light like that avoid um fruit vegetables uh milk anything like that which might just make it worse okay okay So you have to book an appointment through the support line yes please right okay we'll do that for you okay take care thank you thanks bye
