That's great, thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak? I am, yes. Okay, great. So how can I help you today? Um, so I kind of woke up this morning and I've just got this really horrible pain on the left side of my head. Um, a real kind of headachy feeling. Sure. Okay. And, um, uh, did the pain wake you up? Yeah, it woke me up, um, quite early this morning. What time do you wake you up? Um, Probably around 5.30-ish. And what time do you normally get up? I normally get up at about 7 o'clock. Is the headache still present now? Yes, it is. Okay. Have you had this kind of pain before? I mean, I've had a bit of a history with headaches, but nothing as severe as this before. So they were less severe. with a similar nature in terms of being one-sided and the type of pain um not so much on the one side it tends to be a bit of a cluster at the front of my head in a way um but this time it's just kind of more prominent on the left side which i've never really had it normally they kind of spread across the front of my head okay all right and um can i just go to do you have any next step mr tool uh no Okay, and do you have any fever? No. All right. How are you with bright lights at the moment? Do you feel sensitive to bright lights? Can you tolerate them more? Okay. I'm a little bit sensitive. It kind of makes my eyes a little bit sore, but nothing that I can't really handle. Okay. Can I just double check? Are you feeling nauseous at all? Not really. When I first got up this morning, my head felt a bit dizzy but that's kind of subsided now and that seems to be fine. Okay. Um, and um can I just double check does anyone in your family have any migraines or anything like that they've been diagnosed with migraines? Uh, no they haven't. Okay. Um, and um are you under any particular stress at the moment? Um, work's kind of um a bit stressful in the moment I've got a lot going on. and yeah, I just seem to have like a lot of kind of a backlog of work that I need to go through at the moment. So I've kind of been doing a lot of late nights as well. Right. Okay. Um, and, um, how long has that been the case for? Uh, probably about a couple of months now. How would you say your mood is? Um, I'm not like moody, I'm not angry or um, I get a bit frustrated during the day and but it kind of um ebbs and flows every now and then but yeah. Okay. Do you have, have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression or stress in the past? Um, I've had um, so I had like anxiety for about two years now and I've been on uh searchly leave for a while okay are you taking a search leave at the moment yes okay um and how do you feel in terms of anxiety at the moment do you feel anxious at the moment no not necessarily at work sometimes I do feel a bit anxious um I kind of just the panic of not being able to get my work done on time um but other than that i i don't feel um massively anxious all right um now so i just need to ask this for anyone suffering with this have you have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself no um now with regards to this headache is it worse when you lie down or um is is it better when you lie down um when i lay down like uh it kind of feels a little bit sore at first um and it takes me a while to get comfortable um so yeah at the beginning it does but then again that just kind of um soothes a little bit okay um so would you say ultimately it's better when you lie down or you know yeah i would say so okay um and um in terms of um this headache since this morning have you taken anything for it yet? I've taken some paracetamol. Does that help? Not really, no. Okay, are you taking anything else at all? No, that's it. Just paracetamol. Okay. Do you have any other illnesses at all? None. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure? No. Have you ever had your blood pressure checked? No. Okay. And are there any illnesses in your family? No, there's nothing. My parents, my mom had a history of anxiety as well, but no kind of like physical illnesses or anything like that. Okay, cool. And are you on any medication? No, other than Sertaline and having taken this morning and nothing else do you have any allergies to any medication not that i'm aware of no and are you living by yourself at the moment or you live with someone else um i live with my partner okay are you a smoker no okay and uh do you have any pets at home uh i have a cat okay And can I just tell you, how much exercise would you do normally a week? So normally I try to go running at least three times a week. Okay. And what's your goal at like? It's okay. It's nothing, it's nothing really healthy. It's fine. Okay. It's unhealthy. Now, in terms of this headache, Obviously, I haven't been able to examine you see you directly but um it sounds like it might be one of two things it could be an element of what we call tension headache okay that's one possibility um and what makes that more likely is the fact that you've been under some pressure and you have a history of anxiety in the past okay the other possibility is uh migraine as well okay um and the fact what makes that more likely is the fact it's on one side and that you've got some sensitivity to light okay okay so what what i think we can do is um i think we can give you some um generic pain relief that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches okay so i'll tell you this in a second and the other thing that i was going to suggest is we maybe look explore things to try and decrease the stress from work so okay um the medication wise the things that would start off first line if someone had migraine was to would be to start ibuprofen and okay uh that the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses of ibuprofen so that's one thing we can start you can keep on taking paracetamol if you like but the ibuprofen is um actually more effective for migraine and all right um yeah so the guidelines have changed recently we before that we used to give paracetamol first line but now it's I'm over-penicillin aspirin that's okay um the other thing I'd like you to do is maybe consider taking some time off work okay because if that's due to stress from work um maybe having a week off if you self-certify that might help with things and I'd also like you to explore counseling options as well so there's a counseling service in your area that I can give you the name for you to self refer i'd like yeah that okay i'd like to try that um what we're gonna do is we'll have a follow-up in a week's time as well as those two things other things i'd like you to do is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of seven eight hours sleep a night every night okay a minimum of um one point five to two liters of water or fluids a day and that's not including coffee or tea Okay. All right because sometimes dehydration and you know fatigue can be caused of headaches as well um uh i didn't realize that yeah so that that is um you know we need to rule those things out um let's let's try that okay um let's have a follow-up appointment if we're finding that things are not getting better we might need to arrange some blood tests or um look at other possibilities but we'll try that in the first instance um if anything changes in the meantime or you get worried or things get worse feel free have a low threshold for ringing us back and booking an appointment and we can reassess the situation okay yeah that that sounds brilliant thank you so much for your help okay no problem so there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes and I'll also leave a link to some of the danger signs and symptoms of headaches in the notes if you can read through that in your own time that will just help you to have a bit more control over what's going on and understanding of what kind of things should trigger you contacting another doctor okay that's perfect thank you so much for how no problem okay so we'll we'll touch base in a week's time with me or myself or one of the other doctors and we could we'll take it from there okay okay thank you yeah i'll put an appointment in um yeah in that time brilliant okay all right take it thank you auntie bye-bye
