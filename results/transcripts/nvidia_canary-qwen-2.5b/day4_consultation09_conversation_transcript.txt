Okay, Daniel. And are you in a comfortable and confidential place to talk? Yeah, totally. Happy to go ahead. Great, how can I help? Yeah, I just my chest has been feeling really tight. Okay. And how long has this been going for, Daniel? For about three hours now. Okay. And so tight chest for three hours. And so you were born in 1992, so it makes you 26. 26, yeah. and you uh any shortness of breath at all like that yeah like a little bit um yeah a little bit short of breath not too bad uh any cough wheeze yeah i'm feeling a bit wheezy as well because of the coughing coughing yeah yeah sore throat runny nose sore ears You know, I had a cold last week and it's not as bad as it was but yeah I had a sore throat I had a runny nose just feeling under the weather you feeling better now on the tight chest I mean I feel worse but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore right okay okay but you know now you've got this this and so you've still got still got uh symptoms of a cold essentially yeah the cough's kind of stuck around. Yeah, okay. Are you coughing up anything? Uh, no. And, um, do you have any other medical problems like asthma? Yeah, yeah, I have asthma. I've had it for a while now. Um, and then I have like a hay fever, you know, some allergies. okay do you have any inhalers or any any medications um yeah so uh you know the um uh ventolin it's called uh salbutamol yeah i got that one and then i have a steroid uh clenil clenil inhaler yeah okay yeah yeah and um Have you been using clonal and the ventolin and how often you've been using them um well to be honest i was away at uni last week and i forgot to bring it with me so i haven't really in the past week because it because i'm sorry they ran out and i i forgot to go and grab the next one yeah sure about a week ago okay All right. All right. So, so, so you, you haven't got any Tinnel or any Ventolin at the moment? Not with me right now. No, I ran out. Okay. Right. Um, and, and any drug allergies, you know, no, no, not allergic to anything. Just like, just the dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs. Okay, great. Now, uh, do you, anyone in your family have any medical problems? you know problems? Yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Oh, when I was young, I also had eczema and I had a milk protein allergy when I was young too. Okay. Right, so just do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or hopes for this consultation? Not really. Like I feel like asthma is probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers wouldn't be helpful. It's just kind of scary because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight in a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I can imagine. it certainly sounds like yeah if you've had this cold you've got wheezy with a cough um and it's non-productive cough and you're sure is the cough worse at night time I mean it gets a little bit worse at night but basically just pretty consistent yeah it hasn't gone away And you've got this tight chest, but you wouldn't say you've got chest pain, there's more a tight chest, is that? No, not really pain, it's more like tight, it just feels like sometimes you can't get a full breath in, you know? Yeah, sure. Okay, well, I would quite like to certainly get you some Ventolin, clonal modulate. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit more like back in high school. But I've been pretty good at taking my inhalers, so not so much anymore. Have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient, as in you know, stayed in there overnight for asthma? Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube with my throat. Oh, okay. So you went to hospital and had a So you stayed in hospital for a few days did you with an asthma exacerbation? Yeah, I did yeah Okay, but currently you're just on Ventolin and Clonal and you haven't got any of those drugs those inhibitors I'd be pretty good I'd be pretty good just on the Clonal and the salbutamol. Okay When sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation? I think I was like 17 16 maybe okay um just to quantify how short of breath you are um i don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you no you won't have are you able to like walk up flight of stairs okay walk on the flat okay without getting too short breath or are you short of breath at rest? I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like except for that feeling I was describing. It does when I'm walking upstairs, I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be. Sure. Yeah, okay, but you're not short of breath at rest at the moment. No, no, no, I'm not. Okay, fine. So what I think, and just to go over it, is there anything you'd hoped other than the, uh, a prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting from this? Well, I just want to know that I'm okay. So just like keep, I just don't want to have to get, um, that, that intervention again. Sure. Yeah. No. Absolutely. Okay. Well, I'm really glad you've swog talked to me today. I think what we can do is, is give you a prescription for, uh, some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you. within the hour I would hope and I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids so this is these are tablets which you can take for five days two tablets in the morning and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response okay Now there are some side effects to the steroids which I should really tell you about but please read the label that's associated with it. Don't be too worried about the side effects. They're uncommon. Most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated. And you probably have you had them in the past, do you know? Sorry, sorry. You were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Have you had steroids in the past? I can't remember. Probably. Probably. Yeah, I would like to believe that. So they can come, they can make you, your mood change, can be slightly low or too, slightly high, can give you a high blood sugar, um, and, uh, that, uh, they can also cause rational, yeah, um, headaches, but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help your anxiety a lot. What I'd like to do is send you these, the some prescriptions for your inhalers are ongoing so you can once you get better from this asthma attack you can you can use the clonal modulate in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN but so Ventolin when you need to when you're getting worse. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than every three hours at any time. It's a good idea to seek medical attention. So see a doctor in some capacity. And the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Have you, do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before? Yeah, yeah. Somebody taught me how to use it a while ago. I don't, I don't really use it to be honest, but have you got one? I Think I do I have one somewhere. Okay. All right. Well, um, I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it But essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside breathing in and out um uh for five five or ten breaths Okay, and yeah, so Was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage? I think you got me covered. Okay. And, and, uh, it might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but, uh, I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're okay with that. All right. righty. Well, thank you very much. No worries. Any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath, um, or just generally concerning symptoms, uh, pain in your chest, tightness, uh, feeling lightheaded, uh, then seek further medical attention and, you know, please. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
