Tell me more about your skin firstly. You mentioned it's been dry and itchy. Where are baths on your skin? All over my arms and my hands mainly. Okay. And is this something you've had before? I know. So did it come about quite suddenly or was it more kind of a gradual thing? I think I saw it a few days ago. Okay. And has it spread anywhere else? Has it spread to your chest, your legs, your face?

And in what way has work been stressful? I think the kids have been really annoying these days. Okay. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. And I hope it gets better. Going back to your skin, is it anything you've done perhaps, which may have triggered your symptoms, anything you've touched, or, you know, for example, shower gel, soaps, fabric cleaners? I went swimming a few days ago. Okay. Is that the first time in your life, or have you been before? And now I've been before. Okay. And did your symptoms start after you went swimming? Yes, okay, all right. You mentioned you've had no other fevers, is that right? No fevers, no vomiting? No. No, how's your health otherwise? It's pretty good, yeah, I'm not on any medication. We'll get to medication in just a second. Do you feel generally run down? Do you feel tired? Uh, yeah, I think I have been quite tired. Okay. Are you eating and drinking okay?

No. Okay, and your water works are all okay, you pass the urine okay?

I know okay, it's a contraceptive pill Does that make sense? Is that something you... Does that ring a bell now? Oh yeah. Okay. Is it any other medications that you take? Oh no. No. So in terms of your medication, there's no problems of skin problems in the past, things like eczema or dermatitis. No. I think it might just be the weather. Sorry, what was that?

And you said you meant you work as a primary school teacher? Yeah, that's right. The reason i asked is sometimes stress can be a contrib contributing factor um you felt you noticed yourself find your life be more stressful recently all right do you feel now might have any correlations your symptoms i mean i don't i don't think so okay all right um fine um Okay, well, normally at this stage I to proceed to examination, but based on your story, it's difficult. I think, you know, you've essentially the story is you've got a dry itchy rash on your main in your hands you mentioned, and your arms, which started perhaps after swimming a few days ago. But no other symptoms you're feeling otherwise? Well, no fevers, no bleeding or discharge from skin i wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis um have you heard of that condition before i have yeah okay um great well i can give you a patient information leaflet about that which gives a bit more information about the disease but um it's something that we can readily treat it um with a couple of options we have steroid creams i can give you which will help with the inflammation and something called emollients which can help with the dry dry skin and that's something you just need to kind of paste on onto your skin throughout the day for the next few days and hopefully that helps your symptoms. Okay cool thank you very much. You can also try antihistamines so you can get things over the counter piritan loratadine that can sometimes help with the itchiness yeah that sounds good okay and um that's probably what i recommend parasitic on this occasion wouldn't be helpful um uh painkillers wouldn't be helpful on this occasion but let's let's let's see how the next few days go and if it's still not getting better so come back and see me next week and we can have a look again at your symptoms. Okay perfect thank you very much. Do you have any questions for me? I know. Okay well wish you all the best have a good day. Oh thank you very much.
