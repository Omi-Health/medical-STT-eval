You also mentioned that you can walk, but you're not walking straight. Why is that? Is it because I think just because the room feels like it's moving a bit? It feels like the room.

So this is like just symptomatic relief like if you have a fever we just give paracetamol so just to you know make you able to come and see one of the doctors and things like that.

Okay. But if not, wait for the appointment for the doctor to examine you. and we'll take it from there. So I'll send a prescription across to your pharmacy. It looks like it's the Lloyd Pharmacy on our system. Is that correct? Yeah. Yeah. So we'll send you across that prescription. It's called Phenito. Yeah. It's one tablet three times a day.
