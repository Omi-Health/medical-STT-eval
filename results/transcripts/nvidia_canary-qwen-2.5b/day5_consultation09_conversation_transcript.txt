Can I do for you? And it coming, I don't really know what's been going on, but it's just aching all over. But definitely the last six weeks, it might have been slightly longer than that, but it's just sort of that feeling really tired or down. Okay. And so when do you think you were last well? Where are now? We just started April. Definitely Christmas New Year. I felt relatively well, I think. Um, so since then, actually, yeah, I I was on holiday in um, in the States and Yeah, it probably coincided with some time around then end of January started for. Babe, do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back? Probably a couple of weeks after I got back. Were you well when you were on holiday? Yeah, I had a great time, very active. Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhea, vomiting, anything like that? No, not that. I recall. Yeah, not. No, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards. Okay, so just tell me what symptoms you've been having in terms of just your general health, any persistent cold symptoms or earaches, sore throat, chest, cough, shortness of breath, phlegm, anything like that? No. Any change in your weight before? I don't think so I'm probably less hungry but no no weight change just a bit are you eating different amounts yeah probably slightly smaller portions or it yeah more of an effort to actually eat everything that's in front of me any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat or abdominal pain no Any change in your bowel habit diarrhea vomiting or blood in the stool and no any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine no that's all fine okay and any other general symptoms like rashes or I don't have any rashes now okay what uh if I've got a photo um on my phone if that's helpful I can try and show you hang on and because this yeah this was weird this sort of came up and then uh disappeared after a couple of weeks that was the light that I can see that yeah whereabouts was it uh I think sort of calf back of my calf because I didn't notice it my wife noticed it actually when do you first notice it? Probably around the end of February, the middle to end of Feb. And then it, like it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time and I, it faded over a couple of weeks I guess. Did you have any fevers at that time? To be honest, that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat I had um so possibly a little bit feverish but I I sort of put it down to that Do you know where you got that when it started? Did you be walking? Did you get any bites that you noticed? I definitely like I do quite a lot of walking and we did um quite a lot while we were out in the on holiday as well but definitely um Yeah, I mean, i don't recall any part i don't remember seeing anything fitting but you're often like yeah as you're walking through i was in shorts and boots right you feel the outfit whereabouts where you in the states um just sort of uh near you samantha okay and any headaches blood vision tingling numbness um No. So it's of a headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy. Oh, it's better. It's better. And have you been able to go to work as usual? I've been going to work. I don't know how effective it's been, but yeah. What's your job? I work for a health technology company, actually. Okay, and has your concentration been affected or your tiredness levels in the daytime at work? Yeah definitely sort of tired and yeah less energy. I think I would normally be. Have you been able to exercise okay? Not as much. I don't know if it's I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it. I'm not exercising as much as I would normally. Okay. And how's your mental health, your stress levels? Pretty good at the moment actually. Like previously that has been an issue but other than sort of physically feeling a bit crappy, I'm Yeah, in a pretty good place okay apart from that rash any other rushes on your skin or swelling of your joints or pain in your joints uh yeah sort of aching shoulders back the hips knees but sort of yeah not that it's swelling that you've noticed no what happens wrists ankles toes uh no Okay. And any other significant medical problems in the past uh i mean a people do i know but then asthma and hay fever okay any flower so you've got asthma recently uh done pretty well bro do you take the regular inhalers or other medication Yeah, I've got one of those and then then preventative yeah uh to take twice a day but i've not used my you haven't been used yet so i i have i've been using the every day for the morning and night but not the uh how people are not okay and any um do you take any other medications um i think um one of the anti-cancer drugs found in of the it might be there's a thing can I get that from just from the bottom yeah it's fine and do you smoke drinking the alcohol Sorry occasionally that was okay and who do you live with at home? Just my wife. Sorry. So with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, that's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels. um i think it's important to get some blood tests checking all the normal things like liver kidneys blood count etc but also some more specific things like um bacterial infection you can sometimes get including one that you can get which can produce a rash like that so that would involve blood tests are you happy to do that Yeah, I'm generally happy with that. What's the infection? Well, you can get bacterial infection caused, it's called Lyme disease, that you can get a rash of that from a tick bite. So that's something we would do a test for as well. Okay, and if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it. So it's definitely worth checking for but we would also check just for other things which can cause reduced energy, tiredness and aching for persistent over six weeks. Okay. So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line and then when you've had the test, the range of follow-up about a week after after you've had the test. Okay, so do the test first and then and that follow-up we can just do over the phone again yeah yeah we can do that over the phone to start with excellent okay that's really helpful thank you very much oh sorry he broke up a bit there any other questions oh no not no okay that's great take care thank you thank you
