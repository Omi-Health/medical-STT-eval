Um, I don't think there's a lot to worry about. I think you probably have, you know, a bit of a viral, what we say, viral illness, and maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection, or maybe early signs of a flu. um it normally lasts for about seven to ten days and just gets better really um over But things you can do to really help yourself is get plenty of rest. I'd probably advise you taking a day or two of work if you can. Making yourself you know pushing fluids and make yourself well hydrated. Continuing with the regular paracetamol and ibuprofen and we should see how things go really. If next week you're still not better I want you to come back and see me um is that clear is that does that make does that make yeah that's that's that's all good it makes sense uh i think i thought i'll take a couple days off yeah and things to look out for if you're really not getting better if you if you have a high fever or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored or chest pain i'd like you to come back and see me much sooner give me a call um and we can help you out say yeah i'm just that uh i'll uh i'll take care great have a great day good luck with your work thank you
