And who do you live with at home? Sorry? Who do you live with at home? My partner. And what's your job today? I'm a designer. Have you had to miss any work at all? No, but I don't feel that I'm finding it really hard to do any of my work or normal things. Okay. And do you smoke at all normally no i don't do you drink any alcohol regularly no um and any other drugs no no okay um i mean the fact that you haven't had headaches before um is unusual the fact that they developed is there anything you think's changed when you increase stress change in your diet or lifestyle not that I can not that I can think of okay so what we would suggest is trying a site from the pain relief and so similar to ibuprofen but taking it instead of ibuprofen not at the same time and taking that regularly with food and hopefully that will settle it down you can take paracetamol along with that try and take rest have lots of good hydration. But if the pain's getting worse or you get new symptoms, fever, rash, vomiting, neck stiffness, or you keep getting episodes of the same type of thing, then we need to speak to you and make a plan for what we can do next. Okay. Thank you. Any other questions? How long do you think it will last for well i should think it should pull down if it's getting worse or not settling in the next day or two then certainly give us a call back if when you've tried the medication that i've prescribed from the pharmacy okay okay thank you all right then thanks a lot bye
