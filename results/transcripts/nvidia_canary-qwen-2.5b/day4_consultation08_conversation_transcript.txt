Hello? Hi, hi there. My name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors at Babello. I just, can I confirm your name please? Yeah, my name is Brian. So, what, so your name was, name was Brian. Brian, hi Brian. Hi Brian. And your date of birth. Yeah, my date of birth is the 8th of august 1982. great and uh are you in a sort of uh confidential place where you can speak freely yeah no no one else can hear me great and you're happy to continue the consultation yes marvelous okay so um how can i help today yeah um so basically it's just been happening over the last few weeks or so. I don't really feel like, um, like getting up in the morning is really difficult and I don't have much energy at all during the day. Um, often, yeah, just like doing most things that I would normally find easy, uh, has become quite difficult. Okay, so things have become quite difficult for you. Yeah. Is there anything else? Um, it's quite hard to say, like, things like I'm not eating very much at the moment, so I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy. Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. Um, so you've had difficulty waking up, no energy, not eating. And that's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks, do you mean two or three or five? Now I think about it, maybe, maybe even longer. I guess it might be related to this. So I also started a new job slightly recently. It might have even coincided with that job a couple of months ago. When did you start your new job two months ago you say yeah okay and um so this has been going on perhaps for um sort of six weeks or so more like two two months i would say yeah okay all right so um Is there anything that you're particularly sort of concerned about um or hoping to get out of this consultation? Well um I I know that it's not really normal for me so before this phase started happening you know I wouldn't have uh any problems sort of eating what I want to eat or you know doing standard things in life and and what I want to do is to like kind of return to that previous state uh somehow um I'm not sure how that is uh what what the best ways of doing that are but yeah give some advice or whatever that'd be really useful okay sure okay um Well, what I'd like to do is just ask you a few more sort of questions around what's been going on and also around your background health and things like that. And then we can go on sort of what can be done from there is that right okay okay great so you say you've been um feeling unwell with not a lot of energy difficult waking up in the mornings do you tend to just on that do you tend to wake up early and then stay in bed in the morning um actually i'm just uh not not really weight you know fairly it's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all probably I think that's probably close. There's difficulty sleeping as well Yeah, and have you and How has your mood been over this period? Have you been feeling restructured I'd say I kind of Yeah, finding it really hard to quite difficulty focusing I would say not unhappy or happy but just quite just not focused okay so difficulty focusing quite distracted and would you say you've been in good spirits or is your mood low um actually uh now you you mentioned it like my mood is a bit lower recently um and so i just like uh my sex drive has kind of decreased um a bit over the the past few months as well so yeah okay and uh so Lower mood, decreased sex drive recently as well. And just on that note, there's a few questions around that. Are you able to, maybe slightly personal questions, but if you're okay to answer this, do you tend to have morning erections like you? Is that something that you've noticed? I haven't noticed anything like that specifically. So you've not, so you're saying you have not noticed morning directions and usually you would so it's a normal thing to have waking up with something but you have not noticed those recently I have not noticed those recently okay so and that's been a change is it important one I don't think sorry yeah no I don't think it's important to change no I so you don't think there's been a change there? No, there hasn't been a change there. Okay, sorry, right, sorry. Okay, so just going back to the mood symptoms as well. When you've had difficulty focusing, easily distracted, your mood has been slightly lower with lower sex drive. Yeah. And in what way is your sex drive been lower? Are you in a relationship at the moment? Yeah, I I'm married. Um, I've been married for many years. And yeah, just um, over the last few months, just uh, in this interest. This interested. Okay, sorry you phrased that for a moment. So less interested as well okay and just to ask you a few questions before we uh care it uh wrap up is uh any significant past medical history um so do you suffer from any uh mental health problems in the past or any uh physical health problems no um so in the past um i have a history of hyper thyroidism uh hyper thyroidism I have a thyroid yeah okay so that's um I thyroid just to sort of confirm it sorry can you say that again please hyper as in high hyper thyroid hypo okay hyper thyroid thank you thank you um yeah and uh also in the past i mean i haven't had any kind of specific uh medical diagnoses along these lines um but the suspicion that it may have had an impact on me but my father has committed suicide um about 15 years ago okay um, uh, do you take any medications? I have a drug history of thyroxine. So maybe, yes. Do you continue to take thyroxine now? Yes, you do. So you're taking thyroid at the moment. Yes, cool. Any drug allergies? Are you allergic to any medications? No, I have never had any medication allergies. No allergies. And you mentioned the suicide of your father 15 years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other... significant family history of medical conditions or psychiatric conditions? No. No depression or anything like that running in the family or... Nothing, nothing, that's all. Okay. And your mother is as well, any brothers or sisters? Yeah, she's fine. And I'm an any child. Okay. So I just, so it sorry, my slightly random question, but any, uh, change in your vision? No, no, I think like that. Okay, and just to go back to you, you're saying you had low mood. Some people who do have low mood and low sex drive can sometimes feel suicidal as well. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else? No, no. No, not really. No. And are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities that you have done in the past? Sometimes, I mean, I guess most of the activities, but when I've been doing sports as well, I find sometimes it's quite difficult to breathe. So I have some kind of like shortness of breath when doing... sports compared to maybe a couple of months ago. Okay, so you've become more short of breath over the last few months. Yeah. And you've had, okay, so any other things around that? So you've more fatigue, more shortness of breath over the last few months. um with a lower lower mood decrease sex drive um is there just before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like to talk about? No, nothing specific. So, getting a little bit towards the end now, but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you. I would like to... probably see you in person and do an examination and and also we'd probably like to do some blood tests um as well so do you think it'd be possible to see uh to book an appointment in the next few days uh with your gp or um that would be ideal i think here um and then we can yes we could probably do some more uh we'll do an examination and do some investigations really to see what's going on here a little bit more That makes sense yeah is that right yeah that's very useful thank you um okay that's it so you have some kind of plan um yeah yeah yeah i think we i definitely think we need a plan here um it's been nice talking to you i'm sorry we're out of time now uh but we've at least started the ball rolling with um some further investigations and tests i'm glad you're you know you you'll you although you have a low mood um you're not feeling suicidal just to confirm that and you're uh and uh we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some of your tiredness and your other symptoms when we see you okay thank you very much for taking the time okay thank you thanks
