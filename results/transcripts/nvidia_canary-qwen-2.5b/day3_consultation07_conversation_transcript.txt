I had noticed my skin is sore and red Okay, so where is it sore and red? It's all over my chest my hands and arms especially inside of the elbows and On the inside of the elbows, yeah Which is the worst here which is the the worst area all right the worst area is it very itchy it's very itchy and dry all over my body itchy and dry okay have you had something like this in the past yes uh yes i have it i have eczema in my path okay do you think this is similar to your usual eczema or is it worse I think it's yeah it's gotten worse like these past few days. Yeah, but it could be like something similar. So on the skin, is there any you know any of the patches of sore area? You mentioned it's quite sore. Is it weeping? Is it like watery liquid coming from that area? Weeping? No. Nothing that you notice. Okay, right. The area that are cracked. Yeah, so you have cracks over there. Okay. And is there any scratch marks on your on any of the you know areas any scratch marks I mean it's very easy to scratch myself but no scratch marks okay is there any thickened skin like you know where it's the skin's very thick and darkened areas no no I don't think I don't think so okay All right here. So you've mentioned you've got a history of eczema. So what do you do about it? How do you keep it under control? Yeah, usually I use a cream called Diprobase. In the shower I use something called Dermal. Dermal, all right. And have you been using them recently or not? Yes, yes, I use them. Use them every day? Yes, I there's no change in that. I didn't change anything. Okay. Have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema? Um, I'm not sure. Ah, yes. Yes, I've used steroids. But it's not helping. Yeah, also you're still using the steroids yeah i tried i tried which one are you using the steroids what's the name i'm not sure it's uh is it the bump is not there okay so is it like the all over the counter ones sorry all over the counter hydrocortisone that does that bring up yeah so you're using the hydrocortisone yeah Are you using any antihistamines at all? Uh, no, no, no antihistamines, okay? Right, fine. Otherwise, other than there's rash, you're feeling well in yourselves, there's no temperature, no joint pains, yeah? No joint pains, no. But I've tried those antihistamines and it didn't work. You've tried the antihistamines and it didn't work. Okay, which one did you try the one over the counter okay so like said Trasen yeah yeah okay that's fine right okay so from what you're describing it looks like you know it is quite widespread your eczema yeah because you're having it all over your chest and hands and things like that So do you have any allergies to any medication at all? No, no allergies. No allergies. Okay. And you don't, other than eczema, you don't have any other medical condition? I have asthma. And in my family, there's hypothyroidism and migraine. My mother has migraine. Mother has my grain and what was the other one I didn't understand? I put David. Who has hypothyroidism? My mother. Okay, so she has hypothyroidism. Okay, that's fine. Right, you mentioned you have asthma. So what medications are you using for asthma? Um, uh, you know, probably Nader. The blue inhaler, so you don't, you don't use it every day, so you just use it on and off. Yeah Yeah, yeah blue inhalers, but your breathing's all okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's only when I have a flare up So what we need to do is obviously you've got extent as I've mentioned so extensive eczema What we'll do need a couple of things because to keep you a bit comfortable will you would probably need some histamines which I'm going to prescribe Also, hydrocortisone is a baby steroids that you use for young children you might probably need a bit more stronger one like betnawate or something like that okay so we'll try that first so i'm going to be it's called the antihistamine it's called fexfenadine and then you'll try with some betnawate first so it's like very small amount like it's like one fingertip yeah this much is is enough to cover your palms and your back of your hands yeah so it's very small amount so that if you can imagine you can cover with a very small amount the whole body yeah so use that you have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks okay okay if if there's no improvement you need to get back to us or if you have any kind of adverse reaction like an allergic reaction which is unlikely but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us okay okay thank you very much so what we're going to do is we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy it looks like boots on the systems is that correct yeah yes yes so i'll send it across to boots and it won't be there for collect collecting If things are getting worse in the next two weeks call us beforehand otherwise wait for two weeks take the medication and the cream you still need to continue on your emollients like the dermo soap and as well as the diprobase yeah so you still need to use those in the interim any questions at all no no questions thank you you take care then bye bye now bye
