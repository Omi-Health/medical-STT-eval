Hello Good morning Kim How can I help you this morning? So I'm some some pain in my tummy like the lower part of my tummy okay and I'm just being quite hot and sweaty right I'm sorry to hear that when when did your symptoms all start about two days ago okay and where about in the tummy is the pain exactly uh like below my belly button it's i quite sore when i press on it okay did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual It hasn't been it's more gradual and it's just it's getting a bit worse now okay okay and can you describe the pain to me uh it's kind of like a I guess a burning pain uh and it's just right there in that spot like that's mostly where I'm feeling it it hasn't spread anywhere else just just below your belly button you were mentioned yeah okay um and is the pain constant or does it come and go It's pretty constant. It's like getting worse. It's not like I can still move and walk around. I mean, I'm still kind of functioning. It's just I'm aware of it all the time. Okay. And with the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms at all? So, for example, let's focus first on your bowels. Are your bowels working okay? Yeah, I had a bit of constipation, but that's better now. That was like since last week. okay so you've got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose stools no my bowel movements are normal now okay and what about your water works are you passing urine okay yeah i'm fine that's fine that's i did notice that i was a little the urine was a little pink in color but i haven't like it hasn't really been burning specifically or hurting when i pee and uh And I did notice I was going to the I was peeing more regularly but I have been drinking lots of fluids so I wasn't sure um I wasn't sure um like you know if that was related to the pain and when you mentioned pink urine do you was there any blood at all in your urine or is it difficult to say I can't say I mean maybe Okay, all right, but otherwise it doesn't hurt or sting when you pass urine and i haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that um just that i'm peeing more than off more regularly okay um okay and um moving up to us uh other symptoms have you noticed any vomiting or fitting nausea tool just a little nausea um but no vomiting any temperatures or fevers I haven't really, I felt a bit hot and sweaty, but I haven't really measured it. So I can't really say. Okay. Sorry. Um, and Kim, just to be able to ask, um, uh, you know, all female patients, it's just questions about your cycle, if you don't mind me asking. Um, are you currently, um, are you currently sexually active? Yeah, I've had the same partner. I am we were last sexually active about four days ago. Uh, my last STD screen was normal, which was about six months ago. Okay. So you've had no other partner since then? No other partner since then. Okay. Um, uh, and do you use any contraception tool? I'm on the implant on I had the implant on inserted about a year ago. Okay, fine. Um, are you still having periods? Yes. When was your last period? My last period was about three weeks ago. I mean, two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, okay. So is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implant and is there any chance you could attempt to be pregnant? It's not the first thing to think about. We don't use any other barrier method, so we just use the, I just have the implant on and the same partner. Theoretically, if the implant has been working then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect okay, well something to think about them Maybe we'll have to do a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that Okay, and and so just to summarize so far if you don't mind it's really for a couple of days is telling me pain that's really affected you many lower down towards your belly button it's quite burning you said it's getting worse um you notice some pink urine urine, but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine. And your bowels are working okay. You felt a little nauseous and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right? Yeah, that sounds very accurate. Is there anything else perhaps you feel like you should share with me at this stage, which you think might be important? I don't think so. I think we've covered everything. That's really bothering me. Yeah, okay. Tell me a bit more about your um medical history otherwise are you normally fitting well yeah quite well I haven't had any surgical I don't have any surgical history I don't have any previous I haven't had any operations before or and I'm not on any other medication I just had the implant okay um you had anything like this before in the past any similar symptoms? I've never had these symptoms before. No, okay. Fine. And you have a family history, I should be aware of anything relevant, family related to the bowels, maybe related to the guiding history. No, not that I'm aware of. Okay, all right. And socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? i live in a share house and with two other two other roommates okay um and uh are you currently working yeah i currently i am currently what do you do for work i am an accountant okay um great okay um do you smoke it all No, no, and do you drink much in the way of alcohol? I was socially I drink but I don't think more more than normal. Okay. Just before I go to examination I just want to go through just some few screening questions that's okay yes or no. We've covered majority of them already but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else um how's your how's your chest how's your breathing um if you feel short of breath or i'm not having any problems or i don't have a cough or anything that's wearing me okay any uh funny heartbeats or rhythms palpitations not that no okay any headaches any problems with your vision No, no, okay, all right um fine okay um so really just um moving on um so based based on your story really uh kim it's it's a it's difficult one it's it's um we know you've got some primary pain we don't exactly know what's causing it could be a few different things that could be causing your pain Could this be a, you know, could this be a urine infection, for example? Could this be something related to your gut um could this be something related to your you know a pregnancy related cause um and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out um what's going on here um which I can organise for you today okay um And based on those tests, we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed. But certainly, if it's been going on for the last couple of days, you know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for maybe a urinary infection. And so with some antibiotics. Can we do that instead of me going for tests and then seeing how that goes? Yeah, absolutely. So I think it's certainly worth... you know, covering you with some antiparasites today. But I still want you to bear in mind you know having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here and um and i want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time if your symptoms are not getting better or indeed if they're getting worse so things to look out for would be you know worse than tummy pain um if you're feeling really hot and sweaty the temperature's not coming down um vomiting etc does that make sense yeah i think i'm happy with that plan okay um you can try just regular painkillers uh paracetamol that will be advisable um make sure you drink plenty of fluids you can try some cranberry juice as well which can sometimes help with your urine symptoms um take the antibiotics and give me a call you know if you are worried about anything else Sure, that sounds great. Thank you very much. Should I just collect the script at my pharmacy? Yeah, but I'll send it straight to your pharmacy. Start the antibiotics today. Something called trimethoprine. We'll take two tablets, one tablet twice a day for three days. Okay, that sounds great. Let's hear you guess on. Okay, thank you very much. Great, all the best. Right? No way.
