I kind of feel like it's hard. I kind of lose my appetite also. One thing that's kind of weird is I sometimes also get like some tingling in my arms. Okay. Yeah. And like especially for example when I come into the elevator in the morning. Okay. i kind of have my heart is beating kind of fast okay so those are lots of things are they all happening at the same time oh no it's randomly like yeah it's it's it's a different times and do they all happen at the same time or is it one thing one time and one time roughly one time thing at the time okay so let's with the headaches when they do come do you have any idea the headache is going to come? Uh, not really, but generally during work times. So it's normally at work. I'm with work, I'm in a meeting or I'm on my laptop. Okay, and where does the headache sit in your head? Is it the front or the back? Um, I can't say. So like, you kind of lower. Okay. And don't make me where else huh does it go anywhere else the headache no it's mostly in the front and then yeah it's kind of stays there and when you have the headache specifically do you get sick Not really, but it's like making it hard. Yeah, I kind of feel a little bit nauseous maybe. Okay. And sometimes I also feel like, yeah, it's like maybe probably breathing or something. Okay. And do you normally get headaches before all of this started? So. No, I feel like my health situation was mostly under control. Okay. Yeah. And then let's sort of start it roughly when I changed jobs. Okay. So talk to me about your job. What do you do? I'm a lawyer. And do you work in London at the moment? Yes. So do you get these headaches on your commute into work? Not really. I get it mostly when I'm at work. Okay, and tell me about what you do. Do you sit in front of a computer most of the time or do you speak to people like 50-50 go to meetings and then sit in front of a computer? Okay, just not up breathing. And these things have happened mostly when you're sitting at your computer. Yeah, it happens then, yeah. Okay, and tell me, what did you do before being a lawyer? No, I was a lawyer at a previous job as well. Okay. So talk to me about the stress that you're under at the moment. If 10 out of 10 is extremely stressful and 1 out of 10 is being on vacation, where are you at the moment? I think it's seven or eight. And is that normal for you? Yeah, it's like a law firm. Like there's always pressure. Okay. So you mentioned your headaches. You also mentioned your reduced appetite. So you don't want to eat as much. Yeah. Have you lost weight? Yes. Can you remember how much you've lost? Five pounds. And is that because you're going to the gym or is that unintentional? It's not intentional, no. Okay. So have you noticed your clothes feeling looser? Not really. Ah, no. And have people said or commented that you've lost weight? No. Great. And another thing that you also mentioned is that you notice tingling in your hand. Yeah. So talk to me about that. Is it in one hand or both hands? Both. And do you get that in your legs as well? No. And what does it feel like, the tingling? Prickling. Yeah. And again, is this the first time you've noticed this? Yeah. Okay. And the other two things that I've just jotted down is you're feeling hot, but you didn't mention that. Is that correct? No. But like, I would say like, I guess it's like feeling of short, like short of breath. Okay. Sometimes. So like that could be what you were referring to. Yes. So do you feel short of breath while you're sitting at your desk? Yeah. No? Yes? Sorry. Yeah. Okay. And how about when you're exercising? No, okay, and the last thing is you mentioned that you noticed your heart beating Yeah, again, how often do you get that? I I would like it's maybe once a day maybe more There's one more thing that I think I should mention like I do have like some loss of libido at home okay how long has that been happening for same amount of time really like since i changed my job fine and apart from all of these things that you've told me do you have any other medical problems uh well i have a hypothyroidism okay And do you take medications for that? thyroxine and are you remembering to take your medications yes okay and do you drink or smoke yes how much do you drink like once a week a couple of glasses and how about smoking well and I need to ask this to all of my patients, but did you do anything else recreational in terms of drugs? Well. Okay, so you've never taken cocaine or marijuana? No. Okay, thank you. And are you allergic to anything? No. Good. So you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment, and I can understand they probably feel quite strange and unusual. Yeah. I think the best course of action is you come and see one of our doctors in the clinic. We can give you an examination. And what that means is we check your heart and your breathing. Make sure that those things are functioning correctly. And probably do some blood tests for your thyroxin. And take it from there. How does that sound? That sounds very good. Thank you. I think before we give you any medications, we should see you in person. Okay. So what we're going to do is book an appointment or I think you can book an appointment through the app to come and see us in the clinic. I'll see one of my colleagues. Yeah. I'll let them know what you've told me today so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said. Thank you. Great. Do you have any questions? No, that was it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Bye.
