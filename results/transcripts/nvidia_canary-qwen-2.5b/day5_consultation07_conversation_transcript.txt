Any pain when you take a deep breath no that's all fine have you coughed up any blood or anything like that nope and what about your nose symptoms on the front of the sinuses or anything uh nothing up in here but just constant streaming like using a million tissues and any blood coming from the nose no it's pretty green Right, okay. Any other symptoms like sore ear, sore throat? I have, I've been feeling really hot. I don't know if it's fever as such, but like to touch, I'm quite hot, but sometimes I'm feeling really chilly and needing to be under a blanket, that sort of thing. Have you checked your temperature with a thermometer? No, I haven't. Okay. And are you eating and drinking normally? Um, kind of around when it started, I had some diarrhea, but I don't know if that was associated, but since then, it's all been pretty fine. Okay. So you're drinking while holding down fluids, okay? Yeah. I'm passing water, okay? Yeah, that's fine. I'm having diarrhea now. Okay, that's fine. Um, any rushes that you've noticed? Rashes? Yeah. No, nothing like that. Me, headaches or change in your vision? No, I've had quite achy muscles, but that's pretty much it. Okay, and normally, do you have any chest problems? No. Do you ever get wheezing, short of breath? I mean, like if I do intense exercise, then yes, but not normally. And do you regularly have any infections in your chest or anything that needs treatment normally? No, a book of hypertension, so I'm on some drugs for that, but that's it really. Okay, any other medical problems? Just the hypertension and the diabetes. Okay, and what type of drugs are you on? I think something called metformin and lisinopril, I think, is the other one. Okay, when did you last have your blood pressure checked? A while ago. Do you know if it's been stable? I can't remember. Okay, and with your blood, with your diabetes, Have you had a blood test recently um yeah like yeah it was normal it was around three weeks ago okay and do you know what dose of the last antipro you're taking uh 200 Okay, have you been able to pass water normally? Any increase in frequency that you're passing water or any increased thirst uh no not particularly and has your weight been stable yeah what is your weight and height uh my height is five foot five and my weight is 65 kilograms okay and do you smoke ketchup you drink any alcohol Yes, the odd sherry. Okay. And who do you live with at home? My partner and my dog. And do you work? Yes. I'm an office manager. Okay. And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms? Something that you've brought in the chemist? quite a few lensips um it seems to be helping do you what do you mean by quite a few how many in a day do you normally take uh maybe two or three maybe like at the start of the day and at the end of the day okay have you noticed any improvement in that yeah it tends to soothe my throat a bit when i'm going to sleep okay um do you have any allergies to anything I sometimes suffer from some like hay fever and um, but it's not bad. Any allergies to any medications at all? No, I'm the one who's making. Okay, so what you described to me, it sounds like you you probably have got an infection in the chest and because it's it, you know, you're obviously getting the symptoms of your nose and your chest. It sounds like you might have a high temperature, so it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature okay i can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something yeah um most of the time these infections are caused by viruses so they do normally settle by themselves but it can take you know a week or two um and you can consistently have the cough ongoing longer than um the important thing to do would be to check your temperature um and if you feel like if the temperature is ongoing above 37.5 38 um you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down or your cough's getting worse you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out your nose and or any shorts of breast chest pain then we certainly would need to speak to you again with the diet because you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes so it's something that we do need to be careful of Okay, so then we would look at potentially antibiotics at that time perhaps? Yeah, potentially. If it's not settling or the temperature's ongoing, getting worse, then we definitely need to talk to you again. Okay. Um, have you got any other questions? Um, no, that's all fine. It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment with the lemon sip. I wouldn't take, and that's, that contains paracetamol, so don't take any other paracetamol containing products with that at the same time. The cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime. It's best for your body if you just keep coughing but if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all then it's okay to have a little bit of cough syrup just to settle that down okay cool okay do you have blood sugar checking equipment do you have not at home no Okay, well if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that all GPs ask you for. Yeah. Okay, great. All right then, take care. Thanks so much. Bye.
