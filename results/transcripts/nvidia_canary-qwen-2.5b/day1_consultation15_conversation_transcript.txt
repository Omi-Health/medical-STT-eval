All right, Laura, well, how can I help you this afternoon? Yeah, so I have soreness in my fingers and my finger like the skin on my hands is kind of cracked okay when when did this all start um a couple of months ago like three four months ago okay so it's been that long has it yeah okay and so you mentioned your is it the skin on your hands mainly that's dry yeah i haven't noticed i mean i have dryness like you know in other parts like my legs but it's not it's not very it's not severe it's just you know I've always you know I don't hydrate very much so right okay yeah like it's very it's very bad in my hands okay can I ask why have you come to see me today is it because it's got worse recently your symptoms yeah I mean it's gone to a point where where it hurts a lot and I can't really do my job so I thought I should probably get it checked out. Yeah, that sounds like a very sensible plan. Um, so which part of your hands are affected mainly? Uh, the palm. Okay, all right. Um, have you noticed any itchiness in your palms? Yeah, it's itchy. You know, all the time, but yeah, it does get itchy. Okay, any bleeding at all? I don't, don't i mean no i don't think scratching yourself be scratching yourself off turn and bleeding um yeah i guess when i've scratched it yes it has blood sometimes but yeah otherwise it had me bleed on its own okay um fine uh Okay, sorry, I'm just writing some notes as we go along. And you mentioned the skin is quite cracked as well, is that right? Yes, that's right. Okay, all right. I know it's a long time ago, but do you remember how it all started? What were you doing at the time when it all started? Is there anything you may have done to bring your symptoms on? I mean, I do work as a housekeeper. And to be honest, I'm not always very good about wearing gloves um so that could be it um i switched jobs uh four months ago okay i've been working for as a housekeeper for for a while though but um that's the only thing i can think of yeah i think that might be quite important actually i think there's definitely maybe a correlation between the two um Fine. And so you mentioned something about having general dryness is that you mentioned your legs as well yeah is that something you've you've had for a while now yeah it's not really it's not really major uh yeah it's a little bit of dryness in my legs right okay Okay, I'm just gonna ask you some very brief yes or no questions. I was like, with your symptoms, have you had any other symptoms such as fever or temperatures? No. Any nausea or any vomiting? No. Any problem with your bowels? No. And any problem with your urine or waterworks? No. Otherwise you feel well, do you in yourself? You're eating, drinking, your appetite is well maintained? Yeah, I feel good. Okay, all right. Fine. In terms of your past medical history, do you have any other conditions at all? I have diabetes. Do you know if it's type 1 or type 2? Type 2. Diabetes, okay. Anything else? No. Any skin problems? No. Eczema, dermatitis, for example. No, that I know. No, I haven't been diagnosed. No, okay. Which medications do you take? That's form in, that's form in, okay. Do you have any allergies, either to any medications or in general? Yeah. Okay. Family history wise, is there anything I should be aware of? Diabetes as well. Diabetes as well. Yeah. Okay, again, any skin problems? not that i know any history of asthma or bowel problems uh no no okay all right um fine in terms of social history you mentioned that you work as a housekeeper um and you're not always very good at wearing gloves um You recently changed jobs. Which kind of places do you work in is it mainly residential or is it commercial? It's a hotel hotel, okay? Do you think there might be a relationship between the two between the kind of the products you're using and your symptoms? Yeah, I usually use bugs for bathroom but Yeah, bedrooms and corridors not always. Okay. Have your symptoms stopped you from doing any work? Have you had to take time off work recently? Uh, yeah, like the past three days, I haven't been able to go to work. Okay. All right. Can I ask a couple of questions? Do you smoke at all? No. Do you drink much in a way of alcohol? Once a week? A couple of pints a week. A couple of pints a week. Okay, so very minimal alcohol there. Have you tried anything for your symptoms? Have you tried anything over the counter, any creams? Yeah, I've tried E45. Any luck with that? Yeah, no, I didn't really do anything. No, okay, all right. Um, and and and tease the mince and I Okay, all right. Um, Mrs. Parkington, so I think um, based on your story, I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis, which is very common in particularly people in your in your in your field who are using cleaning products not using gloves you can sometimes get a bit of a reaction between the chemicals and your skin and so moving forward there's a couple of options so firstly what we try and do is you know avoid the trigger so in your case i strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times okay in terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin we can try some steroid creams to help with the inflammation as well as some stronger emollients which you really need to kind of coat on throughout the day three four times a day for the next couple of weeks just to help with the moisturizing of your skin. If it still hasn't got better in about a week to two weeks time I really need to come back and see me again and we can maybe think about other things we can give to you. Is that all clear? uh yeah that sounds good great do you have any questions for me um where do i get the medicine from so i'll do a prescription for you now and send it over to your pharmacy okay great yeah So you said a couple of weeks it should get better, right? I think a minimum couple of weeks, 10 days to 14 days. And if it still hasn't got better, or indeed if it's getting worse, if it's spreading or the drought is getting worse come back and see me sooner okay great thank you laura thank you thank you very much bye bye now
