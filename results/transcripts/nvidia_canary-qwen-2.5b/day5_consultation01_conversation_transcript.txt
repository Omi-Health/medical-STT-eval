No no I've been feeling fine actually. and have you been eating and drinking? Okay. Yes, yes, same normal. Okay. And normally do you get any headaches? No, not really. It's not something I've ever had before. Okay. And has it occurred at a particular time in your menstrual cycle? No, not particularly. My period was about a week ago. Right, okay. And how were you the day before it came on? Have you had any other symptoms like feeling feverish, runny nose, sore ears? No, I not made any sort of cold symptoms. I think, okay, the day before. Okay, and at the moment, how are you feeling? It's still pretty bad. Yeah, sort of kind of flubbing. Yeah. Have you had any changes in your skin? No, it's been fine have you checked your temperature before you got a thermometer at home um i haven't um i don't feel like i'm feverish but i haven't checked and any problems with weakness tingling numbness in your arms or legs no not at all and what have you been doing since it came on have you been able to work or have you been at home um taking some painkillers mainly been at home um yeah i just kind of kind of seems if it's worse when I'm in a light room or like sunlight so I've kind of just been staying in as much as possible okay does it get worse with any position that you're on is it worse when you lie flat or when you bend forward um no I think I've generally been lying down better that way any problems if you cough or sneeze uh no I haven't really got a cough or anything Okay, can you just tell me a bit about your medical history in the past have you had any significant medical problems any hospital admissions operations and things like that uh no not basically nothing do you take any medication uh no just contraception and which contraception do you think uh my friend on who did you start that one uh about six years ago do you get any side effects from it um not really um no too much okay and anyone in your family had any medical problems uh my mom had high blood pressure and she's got history of migraines and have you had your blood pressure checked for her recently i haven't actually no Have you had it checked when you've had the repeat prescription done yeah yeah so okay do you know if there's been any problems with it um it's always been fine I think okay um and whereabouts whereabouts do you live at the moment you can be more just do you who do you live with at home uh just with health mates I'm just fine okay do you drink much alcohol today at their normal amount, probably, you know, a few drinks at the weekend. Okay, did you smoke? No. Did you take any other drugs of any sort? No. So, see what tablets do you even take already? Sorry? What tablets have you been taking already for it? I just passed that to you. I'm alerted to aspirin, so I'm interested in that. What happens when you take Um, I just feel really sick. Okay. And have you ever taken any non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen, naproxen, anything like that? Um, I have in the past. I haven't been taking it for that few days. Okay. Um, so this headache is new to you and you've you've not had regular headaches before. Yeah. What I would suggest is taking um some anti-inflammatory along with the parasitic okay um as you said you're eating okay yeah yeah i mean from the sounds of it it does sound quite like a migraine but obviously you've had no history of that in the past um and has anything changed recently or any anything you've done recently might have triggered it I know I would be the first thing to do is to take some anti-inflammatories along with the paracetamol make sure you're really well hydrated um and see how that goes and if if it isn't settling or it's getting worse or you get any other change in your headache um or you're unwell with it with a high temperature then we would certainly need to speak to you straight away about that the other thing is if you if you're getting persistent um headaches or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle or certain things seem to trigger these headaches then it would be worth having a further discussion about it to see whether we can work out, we can help that longer term. Okay, brilliant, thank you. I would try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked, if you haven't had a check for a while. Okay, I think to do is to have a thermometer at home so you make sure that your temperature's okay. Yep. If you have a raised temperature or headaches just getting worse and we develop any rashes or anything like that, then we need to speak to you straight away yep okay that's fine okay so I'll take tomorrow program and I'll um hopefully be a bit better at Daleton but yeah okay so if you got any other questions uh no that was it today okay okay then we'll we'll we'll um speak to you again everybody thanks so much so much bye
