Hi. Hello. Hi. Hi, I'm Maria. Hello, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. How are you doing? I'm all right, thank you. I feel a little weird today, to be honest. Yeah, so just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your full name for me, please? Yes, Maria Trabaloza. Okay, and your date of birth? That is the 1st of October 99. Okay. And your email address for me, please. Yes. Mtrava at gmail.com. Okay. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we have a confidential conversation. Yes, I think I am. Yeah, Good. Right. You've mentioned in your patient notes that you're having some sort of lip swelling and after you had a sandwich. Is that correct? Yeah, that is. Well, I don't think it was. It wasn't a sandwich, but it was something with cramps. So basically, I... I sometimes go with my friends to to this place called Fed Fa and we we regularly have like usually I have like a normal vegetarian soup or something and yeah and then I wanted to try something new so what happened was I I ordered a prawn soup it's it's it's called a lax it's like soup I ordered the prawn one this time yeah um yeah and then my feels like my lips start to feeling a little weird just in the in the corner sort of on the left first and then I don't know and then we went back we had a little bit of chat of banter I wasn't really paying attention now I feel that there is a swelling know there is like a swelling on my on my upper lip and it's kind of getting bigger i don't know what to do right so when did you have the prawn soup what time that was that must have been just off to work so maybe like around seven okay around seven o'clock and um how long did it take to develop the swelling? Well, I wasn't really paying attention so It must have been like must have been like and a half an hour maybe okay in half an hour you develop the swelling yeah Yeah Okay, and it's getting bigger and bigger Yeah, you don't feel it like really pumping blood and that's kind of getting bigger it feels like it's getting worse okay so just a few more questions um so you mentioned about you swelling of your lips is there any feeling of swelling in in your throat like your throat is closing up any feeling like that yeah actually i i feel like i can't breathe that well right now okay and do you feel like like your chest is tight? I don't know if it's a chest, it's just generally feel so difficult. Okay. Yeah, it might be, I'm not sure. Okay. Right. And just a few, have you ever had these, any kind of lip swelling in the past? Not eating any food? Yeah. well maybe I remember like a year ago a year ago I was out with my friends and I think we went like to a late night kind of Chinese place and I remember that I was quite drunk to be honest and I remember that after like having that very late i woke up the next morning quite swollen up and had also like okay felt really bad and quite difficult breathing but i don't know what it was i had it was like a curry or something okay uh and what did you take at that time did you use anything like antihistamine or anything when you had that last time Well, I generally have asthma so i tell i i take what's it called salbutamol inhalers yeah yeah so i do take that regularly but i've always taken it i generally have asthma and any other inhalers is it just the salbutamol that you use any other brown inhalers No, I don't think so. No, okay. Right. And so do you use antihistamines like cetirizine, loratadine, periton, any of those kind of things? No, I do sometimes, but I don't know which ones. So I have a peanut allergy as well. Yeah. I always had it. Yeah. I think I do get antihistamines for that, but I'm not sure which ones. And any point, because you've had peanut allergy, anytime you have to ever use like an injection. When I was a kid, I think I remember my mom told me about it, but I don't know what it was because I was small and I changed doctors. Right. Has your mom ever said that you had to go to hospital because you had a severe allergic reaction? Yeah, it's a well I was like six or something I I I think oh sorry swelling is getting oh Yeah, I think Are you know? You're busy right now to be honest. You feel busy okay Right, do you have any kind of antihistamines with you at the moment? No, I don't think I have. No, right. Okay. So, right. All right. I'm really a bit worried about you at the moment, Maria. I think we need to call an ambulance because From what history you've been telling me, it sounds like you could be going into what we say an anaphylactic reaction that's when your throat and your chest you know closes in and you might need an injection like what your mom's um you know what your mom told you as you were a young child okay right so is there any anyone with you at the moment or are you alone I'm alone at the moment. So hang on the line while I'll call the ambulance okay and I'll send them right to you okay and somebody just came so just call the ambulance make sure that person's with you till the ambulance comes yeah uh and because we are worried about an anaphylactic reaction so you need to go straight away Could you ask the person whether they have any antihistamines around in the interim while we're waiting yes oh mom mom do we have any antihistamines around yes yes oh yeah we haven't did it straight away and if mom can call mom if you can call the nine nine nine nine nine yeah and say that there is a suspected anaphylactic reaction and they need to come straight away. okay yes she said she will yes yes so straight away take the antihistamines in the meantime all right okay okay if you come up from the hospital do give us a ring back we might need to sort you out um with your injections and things like that okay yes yes or do yes okay then take care thank you very much
