Hi. Hello. Hi. I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Hi. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please? Sure. My name is Mary Smith. And your date of birth? My date of birth is August 16, 1976. And your email address for me, please. My email address is mary.smith at gmail.com. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Absolutely. Right. So you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw. Is that correct? Well, I think that's just like the first thing that I typed, but it wasn't really what I, you know, I just typed it and then I clicked submit. So that was a, I mean, it's part of the problem, but I would say that more of a problem for me is that i can't quite move my left arm i mean i can move it but it's it's numb and then i also feel some like tingling in my fingertips okay so numbness in the left arm here yes how long has it been going on for so I've started taking this boxing class. I've been taking a boxing class for a few weeks and I feel like maybe um it's probably been I'd say for at least two weeks and it's kind of gotten worse like at the beginning I just kind of felt a little bit of tingling and then it's gotten it's gotten worse since then then the numbing kind of started I can feel it both in my uh um you know a little bit in my elbow and then in my arm as well as in my hand and Now because it hasn't gotten better. I tried to get a massage It's not better or you know try to take warm baths. It's not better. So I figured I'd call you and and just figure out what's going on Right. So have you mentioned a massage and a warm bath? Any medications that you've taken so far? Well, it's You know, it's it's numb and I kind of looked stuff online. But, you know, I do take ibuprofen just because my, my muscles were sore a little bit and I've been taking this boxing class. So, you know, I kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand. So that's been a little bit painful. So I've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that. Okay. Like I said, I mean, I tried massage, I tried some hot baths, and that didn't help with this numbness there So I'm just kind of getting a little worried of course You also from you've just mentioned that your pain is From elbow downwards is that you know the tingling numbness elbow below not from your shoulder Well, it's kind of funny, you know, sometimes I will feel it in my shoulder like if I try to If I try to like, you know move like in boxing and stuff I will even like uh um maybe feel a little bit of a little bit of pain uh but I would say if I'm just like resting if I'm sitting like right now I can feel like it's numb and I actually feel tingling right now not in all of my fingers just in some yeah so which fingers do you feel numb okay so it's my second third and fourth finger uh-huh second third and fourth finger and is it your palm side or you know the back of your hand side which is numb or both no it's it's the it's this side so the front side it's the front side okay right and have you been dropping things at all like you know when you try to hold onto things like a glass or something have you been dropping it So not so much with the glass, but I will say, well, I play a little bit of a piano, and so I just noticed that it's been kind of harder to get the notes. I can grasp a glass, but because I use my right hand most of the time, you know, I'm not left-handed, so it's kind of hard for me to... So you would say this is a mild weakness, mild... Yes. So just to get my facts right, so you... It's definitely weakness rather than because of the pain you can't hold it there's two different things so you know sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you no no it's not hurting it's not hurting it's like numb i can't feel it right okay yeah fine so you have definitely having some sort some form of weakness okay any neck pain at all no not no neck pain no neck pain at all okay right okay so just a bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system. Do you have any past or medical history that you'd like to share? Well, I guess because of this. You know, I'm not sure if it's boxing. I also had a really bad cold like a month ago. I mean, I was out, you know, drinking with the friends. One of our co-workers just his three year anniversary and we kind of went crazy and we were like out partying until you know late hours and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me and then after that I was sick for probably good like two weeks I was at home I think I must have had some kind of like a flu or something so that and then I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago is like I all of a sudden just couldn't see from the uh from my left eye like i i lost some like a little bit of a field of vision um and but that that just lasted not very long i mean that just lasted maybe for i don't know 20 20 minutes uh and i kind of thought i don't know maybe it was the the cold you know and the virus and all that so I guess that's what I can, you know, that's the last thing I can remember. But in general, I'm pretty healthy. I mean, I, you know, I work out a lot and I don't really have any medical problems. Do you have any headaches at all from the, in the recent past? Um, sometimes I get headaches, but I think they're just tired headaches. You know, sometimes I'll get kind of tired, but I think that's probably because I work too much or, you know, because like I'll go for a workout and then I'll really just exhaust myself and then I just. kind of feel this fatigue uh or sometimes like this morning for example i just felt really fatigued and i couldn't even get myself to the gym but you know since i have this numbness it's kind of like hard to work out right do you wear glasses at all yeah glasses contact lenses no no so no glasses all right and you've not had experienced anything like a seizure fit anything like that what's a seizure but when you shit you lose consciousness and you stop shaking oh no no no no nothing like that no fits yeah okay and your weakness is only in your left arm leg walking and all this normal yeah Yeah, yeah, walking is normal. Yeah. You mentioned for a while you couldn't see, you know, the outside peripheral vision from your left eye. How long did that episode last for you know I think it was only maybe like 20 minutes or so it's almost like it happened and I thought oh my god it's probably I'm still like sick from this you know virus thing cold and so I just kind of slept it off and then when I uh um when I woke up it was gone sure okay um okay so is there any regular medications that you're using Not really. I just take Propan every once in a while. I take vitamin D. I take some. I like my GP. My GP really wants me to take iron supplements, but you know, there are this like huge bills. So I most of the time I just forget. But vitamin D I take and then sometimes I take melatonin to help me sleep. Okay. All right. And any family history you'd like to share? Any significant family history? I know that my dad has, I don't know if it's hypo, I think it's hypothyroidism. Yeah. And then my, like he's got some autoimmune stuff going on, like that much I know. And then my mom, my mom, she's, she's actually not. in a great shape She's got diabetes type 2. She's got hypertension. She's got gosh, what is it? Oh, yeah, she's got high cholesterol and I think that's it for her. Yeah, right. Any neurological conditions in the family? Ah, they're related conditions. No, okay, that's one. Okay, so right so after you know speaking and examining you know yourself on it I think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further I'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the boxing here okay a few things that's made me think other than just like a boxing injury is for instance um you know when you said you can't your vision went the peripheral vision was not there for about 20. so and that with the weakness of the arms make me think is there something else going on rather than just the injury what do you think may be going on so sometimes you know you do get things like ms multiple sclerosis so people multiple sclerosis can have um visual problems like what you've experienced and sometimes you know the odd numbness tingling sensations going on. Okay. Oh my god. Will I be in wheelchair? If we catch it a bit early there are treatments for it. Okay. I'm not obviously I'm not suggesting that you do have it. But it is quite important to find out that whether you have it or not. That's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be dealt with here. Yeah. So what we're going to do is I'm going to do an urgent, very urgent neurology referral. Yeah. What that might entail is a brain scan and things like that. Hello. I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm here. I'm here. I know this might sound a bit of a shock to you, but I think it is important that we investigate this a bit more seriously. All right. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, any questions at all? Well, what's... Okay, so you're going to do the referral. Should I be taking any drugs or... No, that's something we can't do. The treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that when you have an acute you know acute reaction or things like that but saying that first we need to adopt firm diagnosis yeah while you're waiting for this to be done if there's any weakness you know if the weakness progresses to your legs or there's any kind of headaches vomiting fits and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better then that would be an A&E Okay, got it All right Okay, thank you doctor. Yeah, I'm sorry I I do appreciate you are a bit worried, but you know, it's good that we know that you've come and spoken to us today and Hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling. Okay Thank you doctor. Appreciate your time. That's okay. You take it. Bye bye. Bye now.
