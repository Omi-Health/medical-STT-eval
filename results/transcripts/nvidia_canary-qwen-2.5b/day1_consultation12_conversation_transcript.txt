I was at home, I was working. on my computer and yeah, I just felt some nausea and I had to vomit and then I had some diarrhea straight after that. Yeah. Did you have any takeaway food or any dodgy restaurant food? I remember. Thank you. Have you been around anyone unwell with diarrhea recently, last week or so?

What do you do for work? I'm a software engineer. Okay, all right. Have you taken time off work recently? Uh, yes, yes, I have. This last three days I've been feeling really unwell so I couldn't work. okay all right and just last couple of questions with regarding your smoking and alcohol do you do either of those uh not really i drink infrequently like socially let's say and i don't smoke okay all right um fine so robert um i think having listened to your story I think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis. Okay. Which essentially is just a tummy bug. It's an infection of your tummy. And normally lasts for about three to five days and gets better. All right. The things you can do to really help yourself get better soon are you can drink plenty of fluids, really try and flush the toxins out of your body. Okay, you can things from the pharmacy which are called dirolite which can help replenish any minerals and vitamins you may have lost i'm sorry what's the name of that it's called dirolite um it it's a it's a type of fluid replacement drink um you can take some paracetamol if you're feeling feverish and weak I would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for the next day or two until you get better. Normally you have to be diarrhea free for about 20, 40, 48 hours before you return back to work. Let's see how the next few days go and if you're still not better next week I want you to come back and see me and we can have another look at your symptoms, okay? That sounds good. That sounds good. Thanks so much. Do you have any questions for me? No, I think that's fine. Yeah, I'll try to add and drink plenty of fluid and I hope it goes away. If it doesn't, I'll call back. Okay. I really hope you get better soon. Thank you a lot. Thanks so much for your time. Bye-bye. Okay, bye.
