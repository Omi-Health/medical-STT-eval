Okay, and Are you in a space that's quiet and you're able to talk oh sorry I um over 1990 sorry I'm 48 sorry I forgot that so you're 48 and are you able to talk at the moment yeah yeah okay tell me it says here you have a you're uh you're having problems going to the twitter yes so I have a I have a I don't know how do you say properly in English I mean with that's not in vulgar like the area for yeah, so it's lasting for like three days and Yeah, I I don't know I don't know what could cause it that I have a bit of pain and I had a bit of vomiting and yeah so these are kind of like the what is happening to me okay tell me how you were three days ago before this started did you have any medical problems well so I have I have I have asthma and I take some some well inhaler okay I don't know I take an inhaler and I have an allergy I have an NKDA allergy okay so I don't know if it's because yeah I don't know because it's yeah and apart from asthma do you have anything else I don't know maybe it's because you know it's this thing here in the stomach stuff i always have in the back of my head on my father because he died about 10 years ago of bull cancer okay so yeah this is kind of the the my my worries i don't know okay so you've you've had the diarrhea for three days And now you have your pain and vomiting yes yes has the diarrhea been getting better or worse uh uh i i think it is not getting better or worse it's kind of like uh uh like either like normal look at it like it it hasn't gone away it hasn't worsened okay and how often do you go to the toilet i go i need to go i i can't go to work because i need to go like every i don't know is this feeling like i go to the toilet and then when i finish i need to i feel i need to go again okay and and uh and yeah so i need to be like close to the toilet that must be hard Yeah, yeah. You have to drink more water than normal ah i don't know maybe i'm not drinking enough water yeah i drink i think i yeah i don't know i i think i don't drink enough water an important question have you noticed any blood uh no i haven't noticed any any blood and you mentioned tummy pain can you tell me more about your tummy pain like where it is and if it goes anywhere so the pain is mainly uh focusing in the center area of the abdomen like under the belly under the belly button yeah and yeah and sometimes i can hear my stomach like the cramps yeah you've been able to eat and drink uh yes but yes but i i go to the toilet all so often so i I I Yeah, I try not to eat a lot because I yeah, I just go to the toilet every ten minutes And you said the tummy pains in the middle of your tummy does it go anywhere else? No, no just there and it seems to be alleviated the toilet and maybe it's like gosh, I don't know what it is, but Okay, and when was the last time you vomited? I think it was this morning, this morning. I... But the thing is like, because I'm not eating anything now, so I haven't vomited again. Did you have any breakfast? I don't know. I didn't. No, sorry. Yes, I did, actually. I did. I had some fruit. I had some fruit. Okay, and you vomited that afterwards? And afterwards I didn't have anything then i got a bit of nausea and i vomited and then you know yeah and that was it and that was it and i have any so now i'm i think i'm okay but uh yeah and i don't yeah did you notice any blood when you vomited i think i do i think i do but this uh No, no, actually I can't say sorry. I'm sorry I I don't think there is blood because uh yeah it was it was the strawberries that I was having for breakfast so so yeah it wasn't blood okay and um did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain uh I I don't know to be honest sometimes I have when I get a bit of anxiety I I use my inhaler. Yeah, but my inhaler kind of Run out the one because you know I'm a foreigner. So I have this brand, but I bought the new one here. Okay, and I don't know maybe this new one has caused it. Okay, it's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this. Normally it's when you eat bad food or food that has gone off and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested but just double check have you noticed any problems with your breathing uh i always have problems with my breathing because of the asthma like when i make sure i need to use my inhaler a little bit but a part of the normal i haven't i haven't okay and how about chest have you noticed any chest pain no i haven't i haven't noticed any chest pain okay and how about um walking and talking are those all both okay uh walking and talking uh yes yes uh i i but uh But yeah, I don't walk very far because I need to go to the toilet now and then so I'm spending some time at home and when you press on your tummy does it cause any pain oh it does a little bit okay sorry I was just writing some things down so what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain. Okay. And it's normal, this is normally called gastroenteritis. So an infection of the tummy. Okay. Normally when patients have this, we do three things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because you're losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers. So if you start getting a temperature then you need to go to the hospital and you really stay home for the time being until you get slightly better okay and normally I normally things like antibiotics don't help they make the situation worse okay so that's yeah go ahead No, I was saying I didn't have any fever recently. I was swamped in a little bit glass or bed, but I I'm not sure if if I had a bit of fever, but very little or but I don't think so. I don't think I don't know maybe So I think that what we should do for the time being if you feel you're getting much worse Then I would suggest you get in COGP in real in real life in passing so they can look at your belly okay i will yeah i will book then i will wait a couple of days to see or one more day and then i will book yeah yeah cool do you have any more questions for me uh no that's uh that's it i was maybe just concerned about my father's medical history that would yeah some kind of risk so the the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had but if your things don't get worse then that's something that we can look at from the GP okay does that sound okay yeah that sounds good that sounds good thank you thank you very much doctor for your time bye bye
