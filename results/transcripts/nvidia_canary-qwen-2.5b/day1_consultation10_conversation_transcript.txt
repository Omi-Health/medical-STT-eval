next door hello hi can you hear me okay yeah i'm here right excellent before i go any further can i confirm your name and your age please sure um i'm vanda jackson and i'm 19 years old 19 years old like a man then how can i help you this option um so it's been going on for a few days now um it's not happened before and i'm a bit worried i it's quite hurts when i kind of pee um and yeah it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more um and it's really like I can't like go to uni properly I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet um it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in the bottom of my tummy as well right okay i'm so i see there's a lot going on there and i can see why it's affecting you um so you mentioned you've been doing it for the last three days mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. You get into the toilet more often as well. That's right. Yeah, it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days, I think, actually. Maybe just under a week. Oh, in the week, sorry. Okay. Sorry, no, I didn't explain it properly before. Yeah, no, it's been going on for about just under a week. And yeah, I've noticed sort of burning, stinging when I go to the toilet. Yeah. Have you noticed any anything in your urine for example any blood or? Um, I think well today I noticed um, it was like a bit pink the the urine Yeah, I think just today I've seen you any kind of frank blood. I mean red blood at all in your urine I think it was in probably I don't know it was pink so okay um fine we'll have to definitely explore that in a little bit or detail later on um you also mentioned some tummy pain as well can you tell me a bit more about that pain yeah it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy um mainly when I go to the loo I think that's when it's worse okay um can you describe is it crampy pain is it more of a burning pain I wouldn't describe it as crampy I don't think it's like a period pain it's a bit different it's hard to say an achey pain I suppose. Ache pain okay does the pain move anywhere else it's move towards your back towards your sides? No no okay all right um any other symptoms as well if you're up with nausea vomiting? No. I know you vomiting okay any temperatures or fevers um no i'm not diagnosed okay and how are your bowels up there are your bowels working okay uh i i usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway so i don't think it's any different okay what usually is when we say you have problems what kind of problems do you normally have um i think i have um ibs um so i just kind of pass my battles like quite quite a lot um and sometimes it's quite it's quite variable like sometimes it's a bit softer sometimes it's a bit it's sort of this a bit disgusting but like okay it's a bit and you know the better and kind of hard to predict okay all right but there's no new symptoms in your battles no no no new symptoms in your bells no no not okay all right um and i'm mad that sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions as you can imagine um uh can i ask are you currently uh are you currently sexually active maybe uh uh yeah um i have a long-term um boyfriend okay and um Have you noticed any other discharge from down below? So from the front passage? Not, no, I don't think so. Nothing unusual. Okay, have you, do you use any form of contraception? Uh, yeah. I'm on the pill. What kind of pill is it? Is it a combined pill or the mini pill? Uh, combined pill. Okay. fine um when was the last time you had um unprotected sex if you don't want me else uh i mean i mean unprotected isn't like no no condoms or anything yeah physically i i guess because i mean i don't really use condoms with my boyfriend it's like i don't know we've just kind of agreed uh so uh i guess a week Two weeks ago. Okay, all right. What I'm trying to get at is whether there's any chance you could be pregnant at all. I know you're on the pill, but we do have to ask. When was your last period? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago. Okay, all right. Just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms aren't any better, okay? Fine. In terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you uh eating and drinking okay uh yeah yeah eating drinking okay um i just have one kind of concern i don't know so i smoked uh this is quite bad but i smoked weed the first time like a week and a half ago I just wonder whether it's related at all probably not but I just thought I'd get some advice from you sure well thanks for sharing with me um so I don't think it is related to your symptoms I think it's probably just a pure coincidence um but uh you know I do strongly advise you to you know um make it a regular habit if you can um just for your general health moving forwards okay um Moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions apart from the ibs is there anything else i should be aware of no no okay great and what are any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the um combined pill apart from the pill um i take um something for the ibs as well um it begins with an m it's really hard to pronounce like mebbe something Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, that's right. And then after the cramps, the crampy pain. Yeah, yeah, right. And do you have any allergies, any medications? Yeah, I think that was an antibiotic called Clindamycin. Clindamycin? Okay. I think that's like half a year ago, something. Yeah, that didn't go too well. Right, so we... Okay, sure. I'll make an interest. in terms of family history any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys no no anything else good and socially tell me a bit more about your home situation who's at home with you um so i i'm living in halls at the moment uh uni um so i'm just living with a flatmate i suppose um but my family family live kind of outside London, not too far away. So yeah, my family are fine. And I see them now and then. Very good. Yeah, things are fine. I think they're okay, generally. Great. And what are you studying at university? I'm studying English. English, okay. Good. And how are you enjoying your course? Yeah, yeah, it's going well. Thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago. a few months ago yeah i really enjoy it very enjoy it. Yeah, yeah. Good. In terms of smoking and alcohol, do you do participate in either? As I admitted before, I tried weed the first time, but I don't smoke. I drink occasionally, kind of socially, with friends. Okay, what's made you have your first joint last week? I was just a party. I was just a party. I was other people doing it. I kind of was a little bit tipsy. Probably was thinking quite straight. But yeah, I completely agree. It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure. And as long as you don't stop something to look after you, so yeah, I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid it. Great. Fine. So at best as I would normally examine you but I think based on your story, I think, um, you know, I'm reassured by the fact that I think it's, um, probably just a simple, what we say, UTI or cystitis, bladder infection. Uh, you know, you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about. So things like fevers and back pain. um would be more worrying for me to hear um so some of we can treat quite readily with antibiotics um so we've got choice to antibiotic something called trimethoprine or nitrofurantoin which is a three-day course normally they're usually quite effective um for your symptoms it's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well if you can so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there um start the antibiotics make sure you're well hydrated drink plenty of fluids um yeah if you are having some pain simple paracetamol would probably be advisable um we'll see what the urine sample shows um and if it is indeed positive we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones um but if things are still not getting any better next week come back and see me and we can have another look again okay okay uh great um with with the urine sample and how do I go about doing that? So, no, well, that's a good question. So I will give you, I will organize for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices, which we can test there and then, where you're in debt and send off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results. Okay, perfect. Okay, great. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting if you have any of those give me a call okay Yeah, okay, how are we doing? Okay, thank you
