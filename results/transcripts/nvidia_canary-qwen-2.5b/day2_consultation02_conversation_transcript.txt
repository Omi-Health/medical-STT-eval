Okay, before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth? Yes, my name is John Smith and I was born on the 5th of April 1973. Okay, that's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes, absolutely. Okay, great. Okay, so um... Tell me a about what's going to happen. You said you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow. Yeah, I just noticed this like about a week ago or something. I have like a weird swelling on my elbow. I noticed that when I was in the shower. It's not painful at all. I feel fine, but it's just a bit weird to see that. um it's it's slightly warm um and I I kind of feel like this it's a bit fluid in inside or uh so so so I I to know what's going on basically and so did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow um it's the the left elbow left elbow okay and have you banged that elbow did you have any kind of injury? No, not really. Not that I know of. I haven't noticed anything. I can actually, like, be normally. It's just, I can just see that it feels a bit strange. Sure. Okay. And in terms of your job, do you do anything physical? Not really. No, I just, you know, sit at the desk. Right. Yeah. Okay. And has this happened before? No, no, I haven't noticed that before. I don't have any, like, history of seeing this. I don't remember. So, okay. And can I, can I just check, has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that? um no well i i do well i think i think i have something like osteoarthritis um uh it sometimes kind of hurts my joints but uh in my family i'm not sure okay no no sure so you know you said you think you've got osteoarthritis has anyone ever told you that have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis Yes, yes, yes, a few years ago. Okay. Was that a GP or a specialist or is it a physiotherapist? A GP, um, GP. Okay, all right. Um, wait, can I just, sorry, can I just double check how old you are, please? I'm 53. 53, okay, fantastic, all right. Um, and do you have any other illnesses at all? Um, Well, not not for you know, I'm allergic to peanuts. Are you allergic to any medication? No, not that I know of. Sure. And do you are you on any medication on a regular basis? No. Okay. and you normally fit in well mobile activity i do i do i do some sports i run regularly like two three times a week um yeah no i'm i think i'm healthy good well done that's good that you're doing that on a regular basis okay um and um uh can i is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now uh yes sure Okay, keep it with me one second right okay and if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that a bit higher so i can just see the underside okay fantastic all right and then just bring it around to this side essentially i can see the other side okay fantastic all right and if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers there's is it is it hot compared to the surrounding skin the adjacent skin It's a bit warm. Yes. It's a bit warmer. Okay. Um, and, um, is it very tender when you press on that? Now, if you give it a press, does it hurt you at all? On the on the tip of the elbow, it's it's okay. Just like next to it, like where the swelling is, it's a bit. Yeah, it feels a bit through it. Okay. All right. Um, what, um, I noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow. Do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body? No, not really. Do you have any more skin that's dry? Do you suffer from eczema at all? No. No. All right. Okay. So what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem, okay, is I think It would be worthwhile. This seems like what we call the bursitis, okay? So that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. What I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication in the first instance. And as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of causes of joint swelling. Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some blood test forms to be sent out to your house and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get the blood test done. And that will involve you having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies. So we'll do a full screen. and also check for things like gout as well okay okay the time frame for that will be um the results will come back to us after about five six days um from now it takes time for the forms to come out to you and if you get the forms that test on straight away by the time that we're expecting a result back you know one two days after that we're looking at maybe six days and what i'd suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood tests and we can get a gauge as to what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now, it doesn't look like to me that's something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So we are worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint. and your joint doesn't look like that however if your the elbow was to become very red very painful uh and the redness was to spread or become you know more intense then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment more immediate treatment okay do you think it's something dangerous like something I can't credite from that? Or is it, is it? No, I don't think this is anything dangerous. Don't need to worry. Okay. What I'm doing is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop. Okay? So if we go to worst, then this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward. So nothing's sinister or life-threatening. What I'm doing is I'm just saying, in case things worsen these are the things that we'd be looking out for and this is what we have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully. And I don't think you're going to have it. But I'm just saying the what-if scenario. Is that okay? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me? Well, just wanted to know about this. Yeah, it feels a bit better now to know that. Okay, all right. At the end of that, thank you. Okay, so I would take ibuprofen regularly, okay? You can get that over the counter. That's 400 milligrams two times a day. And you should take that after food, not in an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it, yeah, okay? Sure. All right, so what I want to do is I'll get the form sent out to you and we are going to arrange a follow-up appointment maybe within a... Actually, you know, the form of appointment doesn't have be face-to-face if it's more convenient for you to do it over the phone you can do that with the phone video you can do that as well that's your call but you contact us after you've had the blood test done or we can review things then okay okay yeah that sounds good I I'll do that and if I see that it's getting worse I'll probably ask for a physical appointment but sure sure that's good I think all right then okay um Take it then. So just leave that with me. I'll sort all those bits of pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll we'll um review you after the test things go well all right all right take it on the bus bye
