My name is Jessica Smith and I'm 19 years old. Okay. And how can I help you, Mrs. Smith? Um, yeah. So, uh, I mean, this is, this is a bit embarrassing, but it's sort of a... hurting when I when I use the bathroom when I pee and um it's been going on for a few days. So I'm a little bit worried about it. I'm not sure what to do Right. Well, thank you for coming in. So hopefully we can help with your symptoms and as you mentioned it started a few days ago um So can you tell me a bit more about that? What kind of pain it is that you're experiencing? Um, it's it's not too bad. It's sort of like a stinging kind of pain um, it's not like unbearable but uh it's it's definitely uh it definitely bothers me my pee um and uh yeah i also maybe sometimes get some like pain kind of lowered down in my tummy when i when i go to the bathroom yeah okay yeah and and uh the pain your tummy is it can you describe the feel the pain to me is it cramping burning sharp i don't know yeah i don't know maybe uh sort of sort of cramping i'm not really sure but it's not like it's not like cramping like when I get when I have a period or something it's like I don't know okay okay um fine and have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal um not I don't think so I haven't noticed that no okay fine have you noticed any any funny color to your urine so has it been uh any blood in your urine or have you seen any other darkening of your urine? There was a little bit of blood earlier today, but besides that, not at all, no. It does kind of, it kind of like doesn't smell very, it smells a bit weird, I guess, but no, not really anything, anything drastic. Okay. fine okay um right let me just write a few notes down as well um fine and you mentioned the pummy pain that also started a few days ago does the pain move anywhere else does it move towards the back or towards your flank the sides no not really no no okay fine with the symptoms if you notice any other symptoms like nausea vomiting uh no not at all. Okay. Any fevers or temperatures? Sorry, any any fevers or temperatures? Sorry, I didn't hear you. No, no, no fever. No fever. Okay, fine. Sorry. Um, okay. Um, in terms of your bowel, are your bowels working okay? Um, I think so. Yeah. What's up? Any any diarrhea, loose stool? uh no not that i've not that i've noticed at all okay all right and um jessica sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions uh just to get a full history um hoping that one will be okay are you currently sexually active uh yeah i am okay is that with a regular partner um yeah so i i've had a boyfriend for about a couple months now. Yeah Fine. Okay. Um, have you noticed any other discharge from from down below? I Haven't noticed anything. No, okay. When was your last um last STD screen if if ever? Oh Don't think I've ever I don't think I've ever had one right okay go on um and um do you use any form of contraception at all oh yeah we use condoms we use condoms okay and when was your last period a couple weeks ago is there any chance you could be pregnant perhaps say again is there any chance you could be pregnant I don't think so. It's always worth asking young females like yourself. So if that obviously if you are worried about the pain, not getting any better, then I would always advise you doing a pregnancy test to rule that pregnancy. Okay. Fine. So just moving on, moving on. Are you otherwise fitting well? Um, yeah, I think I'm feeling okay otherwise. Yeah. And so by that I mean, do you have any other medical problems, medical history? Um, so in the past I've had some, uh, some IBS, um, but other than that, I think no, like, no serious medical problems that seem, yeah. Okay. Do you take any regular medications? Oh, no. I did a, I did a little bit ago or a couple days ago Try some over-the-counter bicarbonate to try and help with the pain, but it wasn't it wasn't really helping Okay, so you tried that and it didn't help. Okay. All right. Um, do you have any allergies and medications? Oh Yeah, I'm allergic to clindamycin And what happens when you take clindamycin? Um, I I get some like a swelling basically It seems like a quite severe allergy to it is that right um okay fine in terms of your family history is anything i should be aware of um relates to kidneys bladder bowels gut uh no i don't think so not that i not anything i know about okay all right and tell me a bit more about your home situation who's lives who's at home with you Um, so with you? So I live in a flat near my college with a couple of friends of mine. So I'm not living at home or anything. Okay, and are you working at Lorne or are you a student? I'm a student. Okay, and what are you studying? I'm studying biology. And how's that going? It's good, yeah. yeah it's really it's really interesting uh learning about learning about how how the world works yeah great do you have any aspirations for the future in terms of careers uh i don't know maybe a doctor someday you never know we need doctors um what about smoking and alcohol do you drink much in a way of as a do you smoke or do you drink much in a way of alcohol I don't I i don't smoke uh i do drink like on weekends so socially okay all right um right excellent so um at this stage i'll proceed examination but um based on your story um just to summarize really it's the last three days you've been having a bit of burning pain and passing urine a bit of crampy tummy pain lowered down um essentially but no other fevers or back pain if i understand correctly i think probably do you have what we call a simple uvi or urinary tract infection bladder infection which can be readily treated so i'll give you a course of antibiotics today something called either nitrofurantoin or trimethoprine and it's normally a three-day course so one tablet twice a day for three days and that should hopefully help your symptoms. But I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids. Let's try and flush that infection out of your body if you can. You can try cranberry juice. I can sometimes help with your symptoms. And if you're still not better by the end of this week, I'll want to give me a call or come back and see me. And we can have another look at your symptoms. Okay, so three days of the medication and then wait a little bit. If it still doesn't go away, call back. Yeah, absolutely. And things to look out for would be, you know, if you are having kind of high temperatures, back pain, just generally feeling more unwell, you know, I do want to give you a call back because then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we want to avoid. So do give me a call if you have any concerns, okay? Okay, is there anything like, should I be worried about not having sex or anything within the next week or anything like this? I mean, if you can try and avoid it, I think that'd be sensible. He's great at using barrier conception. I'll recommend you to continue using barrier conception. But if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up, that'll probably be the best for you and your boyfriend. Okay. That makes sense. Great. Okay, thank you so much. Maurice, wish you all the best. Yeah, thank you.
