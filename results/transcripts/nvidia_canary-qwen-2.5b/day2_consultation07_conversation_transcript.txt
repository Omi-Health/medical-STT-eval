So how can I help you today? Yeah, I was having a bit of chest discomfort so I was doing some gardening um a couple of hours ago and I felt not exactly a pain but um like a pressure on my chest um feels like someone's sitting on my chest um and I've noticed um a bit of nausea not no vomiting but um I'm pretty sweaty um short of breath and it kind of feels like someone's sitting on my chest. Right, okay. Now, do you have these symptoms right now, or have they gone off now? No, they're still present. Okay, so you've still got the chest discomfort right now? Yes. Okay. We're probably going to have to call an ambulance for you. Okay. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to task my colleague next to me to sort that out while we do that i'm going to ask you a few more questions okay sure give a bit more information to the the ambulance team when they when they arrive okay so just just to double check um where exactly in the chest is the pain um it's in the middle of my chest um over uh yeah my my pecs so um yeah but not not necessarily to one side i mean it's quite a diffuse pain right is it spreading anywhere else like down to your arm up to the jaw the neck anything like that yeah it's it's um mainly in my left arm uh it's feeling a little bit um uh painful and and in my shoulder as well right okay do you remember what you were doing at the time Yeah, so it started just when just when i was gardening so nothing that was too strenuous um i was just kneeling down and uh yeah it wasn't running or anything it wasn't during any physical exercise cool okay and how much activity do you do normally do you walk a lot or do you run or do you go to do any no i don't i i generally don't do much activity at all um yeah have you had this before No, this is the first time actually right okay okay yeah and are you aware of any palpitations like your heart beating faster or more prominently than normal um yeah it's it's beating a bit faster now i think that's because i'm a little bit stressed um about the situation but i haven't noticed it um beating faster than usual um today so i know you're stressed we've got an ambulance coming on the way okay yeah um we'll take take care of everything. So don't don't worry. Can you keep it in the house with you at the moment? I know no one's in the house at the moment. Okay. Um, and is your front door open? Ah, yes, it's open.

Okay. All right. It's very important that you communicate that to the hospital. Okay. Detail you've just told me because um we we may need to consider aspirin to spillover. Okay. Um, all right. Um, now in terms of um, what happens from here, the team will assess you and then they may take you in to one hospital or another based on how bad what the ecg looks like and what kind of treatment you might need okay okay what I'm going to do is we'll stay on the line for the time being okay until they come and then once they come then I'll hand over to them I'll explain what's going on all right okay okay sure okay yeah thank you okay okay thank you very much okay thanks bye thank you bye
