Yeah, just for the last couple of days, I've been feeling really sick in my lower tummy, and I've had a bit of a temperature, so feeling quite like hot and sweat. See, and it's i'm really uncomfortable okay so you've been feeling uh nauseous um and you've had some pain in your lower tummy or you say you've been feeling sick in your lower tummy yeah it's more of an ache so like an ache in my lower tummy i think because feeling hot and sweaty sometimes i think it's sickness but yeah a bit of an ache okay so um feeling Hot sweaty unwell for three days uh feeling sick nausea um with an ache in your lower tummy any actual vomiting um so yeah no just nauseous no vomiting yeah luckily and it's only been for a couple of days but yeah two days yeah okay um and uh any problems with your waterworks or diarrhea No, so I'm I'm going to the loo a little bit more often than usual um i drink lots of water but it does feel like more often um yeah like nothing nothing too out of the ordinary um and i was i was a little bit like um uh i don't know constipated i guess about a week week ago by monday now okay so you've been concerned week ago uh things uh you're having regular bowel motions now he said you had a bit of diarrhea a bit of watery did you say no it was more like i was just a little bit bummed up and then about a week ago that kind of cleared and i'm a normal now okay And you're saying you're going you're drinking lots of water you're going to the toilet more frequently for a wee is that yes yeah i'd say so i i tend to drink a lot of water anyway but i feel like i'm going to the toilet more any pain when you pass urine um no no pain no stinging No, just just seems normal yeah okay and um and sort of no foul smelling urine right um no nothing nothing i can think of now you're having you're saying you're going a bit more frequently are you having to go with urgency to the toilet for wee no there's no urgency um Yeah, no pain or urgency. Just, yeah, being quite frequently, but it's all seeming normal. Yeah, I probably wouldn't have thought of it being linked, but yeah. Okay. All right. So the main symptom is feeling sick with this, you've been feeling bungled up and this sort of pain in your tummy. Just to ask a few more questions about the pain in your tummy is it how would you describe the pain um it's yeah it's like below my belly button um it's it's aching um it does make me feel nauseous um yeah so it's kind of more like a I guess I can a, a dull ache, um, just below the belly button, kind of, yeah, here. Um, and it's, it, is it constant or is it coming and going? Um, it's, yeah, it's feeling pretty constant over the last couple of days. Um, And just need to ask a few questions about your periods and stuff. Any chance you could be pregnant at the moment? I don't know. Probably not. I don't think so. Okay. Sexually active at the moment? Yes. Yeah. And I mentioned about periods. I did notice a bit of... I don't know, it's like not necessarily like spotting but like in my my pee is like a little I suppose I think I thought it was my period it's like a little bit pink in your pee did you say you're so your pee is slightly red or slightly pink yeah but I am kind of like you who are my I didn't know if that was like yeah, part of it. Okay, so when was your last menstrual period? Um, around a month ago, yeah, three and a, three and a bit weeks ago. Okay, um, so it's three. And, uh, did you say, so you're sexually active, you're using contraception. What? I've got the I'm the implants and one sexual partner regular regular So just to go back to your symptom of constipation, can I just clarify when was the last time you had a bowel motion? Yesterday. Okay, and do you feel like you are still quite bunged up at the moment? No, it seems to have cleared up so i was about a week ago but i'm okay okay now the last few days yeah it's been okay okay all right so you just to sort of confirm your symptoms um you're feeling sort of sick nauseous with tummy pain which is fairly constant um How did the tummy pain come on suddenly or gradually um it's only been for the last two days um so i guess yeah quite recently so it's come on gradually is it yeah not sudden onset okay and uh your last menstrual period was just three and a bit weeks ago um and you but you say you've had some a little bit of spotting possibly before and in between periods or recently. Yeah, the last kind of week or so. Yeah, the last couple of days really. But because I was too on. Yeah, I think. Yeah, just the last couple of days. OK, but you're expecting your period soon. Yes, yeah. Sure. OK, and just to ask a few questions, do you have any other medical problems I need to be aware of? No, I'm allergic to moxycillin. But no other medical problems? No, not that I'm aware of. Any drug allergies? Oh, you mentioned moxycillin, but anything else? No, that's um and do you take any medications at the moment um no no medications by money implants i think it's called um implant on yeah okay uh do you smoke no okay and uh do you live with alone with your partner partner with my boyfriend and um any other medical uh sorry any uh this is running your running your family um no i need this to bring to mind in my immediate family um my brother is a type 1 diabetes okay great so um is there anything that you're particularly concerned about with this nausea and the constipation? I don't know. It's just a really, like, really horrible ache. And I'm nauseous, hot, sweaty feeling. I'm not really sure. Yeah, why um yeah the last couple of days that's probably all this yeah comfortable yeah anything that you'd hoped particularly to get out of having this consultation anything i'm sorry Was there anything that you'd hope to get out of having this specific consultation other than a diagnosis and getting better and, you know, being on the right track to to feeling better yeah no that's kind of I just want to um get back to normal yes a bit more quickly yeah for sure okay um so and then finally I didn't ask you do you have any discharge or anything like that from down below um no no no discharge no discharge okay All right. So I think this could be a few different things it could just be simple constipation uh you mentioned that you were bummed up but you did go yesterday so it's um and your your bowel habits that you've been going regularly uh but you did mention that you were bummed up um but there could be a few other things going on I would quite like to see you to do some further, to do an examination and to do some tests as well. We need to definitely rule out pregnancy with you and possibly do some other examinations or sort of fail the test. So would you be happy to actually see a GP face to face soon? Today, ideally? Yes, yeah. Yeah. Are you, and you're feeling hot hot and sweaty? Have you been feeling um light headed at all or like you're going to faint? No, no, not like I'm going to faint. Okay. All right. Well, we're just sort of tying up, running out of time a little bit. But I'd really like to see you for some more examination and investigations. If in the meantime, between now and me, or AGP seeing you, you feel worse in any way you get lightheaded um you uh you have you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you um then I think take them quite seriously and and see somebody more urgently if possible um okay is that was there anything else that you want to talk about right now I'm glad we've got the full rolling of this and uh we can um sort of see you again to take this a little bit further okay yeah thank you really appreciate that okay all right thanks for your time thanks bye
