Um, and it's been affecting me. I need to stay close to the toilet. And, um, yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities. Sorry to hear that. And when you say diarrhea, what do you mean by diarrhea do you mean you're going to the toilet more often or are your stools more loose yeah so it's like loose and watery stool going to the toilet quite often and like some pain in my like lower stomach okay and how many times a day are you going let's say for the last couple of days probably like six seven times a day Six, seven times a day. And you may have mentioned this mainly watery. Have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools no no blood yeah just watery and loose stool okay and you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well yep whereabouts is the pain is actually in my lower abdomen so uh like um yeah just to one side one side what side is that uh on the left side that's right okay then can you describe the pain to me Yeah, it feels like a cramp, like a muscular cramp, and yeah, I feel a bit weak and shaky. Okay, and there's a pain, is it there all the time or does it come and go? It comes and goes. Does the pain move anywhere else besides on the towards your back? No, just mainly in my stomach. Okay, for it. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well. What do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been having, have you been feeling feverish for example? Um yeah it doesn't feel like, yeah I just might need to feel weak. I haven't had a fever um at the moment but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started so um yeah around about three or four days ago. You measure your temperature then? Yeah I didn't measure my temperature no but I felt um just a bit hot. Okay I can do that. Any other symptoms like sweating or like? No. And any vomiting at all? Yeah, so I vomited at the start of the symptoms, but now I've stopped vomiting. You stop vomiting, okay. And was your vomiting, I know it's not news we talk about, but was it just normal food colour? Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit. and there's no blood in your vomit is that right no no okay um and um any other symptoms at all so you mentioned tummy pain you mentioned diarrhea you mentioned you're vomiting uh anything else that comes to mind um i had a loss of appetite um so i've been eating this much but i've been able to hold down fluids okay so you're drinking fluids but what kind of foods have you managed to eat anything anything? Um, just soups and, uh, yeah, light foods like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly. Okay, fine. Um, and so, uh, this started three days ago, the symptoms, are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms to kick on? So, for example, things like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people who would sing the symptoms? Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago um uh but other than that i've yeah been uh eating normally i think unusual yeah do you remember what you ate um yeah i ate at a chinese restaurant with friends okay anyone else on well with similar symptoms Um, so no one else in the family, so I have a wife and two kids and one child was vomiting but they haven't got diarrhea there's no one with the same symptoms okay okay sorry um right and uh in terms of your your overall health are you normally feeling well or um yeah I mean other than um asthma um I use an inhaler everything uh else is fine okay and is your asthma well controlled Yeah, that's fine. Just just use an inhaler and that's under control. And you don't have any other tummy problem, bowel problem that I should be aware of? No, no, okay. And apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications? No, no other medications. Okay, fine. And in terms of just your day-to-day life, you said it's been affecting your life. Yeah. In what way has it been affecting your life? So I need to stay close to the toilet because i go quite frequently during the these past three days okay um yeah other than that it's uh yeah the main concern and if you are you currently working at the moment uh yes yeah i i work uh work um i'm in accounting okay have you been going to work last three days or you've been at home uh yeah i've been going to work okay that must be difficult for you then yeah it's been quite difficult and you say you mentioned you live with a wife and two children is that right yes yeah all right um just a couple of other questions we need to ask um do you smoke at all uh no i don't smoke and do you drink much in the way of alcohol uh no i i don't drink alcohol no okay wow so um uh normally at this stage i like to um examine you if I say um um but having listened to your story so i think you um just recap the for last three days you've been having loose stool diarrhea a bit of tummy pain mainly on the left hand side uh and vomiting and feeling quite weak and lethargic um you mentioned you had this chinese takeaway as well three days ago and i wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems okay um it seems like you may have something uh called gastroenteritis okay which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your of your tummy uh mainly caused by viruses but it can be a possibility of bacteria uh causing your symptoms um at this stage uh what what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management so i don't think you need anything like antibiotics it's really just um making sure you're well hydrated so drinking fluids um uh there are things like diuretics you can get from the pharmacy which it's um it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins okay um and if you are having vomiting and diarrhea i would say recommend that in the first you know first couple of days yeah if you are feeling feverish and weak taking some paracetamol uh two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help i would certainly advise you to take some time off work actually i know you're quite keen to work um i would say next two two to three days um uh reaction clears from your system just take some time off rest um you know if your symptoms haven't got better you know in in three to four days i'd like you to come back and see you again okay sure because if it is ongoing then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing the symptoms yeah and we may need to do further tests like taking a sample of your stool so we can test that. Et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, sure. Yeah. How's that sound? That sounds great. Yeah, yeah. Do you have any questions for me? No, no further questions. Okay. Is the treatment plan clear? Yeah, yeah, that's very clear. Thank you. Great, well I wish you all the best. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Right.
