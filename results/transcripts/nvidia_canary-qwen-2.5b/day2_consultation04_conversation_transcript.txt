If you put your fingers up and down like that you might be able to feel the pulse I've got it. You got it. Okay. You sure? Yeah All right, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting, okay? So I'll just get my stopwatch up. Okay. So if you can, um, you've still got the pulse? Yeah. Okay. So if you can start counting now, please. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. If you can stop now, I think that was about 11 or 12. So that would make your heart rate about 66 to 74. That's okay. Good. Fantastic. And the next thing I'd like you to try and do, okay, it depends on the lighting, so it may not be possible, but next thing I'd like to try and do is just to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger. And then let me see how quickly the redness comes back. Okay, so if you can see what i'm doing now my fingers come right behind the screen i'm squeezing it okay just watch me first you're sorry just watch me first yeah i'm i'm squeezing it and then you can see that it goes pale and then it goes back to the normal red color okay so if i can get you just to put your finger up to the your camera and then with the other hand just try and squeeze it and even a very good circulation Okay, perfect. That's great. Thank you so much. The last thing I'd like to do is I'd like to try and have a look down your throat. Okay. Are you doing this consultation via a phone or a laptop? Phone. A phone. I've rested it on my laptop, so I think we're good to go. So you say that again? I've got it rested on my laptop. Okay, okay. So if you if you um position your device up above your head put your head back mouth open wide and let me see if i can have this that's fantastic and say ah ah perfect thank you for that excellent lovely okay last thing is if i can get you to feel inside your neck just on the sides here okay uh bio atoms apple tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not no i feel pretty normal to me. Okay. I think. All right. Now, sorry, I've forgotten your name. Doris. Doris. So Doris. What I think we need to do is, this sounds like you might have a chest infection. Okay. If you're coughing up blood and you're feeling your heart racing. I think you think you need to be examined today someone needs to listen to your chest and um maybe check your blood pressure as well check that you're stable i have to say examining you now from what limited examination i could do online your everything does seem to be okay in terms of you don't seem acutely unstable however if you've got this kind of pain um when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a pneumonia or chest infection and um that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope and you may need um an antibiotic this is one thing i need to ask you have you been on any long haul flight recently no no okay have you ever had any clots in your legs or clots in your blood clots not that i know of no okay anyone in the family have that no no Okay. All right. What I think we'll do is we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today. Okay. I would like someone to listen to your chest and to check your blood pressure and to recheck your pulse as well. Just make sure and check your temperature. Make sure all those parameters are okay. You may well need an antibiotic. Okay. Do you have any allergies to any antibiotics? No. No. Okay. I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now because I think you need to have that basic assessment first before we proceed to the next step. But that's what I would predict the next step might be. I'm going to leave a number in the notes for this appointment for you to ring our support team and then they will book you in for a face-to-face appointment. We've run by our GPs today and they'll do that assessment and then we'll take it from there, okay? But we don't think I'm dying of lung cancer. Given the way in which you have presented now, just one day with a fever and this slight pain concurrent with the blood and the phlegm, that's not usually how lung cancer is present. It's more insidious over a longer period of time with other symptoms. However, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding. We'll see you. Okay. all right are you worried about lung cancer well you know you start coughing up blood and you think you're gonna die of lung cancer sure of course yeah so just remind me how old you are again i'm sorry 45 45 okay it's something we do need to be cognizant of okay um and we may end up having to do a follow-up chest x-ray things don't settle down but at the moment it it seems more like a chest infection rather than a lung cancer that's good to know. Yeah, that is good to know. Yes, because that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are okay because chest infections can become nasty as well. It can lead to infections in other bodies. We want to avoid that as well. So let's get you checked out today and hopefully we can put your mind to rest and get you on the right course of treatment. Perfect. Thank you very much. All right, you work. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye.
