When did it all start? well it seems to have been slowly getting worse over the last couple of weeks. Um, I was become quite troublesome in the last few days. Uh, I kind of normally I can walk to the shops without a problem, but now I'm having to sort of sit down and catch my breath and I'm even starting to get a bit breathless just about the house. And uh, it's got me kind of worried. don't really know what's going on okay okay is there anything you're particularly worried about um well i've i've uh i've got um heart failure okay uh i was told that uh a while ago um and i got a bit breathless when i was first diagnosed and put on some that um that helped but i'm a bit worried it's just getting worse Right, okay. So you mentioned you've been feeling short of breath for the last couple of weeks, but maybe the last couple of days it's got a bit worse. And you're now feeling more breathless on kind of minimal exertion, you mentioned. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all with your breath? So, for example, any pain in your chest? No pain in my chest. Okay. Have you found yourself coughing? coughing at all Uh, I've got a bit of a dry cough, but it's not too troublesome. Okay. Okay. And how's your general health otherwise? Are you feeling weak, lethargic? Um, I'm feeling a little run down. Um, but otherwise, otherwise pretty normal. Okay. I've noticed my ankles are getting bigger. Okay. And what do you mean by that? Uh, it's just like it's sort of swelling up a bit. Okay. Um, is that, is that both? Both ankles? Um, yeah, both ankles. Yeah, it's a bit embarrassing. Okay, I can imagine, yeah. Um, and again, over how long has this, have you noticed this for? Um, I kind of noticed it the last few days. last few days okay. And is this something that you've had before in the past? Uh, I think my ankles did swell up a bit last time the heart failure was a problem. Okay, okay. Um, fine, okay. So, just to really recap, so you really, the last couple of weeks, you've been feeling breathless, but worse in the last couple of days. You mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough. and some swelling in in your ankles um but importantly no chest pain um and and if you had if you if you noticed your heartbeat racing at all so palpitations or skipped heartbeat no not really okay and any temperatures or fevers uh no okay and how about your appetite are you eating and drinking okay yeah i i'm that's fine Okay, and your water works, are you passing urine okay? Uh, yeah, that yeah, I usually pee a lot. Yeah. Sure. Okay. All right. Um, fine. So moving on to your past medical history, you mentioned heart failure. Any any other medical history I should be aware of? Uh, well, I was told I had like a they called it like a small heart attack. about five years ago. I, uh, I had, I had like some chest pain and they took me to the hospital. Okay. And, um, they, uh, but then I just got better. Okay. When you say small heart attack, did they give you a name for what happened? The name of the diagnosis? Uh, I can't remember. It just called it something like that, a small heart attack okay was it like an injury or No, they they said they it seemed it was like more than an injury okay um uh but um I didn't but I only had to stay in hospital for a few days okay And yeah, I've been okay since then. You've been okay since then, okay? All right. So apart from me and the heart, the heart problems, the heart failure, any other problems I should be aware of? No, I think I'm otherwise, I'm okay. Okay. Do you take any regular medications apart from your diuretics that you're taking? Do you know which ones? Yeah, I take something called furosemide as well. And do you know which dose you're taking? I can't remember. I'm sorry, doctor. I have to check. No problems. Any other medications? Yeah, I take aspirin. And lotralol. The metoprolol was this? Or lotralol? Sorry, the connection is not very good. Okay, thank you. Yep. um uh simvastatin in the 800k all right. Any allergies at all? Any medications? No, no allergies. Okay. Anything in the family that's important for me to know? Any family history of medical problems, heart problems, lung problems? Uh, my father died of a heart attack. I'm sorry to hear that. um old was your father when he passed away? He was early 60s. Early 60s, okay. Anything else I should be aware of? My mother had osteoporosis. Okay. Is your mother still with us? Yeah, she's still living. Okay. All right. And socially, sir, to tell me a bit more about your situation at home who lives at home with you uh i live on my own i've got two cats you've got two cats okay great what do you think they're my family uh they're called um they're called polly and tim okay um so this is junior cats and um in terms of day to day, are you working at the moment? Uh, I work part time as a, uh, lorry driver. Okay. And how is that? Is that quite stressful, long hours? Uh, it's okay. Um, I, uh, yeah, like when I'm working, it's pretty exhausting. I guess I'm a bit worried that if I get sick, I won't, if I get more sick, then I won't be able to work properly. Yeah, this is definitely a consideration, isn't it? So let's, let's try and get you better soon so it doesn't have any impact on your, on your job. And do you find yourself doing a lot of anti-social hours? Did you do a lot of night driving, weekend driving? No, no, I, I, I only take shifts during the day. I don't like working at night. Thank you. Always. And what about smoking alcohol? So, because they can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems. Do you smoke at all? Not anymore. So you used to smoke? Yeah. How many did you smoke a day on average? Oh, it was about a pack a day back in the day. And how many years was that for? Oh That was good 25 years, okay, the world of stopping I'm gonna must be very difficult for you the world of stopping And what about alcohol? I Don't drink alcohol, okay, you do much in the way of exercise, sir? I Try and walk the shops at least once a day, um okay but uh that's about it I've yeah I don't I don't get running like I used to when I was young right okay and certainly now with your symptoms you you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the store uh to the shops you said um right so um based on your based on your history and having listened to your story I wonder whether you've had a flare-up of your heart failure sir um we can sometimes happen um um and you know it's so I seem like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be um and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure there's obviously um it's the first thing that comes to my mind um now there's a couple of options to move forward um Given that you otherwise well at the moment and having examined you, your chest and your saturations and blood pressure all okay, I'm quite happy to increase your dose of Fruzamoid so maybe rather than one tablet a day we can give you two tablets a day for the first few days and see and see how you're getting on okay I think that would be better I think it's definitely worth treating your symptoms but what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart to see how well your heart's pumping. Okay. Is that something you've had before? Yeah, so an echo scan, it's a jelly scan of your heart. You may have had it done before when you were diagnosed. And it's just to get a good... Sorry? Yeah, I remember now. Okay, fine. That's something I can organise for you today and it may take a week or two weeks for that to be organised. But I think certainly in the meantime, let's get a blood test done. We can check your full blood can, look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function. And we can definitely increase your fucose might to one tablet twice a day. But I would like you to come back and see me in about a week's time to see how you're getting on. Does that sound reasonable? I think that sounds like a good plan. And of course, in the meantime, if you are getting more unwell so if you're getting more breathless or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness then you know said i'll want you to give me a call sooner than that and we can have a chat on the phone as well okay i'll see you okay do you have any questions for me uh that's all pretty clear thank you very much doctor great and then i wish you all the best have a good day you soon thank you
