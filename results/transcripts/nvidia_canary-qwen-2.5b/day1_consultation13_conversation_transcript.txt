There's no good list. Hello? Hi there. Hello there. Thanks for being here. Before we go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Yes, it's Adriana Catran Gieva, 26 year old. Okay, Adriana, how can I help you this afternoon? Well, I have this like really crazy headache that's been going on for a few days and it really annoys me i do okay where when when did i exactly start this headache uh around three days ago maybe three days ago okay and whereabouts in your head is this pain um it's basically like it kind of feels all over my head but like mainly around my right eye um okay um and is it headache there all the time or does it come and go um it's it's kind of comes and goes um but i mean he is there all the time but like sometimes it's stronger okay so it comes and goes okay and if i was to ask you on a scale of one to ten um ten would be the worst type of pain you ever had how would you rate this headache It's probably an eight. Okay, if and if i had to ask you to describe the headache to me um in terms of the nature of the pain is it sharp is it dull is it crampy is it throbbing and it's kind of it's dull but sometimes it gets a bit sharper so basically it like it developed gradually i guess it's like the first day it just started when i was at work and by the end of the day it was like pretty pretty like it was a lot basically and then I was thinking okay maybe I'll just go to sleep and then I woke up the next morning like it was even even worse basically so you think the headache is getting worse over the last three days yeah okay have you tried anything which made the headache better So I tried ibuprofen. So I took like a few um for the last two days basically but it doesn't really help no in the past it did help me which is why i decided to try it but okay and except the headaches any other symptoms at all so um any problems with your eyesight or your vision Not really, but just when it started, I got this like weird shooting lights and like now like light is quite annoying my eyes. When you say annoying, does it hurt to look at bright lights? Yeah, yeah, it hurts. Okay. And do we have any loss of vision or blurry vision? Not loss of vision, I wouldn't say. It's just like some lights from shooting lights be any nausea or any vomiting um one like basically I'm sick with the headache but I know vomiting I mean you say sick you mean you feel sick okay yeah no vomiting okay any neck pain or neck stiffness no Okay, and any difficulty with speaking or um, speech? No. Any difficulty with weakness in your arms and legs? No. It's hard to focus though. So I had to take a couple of days off work actually. Oh really? Okay. Okay. Well, I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on. Um, any recent head injuries at all? No. Okay. And have you had anything like this before in the past? Yeah, I mean, headaches, you mean? Or similar to this kind of head aching? Yeah. I mean, I had, but usually after I take ibuprofen, it kind of goes away. So, but this time it's just not. It's not. Okay. Go ahead. um any temperatures or fevers no any rashes at all on your skin no not a doubt i've noticed okay and just moving forward are you otherwise fit and well Adriana am i what sorry you fit and well do you have any other medical history i think so it's just the headache any history of migraines at all Not myself. I've never had a migraine, but my sister and my mum have them quite frequently. Okay. Fine, I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask, do you take any regular medication? No. Are you on the pill? No. Okay. Do you have any allergies in your medications? Not that I know of. Okay, so you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines. Yeah. Are they is that normally well controlled or are they having difficulty controlling the symptoms? So my sister's like better like it's kind of it's very rare but my mom's is like quite bad. Usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that it's yeah takes her out for a few days basically. Okay, um socially tell me a bit more about your life outside of um outside of work so who lives at home with you and i live with housemates so three of them excellent and are you working at the moment you mentioned this is impacting your work yeah so i work well i work in i.t so i work with computers a lot so it kind of is difficult to focus. I had to like reduce the brightness of my screen. Hmm. Okay. Do you wear glasses? Yes, I do. Have you had any recent eye check done, eye test? No. I've been wearing them since I was five, five year old. Okay. So please bear in mind if you feel like your eyes are straining. I always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Have you been more stressed or anxious at work recently? Well, it's been a bit stressful kicking off a new project, but yeah, nothing out of the ordinary really. Okay, all right. Great. Regarding smoking or alcohol, do you drink or smoke at all? I socially smoke and I drink not only socially. Only socially. Okay. Right. Now, Adriana, do you have any idea that's what could be causing your symptoms? Have you read anything online or spoken to people? Not really. For the first I thought it's stress or maybe I didn't drink enough water because sometimes when I don't drink enough water I I like get headaches um but I don't think that's it and I'm like worried it's I don't want it to be a migraine because I know what it's like from my mom and my sister and it's really annoying so i i really don't want to have that and i know it's genetic so i've researched that but i don't know if that is the case. So yeah. Is there anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today? Yeah, maybe just kind of, if you have any recommendations that I can take something stronger, because apparently ibuprofen doesn't help me. Usually it gets resolved if I have a headache and like after like one or two days, but currently it didn't help me. How many tablets did you take of ibuprofen uh three a day three a day okay all right um so adriana so um really what i think is going on here i unfortunately i do think this could be a headache very similar to migraine um the reason i say that is because the history is very suggestive of it given your mom and your sister also migraines I think it's something for us to think about um now i'm not saying it's going to keep happening that's it may just be one off but it's certainly worth treating it today with some stronger analgesia or painkillers um now moving forward we have some options which we can discuss uh you try the ibuprofen now my only worry is i'm not sure whether you're taking the correct dose you can take up to two tablets three times a day oh right there's definitely room for improvement there or i can prescribe you something stronger like naproxen which is another anti-inflammatory which can be helpful uh we can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or codeine which might be helpful as well Yeah, I think Cognizant is what my mum takes for when she has migraines. Okay, I think it's that it's only worth making so I can give you a prescription for that today. Um, with regards to, um, the next few days, it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's, you know, if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse. And, you know, like you come back and see me in about a week's time, week to two weeks time. If you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches, we can think about giving you medications as prophylactic, which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis. But we can have that discussion next time. Okay. Okay. In the meantime, if your headaches aren't getting any better or they're getting worse, um you know i want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner, okay? Okay. If you have any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs or you're just not feeling very well, just give me a call and come back and see me. Okay. All right. Great. Great. Well, have a good day. Thank you, you too. Bye.
