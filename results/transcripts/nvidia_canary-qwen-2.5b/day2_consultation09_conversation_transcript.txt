Hi there, good morning or good afternoon, sorry. Hello there. Hi, good afternoon. Good afternoon, Jack. Hi, this is Dr. Dean Mizer from GP at Hand. Hi there. Hi. So before we start your appointment, could I please confirm your full name and date of birth? Yes, my name is Jack Armani. That's great. And my date of birth is 12 August 1958. That's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yes, I am. Okay. So how can I help you today? I am so I woke up this morning and Hello, yeah, I'm still here. Yeah, so I'm a bit worried because I woke up this morning about an hour ago and I couldn't move my left arm anymore. Okay, and how is your arm right now? Um, well, like, I feel no pain, but just can't move it. So you still can't move and what time did you wake up you say it was an hour you sure about that yes okay um now can i just double check has this ever happened before no no uh it's really the first time okay and did you sleep anything in an awkward position or in a different bed or anything like that last night uh no uh everything as um and um is there any discoloration in your hand um no okay does your hand feel cold no really then the arm feels fine apart from me not be able to move it okay and it's on your left side have you had any symptoms in your left leg at all no but um I feel a bit of tingling on the left side of my face right okay um and how long has that tingling been there for uh since I woke up since I started to feel the since since the the arm really stopped moving so an hour ago Okay Now I can't see you this is a telephone appointment, but have you noticed any kind of Asymmetry in your face or did your face expression look different on one side compared to the other anything different at all? No, not really it's just I've been like a bit of issues like I was trying to drink earlier and I grew bold a bit and and the tingling on on the left side. Okay, so um you have some difficulty swallowing. Is that right? Um, yeah. Any problems with your speech? is your speech different to how it um sounds normally um yeah it feels a bit harder uh it's more complicated maybe maybe and be more slow i need to think more about it okay is there anyone at home with you uh no okay this is something i should be worried about Well, I'm concerned that some of the symptoms you've got may be symptoms of a stroke. Okay. So that's something that can be dealt with, but it needs to be dealt with as an emergency in the hospital. Should I call, would you be able to call the ambulance for me? I'm happy to do that. what we need to do is to make sure that they've got access to you when you come so maybe you could leave the front door um unlocked to sit in the hallway but i'm going to arrange one of my colleagues next to me to call an ambulance to your home address now okay okay thank you that's being done right now as we speak while we're waiting for that i'm just going to ask you a few more questions is that okay sure Okay. Do you have any other illnesses at all? I have type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Okay. And are you on any medication for that? I'm taking melt forming low certain and I'm low deeping. Okay. Do you have any allergies uh allergies to any medication um only penicillin i believe okay and are there any illnesses in your family at all uh my dad has got um heart disease but um i don't know more detail okay anyone else not really And um are you normally living alone uh yes you smoke it all uh i used to okay how much alcohol do you drink uh i will have a few drinks so that we can um maybe a couple more during the week so what what drinks we're talking about uh a beers uh like pints okay all right um how are you feeling now have you got the symptoms right now still the arm yes yes the the arm still can't move and i think this beach is getting a bit harder okay all right so the ambulance is on its way all right um and what they're going to do is they'll probably take you down to the local hospital, A&E, and they will ring through for the stroke doctor to assess you to see whether they can give you any kind of treatment for that, okay? So don't worry, they're on their way. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to stay on the line until they reach there just to make sure that you're okay. Okay, is there anything i should be doing now uh not at the moment no not at the moment just uh make sure that the the front doors open sit in the hallway by the front door so that they've got access if needs be if for any reason you can't open the front door okay okay all right then so i'm just gonna stay in the line and we'll and we'll wait until the ambulance comes okay i'm gonna go to the door okay then all right thank you thank you
