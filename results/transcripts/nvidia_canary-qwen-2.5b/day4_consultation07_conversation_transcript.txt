Hello, can you hear me okay? Oh yes, I can. Can you hear me? Yeah, good, good. So my name is Joe. I'm a doctor here in Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? My name's Vinton. And your date of birth? 9th of May, 2016. Okay, great. And now you're in a safe place oh sorry a safe and confidential place to work and just have to go ahead with the consultation yes yes I am great so how can I help yeah so I have a call that I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week and it's been causing me problems I've had to stay away from work for about three or four of those days because of all that is Okay, I'm trying to hear that so you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week and what can't what came first uh the sore throats came first and then after a day or two the cough okay okay and uh are you coughing up anything no it's very dry okay So I'm just going to ask a few questions about the current symptoms and a little bit about your background and something else about what we can do a little bit later on in the consultation to help you. But before I go on, anything you're particularly concerned about or have any ideas what might be going on? You said you had a cold. Well, I mean, you know how we all are. Once this happens, you Google it and it seems to be all kinds of bad things. It could be, it could be. could be a cold or flu or something it could be tuberculosis it could be cancer always comes up so it would be good if none of those right so so yeah I can provide a little bit of reassurance um and uh we can talk about those a little bit as well and was there anything you're particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation um Well, yeah, so reassurance. So like hopefully some sense that's not anything you can prescribe me to make it better or any advice or maybe even a sick note. So if I need to stay with my mum for a bit longer, I can get one. Sure, sure. Okay. All right. So we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms and I'm sure we can get those things and some reassurance about your concerns. So, um, you mentioned that you started with a sore throat about a week ago developed into a bit of a dry cough um i'll just ask a few questions around those so um do you have any shortness of breath yes yes i've been having short yeah i've been having short yeah you are short breath and uh do you have any wheeze or chest pain You're feeling uh a bit of a book like you you're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well yes okay and how when did you start to develop the shortness of breath let's see so so the so today is friday so it was about last week friday or thursday cough was satsya so and so the so the shortness of breath was a thing shortly after the cop so maybe a day or two later so three four days ago two or four days ago he started to develop some and is the cough worse at night time no no it's the same period of the day same period of the day um and uh when you say you're short of breath just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are so are you able to to get um to like walk up a flight of stairs, for example, um, or are you short of breath and rest? Oh, yeah, it's like when I'm doing walking, um, and I do exercise now and then. So it hasn't been super bad. Like it hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual and I'm a little bit worried. And you're a bit concerned about that, okay. So I just need to ask a few things about your background as well. So do you have any other medical conditions or medical history? No, just no, no history of asthma. No. And any history of clots on your legs or your lungs? So, these are these of these. No, in your family's had those, clots in the legs or lungs. Well, my mother had lung cancer your mother had lung cancer do you smoke no have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos you know i don't know if asbestos ever smoked i mean once or twice in amsterdam but not really okay um and uh this They're just going back to the your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough. It's a dry cough. No, you're not coughing up any phlegm. Do you do you have and you say you don't have any chest pain as such? Are you taking any medications? No, no, no. Okay. Are you allergic to any medications? Not to any medications, but I'm allergic to peanuts. Peanuts, okay. And that you mentioned that your mother had lung cancer. Any other family history of any significant illnesses from running in the family? No, no, that's the only one just lung cancer from my mother. Just lung cancer. Okay. And you say you have a cold. So do you have sinus congestion or No, it seems to be all entirely with just my throat like my nose is just your throat and any recent travel or have you always lived in the UK? No, so I I haven't always lived in the UK like so I was born in the US and moved over about 12 years ago but it's been a recent travel just to Europe nowhere to exotic okay so no no no recent travel no significant recent travel anywhere um okay and are you coughing up anything other than um so you're not coughing up blood or anything like that right good and uh are you feeling feverish hot cold sweaty Yeah, so a little bit feverish at first. so the first three or so days of this but then the fever's going away okay and in general do you for the story yeah yeah i was just going to say also had a bit of a headache like headaches that come and go but like right now it's fine okay and in general would you say you're feeling you're beginning to to feel better worse or sort of um staying same So it's like it's up and down so so let's see so i it started last week and i stayed home from work two days this week i think it was maybe tuesday and thursday so like i felt better and then worse again and then better and then worse again so it's been a kind of constant but constant can be a variable okay and i just need to ask any other sort of risk factors that you may have. So no sort of significant weight loss or unexplained weight loss. Any wafers? So no weight loss, but I have been losing my appetite recently. And I mean, I usually eat a lot, so I kind of enjoy eating as well. But that's been a bit concerning. You've been losing your appetite recently. Yes, and you're a little bit concerned about that but you haven't you haven't lost any weight that you think of no not that and any um sort of rashes or anything uh and you no rash okay um so i would ask to examine you now but um i I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat at least to see if there's a probably. Oh, we can try one. Oh, no. Well, no, it's OK. I might think about doing that. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck that you can feel? No. Not the no. OK. And so finally, you were talking about I mean, it sounds to me that you've been a little bit up and down sore throat developed a dry cough um you are slightly short of breath but not too overly concerningly short of breath what I would say we're just coming to the end of the consultation now is is if you feel significantly worse um uh if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness um or breathlessness that you are concerned about then i would advise you to see a medical professional, a GP and actually see somebody physically. But I think for now I can sort of try and reassure you that if this clears up as I expect it would, so I expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days, if it's not please get in touch with the medical professional again. and I would expect it to and so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis your concerns about lung cancer are and was that the other thing you concerned about oh yeah yeah so so again if you're not getting better please see somebody again I've just got four seconds now so nice talking to you and we gotta we gotta tidy up yeah okay so And I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days of work and paracetamol lots of fluids and Rest up and as I say if you're not feeling better, please get in touch. Okay, all right Thank you
