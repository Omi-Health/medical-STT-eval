Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Yeah, I can. Can you hear me? Hi, my name is Dr. Gohill. I'm one of the physicians that works at Babylon. Are you in a quiet and private space to talk? Well, I am, yes. Good. And can I confirm your name and date of birth please? It's Joe Blogs, it's the 7th of June 1974. 74 and how old does that make you? Sorry 54. Perfect. I'm supposed to be 53 but yeah great and it says here um it says you're having chest discomfort is that correct? That is correct yes. Right. Can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort when it started and how you're feeling at the moment sure um it's been ongoing for a couple of hours now um i'll tell you that this gone quite suddenly i was deep in the garden and it if i had to describe where it is somewhere in the middle of my chest and it's more it feels more like a pressure they just comfort them more than a pain um if I had to describe what that comfort feeling is like going sitting on my chest yeah great so you've talked about your chest are you still in discomfort at the moment uh yes as you said. Okay, and when it started, how would you rate it out of 10? Okay, about 7 out of 10. 10 being very sort of unbearable and you see that pain, 7 is quite manageable, well, it's quite this old comfort. And how about now? It's still the same. Okay, and tell me, before this happened, what were you doing? I was relaxing with my wife and we're watching Jeremy Kyle. Okay. So, God is a gardener. Okay. And how often do you do gardening? Every other week, so fortnightly. Okay. And are you normally fit and well so are you normally okay to garden as you would? Yes. Great. And apart from this do you have any other medical problems? High cholesterol and the patient has hypertension. Okay, so that's high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Do you take any medications for that? No, I don't take any medications. Okay. And are you allergic to anything? I have three. Okay. So let me summarize what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago and you experienced chest discomfort, which was roughly seven out of ten. Yeah, it feels more like someone's sitting on your chest as opposed to pain yes that's good and apart from this have you noticed anything else unusual specifically with your breathing uh yes i have um i've got shortness of breath i feel slightly lightheaded okay and is that getting worse or better? It's remained the same, although I'll say recently I've noticed in terms of sort of breathing, I've had some difficulty climbing stairs and I had to sort of walk uphill. There's that sort of challenge as well. And when you get short of breath when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain? No pain as such, but there's often calf pain and leg swellings. Okay, so let me confirm. You have the pressure at the moment and you have shortness of breath. Is that correct? That is correct. So given what you've told me about your past medical history, I think it might be worth you calling an ambulance. Okay, get you to the hospital as soon as possible. Because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart. So while we talk to you, I will ring an ambulance who should come to your address. Right. But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone so I can gather some more information that we can give to the paramedics. Is that okay? Should I be concerned about anything? It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and you've got some chest pain, I'm always worried about the heart first before anything else. And we need to look after your heart before anything else. So apart from this lightheadedness and this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else unusual? Nothing else unusual. I'm not sure if I talked to you about nausea. I've noticed nausea about no vomiting. Do you have anything to eat or drink this morning? No. And you feel still feel nauseous at the moment? I have, yeah, I have, yeah. So I have a couple of other questions to ask you and I'm going to reel them So apology for not letting you talk very much. Yeah, that's fine. Have you noticed this pressure radiating to your head? No, to my head, no. And how about to your left or right arm? Yes, there is some pain in my left shoulder right now. And does that pain go anywhere else, to your left arm or to your back? No. And have you noticed any problems swallowing or drinking water? No. Good. And have you noticed any problems going to the loo? No problems going to the loo. And you're normally fit and well apart from the two things you told me about? Yes. However, there's some problems just performing daily activities um Like I said, with the difficulties climbing upstairs and going uphill, I try to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house, nothing too strenuous. And do you live at home with your wife at the moment? Yes. Okay, I would suggest if she's there, you let her know that you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today. So she might need to get your things together. Got it. I got it. The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm and have some water if you need to. Don't take any of those medications. The paramedics should be with you very shortly. All right. So when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about. The one is your chest, so your heart. And the second is your breathing which is your lungs okay so they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate so don't be worried okay and when you get to the hospital you'll be seen by a consultant pretty pretty much immediately yeah that's right reassuring on the inside Sure. So I will let the paramedics do their job and when you're at the hospital, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how everything's going. Oh, that's great. Great. I'll book another appointment to see you soon. Once you've had your adventure. That is perfect. Thank you so much. No problems. Do you have any questions for me? No questions. I'll just await the end of this. Great, thank you very much no problems i'll see you soon thank you so much right okay
