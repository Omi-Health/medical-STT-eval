Hi there, it's Dr. Smith from Babylon. Can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address, please? I can't hear you at the moment, actually. Could you turn up the volume up? Yeah, that's better. Thank you. Okay, sorry about that. Are you in a private place so you can have a consultation? Yes. What can I do for you today? I've been having this blinding headache for a few days and it's like really bothering me and I find it very hard to focus or like I can't even go to work. Okay, and any headaches in the past before this? Not really, just they... on and off um i recently had the one for like two days um but it just went away with acupuncton so nothing like for longer than two days before so how did this start um it just started all of a sudden i woke up one morning with a headache and that was three days ago and i just keep having it doesn't really go away with acupuncton either i try that but it just It gets a little bit better but like doesn't go away okay and where about seeing your head is the pain um it's kind of all over but I feel like over my right eye is a bit stronger okay any problems with your vision or any problems tolerating the light um lights definitely make me more sensitive like um I don't really like strong lights um yeah vision I think I get this shooting lights sometimes I'm not sure how to explain it just a bit of a weird kind of vision okay and any any nausea or vomiting No, feeling a bit sick but not vomiting. Any tingling or numbness or weakness anywhere? No. Any change in your smell or tastes? No, no at all. And in the past when you've had headaches what have they been like? I would say quite normal headaches just a bit of a pressure. in between my my eyes but nothing major okay and with with this has it been that all the time or is it coming and going kind of all the time um so when I take up a drop and it gets a bit better so it's a bit like less um it bothers me less but then I still have it still there um and what would you say the severity is if if 10 is the worst pain you've ever had and 0 is nothing, what would you say the pain is like? I guess it's mostly 8 and then it comes down to maybe a 5. Okay, and what about at night time? Are you able to fall asleep? Yeah, I'm sleeping well. Is it waking you up in the night time? No, no, no. I can wake up with it in the morning. Okay, any worse when you change position or bend over or cough or anything like that? Sometimes when I stand up quickly I get a stabbing thing. Or if I turn my head like I kind of feel like something is moving inside. Okay. And have you had any eye checks recently? Yeah, I actually had one recently and nothing changed my vision. Okay. And have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears or pain over the sinuses? Any? Or flat? Any nosebleeds or coughing up any blood or anything? No. And just recently, have you been well or have you had any general problems and you change in your weight or tiredness? lack of energy anything like that um no change of weight maybe uh lack of energy but maybe because i'm just telling this head ache so i find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities but you know when you have this constant headache um i work from home but couldn't really manage to do it all the time so sometimes i just do the day off So you've been you've had it over three days. How many days have you missed off work? So I work from home all these three days and first day I work from home and then the second day I just do the whole day off and today I just tried to work from home the first half of the day but I just stopped in the morning because I couldn't focus. Okay. And any other medical problems in the past? I think I only had a bit of pain when I was younger, but no cause was found and I went away. But that's the only thing I know. Okay, have you been abroad recently at all? No. Do you take any medications? Just the pill. Which one? Merthiolon. And when did you start that? About a year ago. Any side effects with that? No, I don't think so. Have you noticed any any um increased frequency of headaches since you started that? Um, no, I don't think so. This is just very recent so nothing um but when you've had When you described your headaches in the past, you said they were just general. Did you have any visual symptoms, flat lights? No. More than vomiting with them. No, nothing. Your blood pressure check recently with your pill? Yeah. I had a choice in the pharmacy when I got the pill and they said it was normal. And when was that? A year ago. okay um and any allergies to anything and who do you live with at home sorry who do you live with at home uh just by myself okay and do you smoke uh no do you drink any alcohol regularly yeah how much in a normal week do you think um probably like three beers once a week Okay, and do you take any other drugs at all um no apart from the upper right and the headache sometimes and the headache gets really bad okay um so i mean it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache and you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well Yeah, but you haven't had a high temperature. Have you checked your temperature uh no i didn't i don't really feel feverish or anything okay um i mean it it it could possibly be a migraine type headache but that it's still ongoing for three days we probably should put you into an appointment to get an examination um obviously if it settles in the meantime then we can cancel that but we should do neurological examination, look at the back of your eyes as well. Okay. In terms of medication, I can prescribe you something similar to ibuprofen, but a bit stronger, which you can take instead of ibuprofen. And you can take parasitic at the same time. Okay. So if you're happy to book an appointment with us, with the support line for us to do a full examination, and start the medication which i've prescribed you take it with food if if you're you said that when you go to bed your headache's okay and not waking you up in the night time yeah it's not um but you mentioned migraine and that um reminding me that my mom suffers from actually has migraines okay any other family history of medical problems um no i think that's it but i know that my mom like she has quite bad migraines she's like has the vomiting and everything okay that's fine um i mean if if in the meantime before your appointment your headache is getting unbearable getting worse or changing then call um if it's that bad then you should go to a and e and have an examination and you can call us for further advice on that okay and when when you have an examination with us we'll check your blood pressure as well just to make sure your pill is still appropriate for you because sometimes if we if we do think it's a migraine then you would have to change your pill if you've had these flashing lights and things like that is there anything in the pill that can close it or is it Well, so that pill, if you were having regular migraines with flashing lights or other symptoms, it wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill particularly we'd have to change it something else all right but you can carry on with that for the moment okay have you got any other questions um so would you like um send me a referral to a specialist or to yeah book an appointment with the support team then we can do a full examination then okay perfect all right then take care thank you very much bye
