So you mentioned it's all through. If you had a chance to look in the mirror if you had a look at the back of your throats no i i mean i i shave every day so i'm i'm looking at myself it's not not not a pretty sight to be honest at the best of times but it's been a wee bit a wee bit rough uh the last few days for sure yeah no i mean if you didn't if you notice any kind of white spots in the back of your back of your throats redness Oh right, oh sorry, I mean it? No, no, I don't I don't really like to look you know to look after it so I I haven't haven't tried to do any of that. I understand it's not pretty as it is a lot it's not like we always um uh recommend but um moving on in terms of your ears any dullness or blocked ears pain in your ears? Yeah yeah a wee bit I mean you know I'm 50 years old now and my hearing's, you know, it's not as good as it used to be, but, you know, I think it's alright, it's alright. Okay, okay, fine. Moving down to your chest, how's your breathing been? So do you feel more breathless or tight in your chest? No. No, it's not. So you're breathing Sorry, what was that? Your breathing is fine is it says that you're it's not labored or No, it's it's it's it's not it's not good. It's not good.

I'm just moving on just very quickly. Any other symptoms? Any nausea? Any vomiting? Any tummy pain?

It's just kind of like you know when you're when you're bending like elbows and knees and just just a wee bit kind of stiff you know all over okay and just remind me sir when did your symptoms all start you say a few days ago yeah i would say what is it today it's wednesday so wednesday so it would have been what was it saturday because i was out okay i was out having dinner and then yeah i i came yeah yeah yeah it would have been that because i was out for my wife's uh she's she was doing this wee thing with a wee bit of celebration so we're out for that and I remember saying to her I was like you know what I'm I'm I'm not feeling great you know I'll stop it out with her but I it would have been that Saturday so watch that book five four five days ago yeah yeah okay yeah yeah and you remember anything that might have set your symptoms off is it something you've eaten or have you been traveling recently abroad or No, I haven't been I mean I mean as I said I was out with my wife I don't know whether it's like you know the restaurant went to was like and it was like pretty good so I wouldn't have expected them to be serving me anything dodgy or anything like that but I I don't know you know okay so I can see and without prying too much what were you celebrating?

You said you live with your wife, anyone else at home with you? No, not kids, the kids have a, they form the nest. Okay. So it's just me and the messes. Okay. Good luck. Yep. And are you waking up moments yourself? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you mean? uh well i'm it's one of the there's a wee factory just uh down the road and so we just you know, we just manufacture like uh, uh, it's like kind of steel steel parts, uh, things like that, you know, so it's a good we job keeps us the roof over the roof over us pays the bills really. Um, yeah, exactly. What about smoking and alcohol, sir? Do you either? I I do I do like how we drink uh I the dog the old doctor I had he he he did say I was drinking just a wee bit too much and I'm not like you know not not an alcoholic or anything but just just uh yeah do like a few a few pints right now and again we roughly on average how many you drink a week uh pints well whatever you drink is it pine beer lager wine spirits you know maybe maybe thought like four four pints and like saturday and then you know sunday as well maybe like nine nine pints in a week i would say okay okay and what about smoking sir uh we Every now and again, but I'm trying to cut that down. I've got a wee uh what are those wee things called do we vaporizers okay okay yeah I got I got myself one of those so I've been I've been cutting down on the cigarettes uh and I just got this wee this wee thing it's great it's actually like amazing by the way I wish you all the best in your journey to quit I would highly recommend it um if you can it would certainly help your health as well um so just to make it just to summarize i think you know based on your story um i'm not worried i think you know what what you said she had is bit of a bit of a viral illness perhaps a bit of maybe any signs of a flu um which i think should settle down um really on his own over time um things to you know you can do to help yourself you know just stay rested drink plenty of fluids If you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty taking regular paracetamol would be beneficial um you mentioned feeling a bit short of breath um i'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics i don't think you've got a chest infection but what we could think about is giving you a a script for antibiotics which you maybe use the next 24 to 48 hours if your symptoms don't get better all right so what so if i'm I just lie down and take it easy Yeah, if I'm still one of that rubbish then Yeah, I'll give you a script today give it about 24 to 48 hours if you feel like you're still feeling breathless and Run down I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics something like a moxaline one tablet three times a day And if you're still not best about next week come back and see me and we can have another look all right okay okay so I just plenty of rest lots of water exactly yes absolutely right that is that's perfect that's just what I wanted to hear great well I'm glad I could help and uh I wish you and your football team all the best I hope so, I hope so. It's not looking too good, but thank you. Cheers. All the best.
