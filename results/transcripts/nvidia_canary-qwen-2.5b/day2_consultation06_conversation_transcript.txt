Hello. Hi there. I'm Dr. Dean Mazzis from Babylon. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Sorry. Before we stop, could I get your full name and date of birth? Is that possible? Yeah, sure. My name is Juan Doe and I'm 27 years old. So I was born in 1991, 17th of November. That's perfect. Thank you for that. Are you, John, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yeah. Perfect. Thank you for that. Okay. So tell me what the problem is. You've been having some difficulty breathing. Is that correct? Yeah, exactly. I'm kind of struggling to breathe at the moment. I got stung by a wasp recently. Well, I'm not sure whether it's kind of bitten or stung. But I'm feeling like slightly anxious that... there's a bit of I've got a bit of a rash on my arm where i got stung and and i kind of yeah as i say i've got this difficulty breathing and potentially um there's a bit of swelling in my lips and tongue feels a bit weird right okay so when did this beast thing or be by occur um it was just a few minutes ago right okay um And your lips don't seem swollen to me right now, but do they, which, can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen? Yeah, it's just kind of on the right hand side and it's just a bit sore. Maybe it hasn't kind of really swollen up, yeah. Well, okay. You said you've been having some difficulty breathing. Yeah. Your breathing seems all right to me right now. The reason why I'm clarifying that. because we have to decide whether this is an acute emergency, whether I need to send you into hospital straight away, or whether I have more time to ask questions, okay? So, um, do you feel that you've got difficulty breathing right now, this minute, as we speak? I, I, I don't... feel like it's like particularly acute but i'm just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a bit worse sure i don't i just wanted to speak to someone sure now you do the right thing and i can understand it is quite anxiety-provoking okay all right can i just double check before we before we carry on asking other questions have you got a history of anaphylaxis uh not that I know of no okay have you ever been given an EpiPen uh I haven't no okay all right let's take a step back now so in terms of the B thing is did you see the B or you you're just assuming it was a B um I I I find it difficult to tell the difference between a B and a W but one of the two. Yeah it was one of the two. Okay okay and the area of your body that's done where was it did you say it was your arm? Yeah it was on my arm. All right and you've got a rash there can I have a look? Yeah sure it's just just there. Okay all right that looks okay to me right now. Did it look red to you at the moment? It's it's slightly red. Yeah, and I'm kind of there's a bit of a like a hole there where I think that the yes, yeah, yeah, the puncture mark. Yeah. Okay. All right. Um, now is is there any swelling around that area that you can see? I couldn't see any. Um, not particularly. I guess it's just a bit kind of blotchy. uh and a bit of a rash. It doesn't feel like it's swollen sure. Okay. All right. Um Now have you taken any medications probably you probably haven't cuz it was a few minutes ago, but have you is it that don't take any and and histamines or anything like that? Not at the not at the moment. No nothing nothing. Yeah Okay Now if I can just go back do you have any history of any any kind of illnesses at all um i i've had eczema before um okay that's kind of the major thing nothing nothing okay have you got a history of any allergies to anything uh i'm allergic to plentacillin all right good um and in your family is there any history of any illnesses or any history of any kind of acute Not that i think is particularly relevant no i don't have i don't have any right and um do you have allergies to any kind of cats or dogs or pets or anything like that uh not that i know of i've yeah i've been around dogs and cats yeah and you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware no okay Can I ask, do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks or anything like that uh yeah uh sometimes occasionally right okay have you ever been on medication for that um no okay um great now i need to ask a few questions maybe not directly related to this but just for general information purposes so um are you working at the moment yes what do you work as uh i am a uh computer scientist okay and um you're living alone yes okay do you have any pets at home um i have a cat okay great what i'd like to do now if that's okay john is i'd like to have a look inside your mouth okay um one of the things that um things that would be worried about if someone's got an acute allergic reaction is to see whether there's any swelling of the lips or the tissues inside the mouth or the soft tissues of the airway. And I can, I've got a fairly good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put it back, mouth open wide, sit somewhere where there's good lighting, and I just want to have a look inside the throat, if that's okay. now um um can can I just get you to do it again just say ah this time ah okay fantastic brilliant okay um uh John based on um how you look how you're talking to me and how you're breathing and the appearance in your wrist um I don't feel that you're having a life-threatening allergic reaction. Now it's very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite. It's a localized inflammatory reaction that is normal and that immediate reaction, that redness and that's maybe slight swelling, is usually temporary. What we're worried about is when someone has compromise compromise of their breathing so you mentioned breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling in the lip thankfully i can't see any of that right now right one but that's the most urgent and most pressing thing that we'll be watching out for given that it hasn't happened initially it's unlikely to happen later okay so we have like a stage one a stage two reaction for these types of bites And usually if you're going to have their reaction, it will happen straight away. So we may be coming out of the danger zone now, but I'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens. So for example, you would have swelling of the lips, difficulty breathing, you might have something called stridor, which is an inspiratory sound that you, when you're trying, trying to breathe, it makes like a rasping sound like this. Okay. Thankfully, you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me that this is a localized alert reaction however if anything changes if anything deteriorates either make an appointment with us or go straight to A&E and in some cases if it's if it's progressing rapidly it's better to go straight to A&E rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us okay what I'd like you to do now is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines So you can buy it from the counter, you can get piritone or chlorphenamine and you can take one tablet four milligrams um up to about six times a day okay or you can just take a one a day one whichever is your preference that's that's absolutely fine there's no no issue that should be enough to control this um if the redness in your arm spreads and you it feels hot or you know you have signs of any localized infection we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic And like I said, if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing that's we need to process that if you read it someone actually needs to be taken urgently did you have any other um queries or was there anything else that you were worried about uh no I think I think that kind of that makes me feel a bit better I guess can I get that um can I get the uh sorry the antihistamine from any shop or like does that have to be over the counter you don't need to any chemist will have it you don't need to yeah it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually than to go to buy a prescription okay okay now um on the basis of what you told me i don't think you need any allergy testing i think this is just a straightforward localized reaction to an insect bite however if it was to happen that you know this you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other no present rushes You might need to think about blood testing. I don't think we're at that moment yet, okay? So, but that's something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurrent accident. Okay. Okay, then, so we'll leave it like that for now. Okay, I'm going to leave it to some information about anaphylactic reactions, just for you to read about it. I don't want you to panic, but just for you to be aware of what the symptoms are. If those kind of things happen, get back to us. If you're feeling worried, just have a low threshold for having a chat with us sometimes the chat is all you need to calm things down okay great yeah that makes sense all right then john okay uh well we'll leave it at one come back to us if you have any further issues okay thanks i appreciate it my pleasure all right take care then all the best bye
