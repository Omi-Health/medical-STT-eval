Hi, hi, hello, I'm Dr. Jacob. Welcome to Babylon. Hello. Hi, so just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please? And your date of birth? And your address for me, please. And 28 Cricks Road, SW191EZ. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Thank you. Okay. So you mentioned in our notes that you've got some tightness. If you could tell me a bit more about it, please. Yeah, so about two to three days ago, I was running with a friend and usually I could talk to her whilst I ran, but I found myself actually short of breath. I'm not really short of breath when I'm walking, but definitely... If I'm walking briskly now, and I've use my blue inhaler but to no avail it hasn't really helped me um yeah so i'm having i'm just wheezing a bit and coughing just generally a bit short breath wheezing and coughing okay and you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler so how often are you using the blue inhaler um i think i'm just using that as a when i have symptoms yeah so um at the moment you are having shortness of breath, so are you using it every day at the moment? Yeah, and morning or evening to kind of prevent it as well. Okay, and which colour? What's the name of your preventer? It's a blue, I think in totality my history is salbutamol, clonol, cetaben and hydrocodone. that I'm taking as well okay so could you repeat that you'll be to more clennell set your bed and hydro cortisone and hydro cortisone so you have eczema also yeah what's that sorry you do have a history of eczema um my brother's asthmatic and my sister has eczema um and I've got a few issues um that I think could be eczema as well. Okay, right. So coming back to your, you know, your shortness of breath, you've mentioned your wheezy and your coughing. Are you bringing up any phlegm at all? No, I don't. I'm not coughing up much, so. Okay, no, it's future. Okay. Right, dear. And how are you using your, your clenil so are you using it every day? Um, I think I'm using that every day and this sounds beautiful, just like us and when. So how are you using the clenil? Is it twice a day? Yes. Okay. And have you ever been admitted in hospital because your, I was so bad? Um, no, I haven't. Okay. Right here. When was the last time you had an asthma attack? About three to four years ago. Three to four years ago. And what did the GP do at that time? Just encourage me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative. Okay, so you didn't have any steroids or antibiotics. Not that I can remember. Okay. Okay. Have you ever had oral steroids in the past? No. When was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse? About two years ago? Two years ago. Okay. But your asthma was pretty under control till now, isn't it? Yes, yes, in the the last week so do you do a peak flow meter at home peak flow reading where you blow into you know do you do that no um just every now and then i haven't done it over the last since i had symptoms okay so what was what was your peak flow reading when you're good like normal big flow reading I think 12 13 okay let's say it's about um 380 yeah yeah okay right so that's your normal yeah right here okay so what we need Okay, do you have any allergies at all? Um, I have a fever. Sorry, could you repeat that, please? Sorry, I have a fever. Okay, no, no any allergies to medication Okay, so you're not allergic to anything. Okay, so no allergies. Okay, excellent So what we need to do that, obviously, you haven't had an asthma chip for some time and it looks like you can be having a small small exacerbation so what I would like you to be seen by one of our GPs in the next few days in the interim what I'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when okay I'm gonna use it maximum about every two to four four hours, but you're using it that often that means looking much that you know your asthma is really bad you can use it, but that's not ideal The new the brown in your clench or the brown inhaler you can up the dose if you're using just two puffs twice a day you can increase it to four puffs twice a day Yeah, and while this is to do while you're waiting to see us now mentioned you know you're doing what you know increase the aklanil to four puffs twice a day and you're using the asthma you know the blue inhalers every two to four hours and your breathing's getting really worse then you would need to take yourself to a and you shouldn't wait for our appointment okay so when doctor sees you what we're going to do is we're going to examine your test yeah make you do the peak that we're reading so depending on what we find you might need some antibiotics or some steroids but anyway while you're at home we are going to by increasing your clonel we are increasing your steroid intake anyway okay so yeah so any questions you wanted to ask me Yeah, so book an appointment call support book an appointment you see and I will recommend that you do the face to face in the interim increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day and you'll sell but more inhalers up to every two hourly but if your breathing's getting worse and you've not seen as you take your cough to any all right right okay thank you so much for your time you're welcome take care then bye bye
