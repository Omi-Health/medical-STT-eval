Hello, my name is Dr. Kumar, one of the GPs here. Can I just get you to confirm your name and date of birth for me, please? Yeah, I'm Maria. Yeah. Date of birth? Sorry. And your date of birth? 27th. of March of 90. Again, how can I help today? So I'm having like a really, really strong headache. I don't know what is happening. I'm quite concerned. So it started in the morning. I feel like... dizzy uh my vision is a little bit blurred um like it's it's really painful and I'm getting really concerned, especially because I'm having like these changes in the vision. Okay, so it started this morning, was it a sudden onset headache? Did it come on suddenly? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, and did it come on really bad or did it start off like a slight headache and build up to a severe headache. It came like kind of suddenly and if you if 10 is the worst pain you've ever felt in your life how bad would you say the pain was between 1 and 10? Well I had the kidney stone so let's say that that's 10 um I have now maybe 5 well 6 6 probably. But it's more about me being really concerned because this is very weird. Okay, now that's fine. Have you ever had a headache before? Sorry? Have you ever had a headache like this in the past? Um, well, not really. Because it's a friend like this. Yeah, like this? No, definitely. It's something new. Okay, okay. If you had to say where across the head the headache is, is it across the front, around the back? It's in one side, the left side only. And tell me, what visual problems are you getting? My vision is quite blurred. It's really weird, like some zigzag lines. I don't know how to describe properly okay and um have you tried any painkillers for this already yeah i tried for acetaminol but it didn't work to be honest i feel exactly the same okay um okay um what time did you take the carat acetaminol how long ago was it you taking it uh well uh the Headache started like four year four hours ago, so I would say like maybe three hours ago because I couldn't spend it. Okay And your visual problems is still ongoing now Yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel a little bit a little bit I cannot stand screens But yeah, definitely and when I move like the thing is that if I if I leave bed I start to feel like even worse if I move So I just want to have my head like really not moving. Okay, okay. So what about, have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit? Oh yeah, oh, I forgot to mention, definitely, I vomit twice. Actually, as soon as the headache started, I also vomited. So initially, I thought it was something that I ate, but then the headache started to be really bad. And I still feel nausea so we i'm about to vomit very soon i think all right okay you've mentioned in the past you've had kidney stones any other medical problems sorry you've mentioned that in the past you've had kidney stones have you had any other medical problems in the past uh so uh not actually my mother has migraines I'm not sure if that's relevant and uh also i have hypothyroidism in the family so it might be i don't know i i don't know what else do you have in the family i think we got a loss in connection sorry i i think we lost connection oh can you still hear me oh let's go yeah yeah yeah you can hear me um you said you mentioned your mother has migraines. What else do you have in the family? Hypertension. Hypertension. She also has hypertension. Okay, fine. Okay. And no others relevant family history? No, not that I'm aware. And do you take any regular medications? No. Are you allergic to any medications? Not that I'm aware. Yeah, not that I'm aware. Okay, is there any chance he could be pregnant? Uh, I really doubt it. Fine. And so you're not allergic to any medications. Fine. And what were you thinking might be going on? I know you seem quite worried about it. Was there anything in particular you were worried about? Well, I'm a little bit hypochondriac, so I feel that this can be some kind of brain tumor or something because I'm like this is really the pain is so worrisome that or maybe a stroke I don't know it's it's just like you know you hear so many stories that you definitely start to wonder if I should go to A&E urgently because I might really have something serious okay okay fine Now, just another question. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs? Anything like that? No, not at all. No, no. And when you're walking, you're able to walk fine in a straight line or is your walk, are you walking a bit funny? Not really. Okay. It's really about the head. That's why I find it very weird. Okay, so just to clarify what you said, this morning you woke up and then later on in the morning about four hours ago you developed a headache um you're on the left side of the head yeah left side of the head exactly behind the eye sorry is it behind the eye is that where the pain is uh no no it's uh i don't know how to describe it but it's just like okay that's fine you've noticed that your vision is blurry there's funny lines you feel a bit nauseous you vomited twice um yes and uh you're feeling dizzy as well but you're you've got no neurological symptoms you're walking fine um and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped okay So it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine. Is that something you've heard of before? Uh, no, it's the first time. Okay. But I'm very familiar with the disease because my mother has it. So, uh, well, but I never had it. And I thought that the onset of migraine will be, you know, in much early ages. So that's why I'm not sure if migraine makes sense. Okay. So usually with migraines, they can present at different times in people's lives. So sometimes they can present as a child, sometimes they can present when they're older, and sometimes they can present, you know, even post-menopausally. So there's different ways you can get migraines. And the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head. Typical of a migraine. You've got blurry vision again, which is very typical with the nausea and vomiting. That's also typical of a migraine. Now, obviously, if the headache is really severe, and I'll suggest some medications you can try. If that doesn't work, we would want to see you as soon as possible to do like a full neurological exam as well. Oh, that's great. to make sure that, you know, there's, you know, when we do a more specific examination that everything all seems fine. I would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you, you can take some medications, maybe something like ibuprofen. Okay, so and you're saying that if this is a migraine and if I try that medication, this should go away kind of today? So yeah, so migraine, yeah, not, you know, even sooner than that, we can look at maybe half an hour to 40 minutes, depending on what your response to it is. For some people, whatever medications they take the migraine doesn't improve and and it can last from anywhere from four hours to 72 hours migraines can last um but i would tell you that doesn't sound no so what there's lots of medication treatments so there's it can be ibuprofen with an anti-sickness um so an which you can get from the pharmacy um and you also to drink a sugary um carbonated drink something like coke okay so the three of them is a good sort of cocktail to start them then we can go up the treatment ladder you can get specific migrelief medication and that's just something to try between now and when we see you to do the um to do the assessment okay assessment where we could see you today at some point okay But however, if you do take these medications and, you know, by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself, you can cancel it. You can give us a call and cancel it. Okay, sounds good. Yeah. Sounds a good plan. Any questions for me? No, thank you very much. You were very helpful. All right. Okay. Any further problems between now and your appointment, please do let us know. Okay. Yeah. Thank you very much. Okay. Bye. Bye.
