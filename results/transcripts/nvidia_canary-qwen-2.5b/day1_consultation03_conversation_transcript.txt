I just feel like I need to vomit. So I hear this. Can you tell me a bit more about the headache? Well, you know, I noticed some zigzag lines in my vision a few minutes before the headache started. My vision blurred. You know, it's just... I... yeah, pain's just horrible. It's making me feel so unwell. Okay. And I just want you to do something. Well, let's try best. Let's try and get you well soon. You mentioned this on your left-hand side. Is that right? And it started at midday a few hours ago. Yeah. Okay. Did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more of a gradual build up no really it just happened okay and are you able to describe what kind of headache it was for example was it throbbing or was it more of a sharp pain yeah i guess it's yeah i guess it's throbbing um on that left side and is it moving anywhere else at all no but it's worse when i move Okay, is that when you move your neck? Well, like if I lean forward or like move my head or neck. Yeah, the headache gets worse. Okay. I'm just really worried that I've just been Googling and like I've read that, you know, if you're, you get headache, it gets worse when you move. It could be a sign of brain cancer. Okay. Is that what you're worried about? Is that what your main worry is today? Oh yeah, yeah, and I've like, you know, my my friend's mum, she she recently died of a brain tumor, so it's really concerning me actually. Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that, I can understand why it's affecting you. But why do we take a good history first and let me examine you and then we can have a little chat afterwards and see what's going on there. so you mentioned a few things you mentioned headaches you also mentioned some zigzag lines uh before the headaches came on and your vision has been blurry as well is that right is that on a new is that on both eyes or just the left left eye and it feels like it's on both both eyes okay have you had any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all yeah well i'm wearing i'm wearing sunglasses right now because just you know light's really hurting my eyes Oh, I see, okay um and you mentioned that you felt quite noughts have you vomited at all yeah I vomited twice twice okay and this earlier today okay um any temperatures or fevers um no I don't feel feverish okay um any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed No, I haven't noticed anything like that okay um point um and do you normally get headaches i'm not really prone to them no no but i did i did have a similar headache a few weeks ago okay and what happened then just similar how long did it last for a couple of days did you do anything that made it better Yeah, yeah, I had to take painkillers and had to sort of go to bed and rest and yeah, a couple days off work and I work in the fashion industry and you know, they're wondering what's going on, like how to take sick days. Yeah, I need to get back to work today, but you know, what if it is a brain tumor? What's gonna happen with my future, my career? You know, it's very... about this never had headaches like this before like why should get now yeah sure and I can see your concerns obviously there's a lot there's a lot of worry there um but you know let's take a step by step um and see exactly what the causes headaches are first um I'm just gonna ask you some um very uh yes no questions that's okay um um um have you noticed any problems with your speech at all any difficult with your words no any problems with your arms and legs for example numbness or weakness right and you typically balance your balance or coordination right okay and have you had any injuries to your head have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head right okay all right um and and you're feeling otherwise okay so for example your um uh your breathing is okay you're not feeling breathless or no okay um do you have any other medical history i should be aware of no no so for example if you had if someone told you've had migraines in the past no no okay do you know my mum my mum has has migraines but I don't think I'm diagnosed. Right, so my next question was about family history. Is there anything in the family? So apart from migraines, is there anything else? Anything related to the brain? What was that, sir? My mum has an underactive thyroid as well. Underactive thyroid as well. Okay, um, okay, any other problems, for example, the brain or, um, you mentioned brain cancer, any other family history of that? No, no, okay. Um, in terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis? I take the pill, Microgynon. Okay, and how long have you been on that for? Three months. Three months, okay. And is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else? It's for contraception. Okay, all right. That's something we may need to have a little discussion about today as well. My next question was about your social or your situation at home. You mentioned you work in a fashion industry. Is your job quite stressful at the moment? Yeah, it's really stressful, actually. It's having to fight people at work. You know, managers like putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver and, oh, yeah, it's not a good time. Is it getting you down? I don't feel down, just feel a bit stressed. Okay, all right. And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally i think really okay do you do much in a way of exercise no okay um who's at home with you um i live on my own okay um are you coping okay at the moment fine yeah okay and do you smoke it's all you know and do you drink much in a way of alcohol no Okay. All right. So normally at least I'd like to kind of proceed to examination. But based on your story, I wonder whether you may may have a migraine, a migraine type headache. It sounds very classical of that nature, the headache on one side throbbing nature the nausea vomiting sensitive to bright lights uh i'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious such as meningitis or indeed brain cancer and that was a big worry of yours initially thank you uh thanks so much i was so worried that i had cancer and oh Now you say migraine. Yeah, I guess my mum had similar symptoms to me and yeah yeah that makes sense well I hope that puts you all you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know does that sound to you?
