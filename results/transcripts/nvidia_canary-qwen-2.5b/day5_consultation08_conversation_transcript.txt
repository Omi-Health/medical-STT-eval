And at the moment, are you feeling short of breath when you're sitting still or just not able to walk? Just walk or sometimes but currently I feel well. Are you able to get up and down the stairs? Okay. Yeah. Right, okay. and did you say you were finding it hard to complete your sentences yeah sometimes okay um yeah yeah right okay um i mean it sounds like you've had a flare-up of your asthma It could be triggered by if there's more pollen around or there may be you may have a viral infection causing it to get worse. Did you say you checked your temperature already? Yes, I checked. Was it normal? Yeah, yeah. What was your temperature? 37. Yeah. Okay, that's fine. um have you got an aspirin inhaler at home? Yeah Okay, so what I would suggest is you take it more regularly than you are doing at the moment Have you got a spacer at home? Um Do you want to show me how to do it or somehow? Um, do you have a spacer at home? no okay um what i can do is i can prescribe you a peak flow meter so we can check your breathing level and a spacer to use your inhaler a bit more efficiently which the pharmacist can show you how you use that when you pick it up yeah sure um and if you increase it so you're taking it two to four puffs like every four hours. Initially, if you get a high temperature or your wheezing is getting worse, you need to call us back straight away so we can just advise you further with that. Okay. And it would be a good idea when you're feeling better if we could arrange just a review just to see how your asthma is because we may need to start some other medication for you. okay sounds good you have a range of review in a week or so um but but before that and if you're if you're feeling worse in a week right okay okay and the other thing to do would be to take a regular antihistamine which you can get from the pharmacy i can put a question on your notes about what to take Yeah, that would be helpful. And then if you, when you get the peak flow meter, if you can take, the pharmacist can show you how to use it. And if you could record a value, first thing when you wake up in the evening over the next week, and then we can discuss that over the phone when we look at the figures and see whether you need to go on another inhaler as well. Oh, awesome. Thank you. Have you got any questions um no that's fine yeah thank you very much thanks to that bye
