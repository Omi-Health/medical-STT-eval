Hello. Hello. Hello there. It's, uh, Dr. Sued here. How can I help you this afternoon? Oh, I've just got this terrible headache since midday. Um, on the left side. It's just making me feel so ill. I just feel like I need to vomit. I'm sorry to hear that. Um, can you tell me a bit more about the headache? Well, you know, I've noticed some zigzag lines in my vision a few minutes before the headache started. Mm-hmm. My vision's blurred. Um, (sighs) you know, it just... I, yeah, pain's just horrible. Just making me feel so unwell. Um... Hmm, okay. And ... I've been freaking out at work and I just want you to do something. Well, let's try our best. Let's try and get you, let's try and get you well soon. Um, you mentioned it's on your left hand side, is that right? And it started at midday, a few hours ago? Yeah. Okay. Um, did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more of a gradual buildup? I don't know really. It just happened. Okay. And are you able to describe what kind of headache it was? For example, was it throbbing or was it more of a sharp pain? Yeah, I guess it's... Yeah, I guess it's throbbing, um, on that left side. And is it moving anywhere else at all? No, but it's worse when I move. Okay. Is that when you move your neck? Well, like, if I lean forward or, like, move my head or neck, yeah, the headache gets worse. Okay. Um... I'm just really worried. Like, I've just been googling and, like, I've read that, you know, if your h- h- headache gets worse when you move, it could be a sign of brain cancer. Okay. You know? Is that what you're worried about? Yeah. Is that, is that what your main worry is today? Oh, yeah, yeah. And I've, like, you know... My, my friend's mum, she, she recently died of a, of a brain tumor, so it's really concerning me actually. Oh, dear. I'm sorry to hear that. I can, I can understand why it's affecting you. Um, but why, w- why don't we, why don't we take a good history first and let me examine you, and then we can have a little chat afterwards and see what's going on here. Okay. Um, so you mentioned a few things. You mentioned the headaches and you also mentioned some zigzag lines, uh, before the headaches came on. And your vision has been blurry as well. Is that right? Is that on the l- Yeah. Is that on both eyes or just the left, left eye? It feels like it's on both. Both eyes? Okay. Have you had any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all? Yeah, well, I'm wear- I'm wearing sunglasses right now 'cause it's just, you know, light's really hurting my eyes. Oh, I see. Okay. Um, and you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous. Have you vomited at all? Yeah. I vomited twice. Twice? Okay. And this earlier today? Mm-hmm. Okay. Um, any temperatures or fevers? Um, no, I don't feel feverish. Okay. Um, any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed? No, I haven't noticed anything like that. Okay. Um, that's fine. Um, and do you normally get headaches? Um, not really prone to them, no. No, but I did, I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago. Okay. And what happened then? Just similar. How long did it last for? Couple of days. Did you do anything that made it better? Um, yeah, I had to take painkillers and had to sort of go to bed and rest and- Yeah. ... had couple days off work and I work in the fashion industry and, you know- Mm-hmm. ... they're wondering what's going on. Like, I had to take sick days. Yeah, no wonder. I had to even get back to work today, but, you know, what if it is a brain tumor? What's gonna happen with my future and my career? Yeah. You know- Yeah. ... I mean, I'm just really concerned about this. There's a lot- I've never had headaches like this before. Yeah. Like, why should I get now? Yeah, sure. I mean, I can see your concerns. Obviously, there's a lot, there's a lot of worry there. Um, but, you know, let, let, let, let's, let's take it step by step, um, and see exactly what the cause of these headaches are first. Um, I'm just gonna ask you some, um, very, uh, yes, no questions, if that's okay, ma'am. Um, um, have you noticed any problems with your speech at all? Any difficulty with your words? No. Any problems with your arms and legs? For example, numbness or weakness? No. Any difficulty with balance, your balance or coordination? No. Okay. And have you had any injuries to your head? Have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head? No. Okay. All right. Um, and, and you're feeling otherwise okay? So for example, your, um, uh, your, your breathing's okay? You're not feeling breathless or... No? Okay. Um, do you have any other medical history I should be aware of? No. No? Don't think. So for example, have you had, has anyone told you if you've had migraines in the past? No. No, okay. Do you take- My mum, my mum has, has migraines, but I've- Okay. ... I've not been diagnosed. Right. Oh, my next question was about family history. Is there anything in the family? So apart from migraines, is there anything else, anything related to the brain, for example. Thyroid as well. What was that, sorry? My mum has an underactive thyroid as well. Oh, underactive thyroid as well. Okay. Um, okay, any other problems, for, for example, the brain or, um, you mentioned brain cancer. (smacks lips) Any other family history of this? No. No. Okay. Um, in terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis? Um, I take the pill, Microgynon. Okay. And how long have you been on that for? Um, three months. Three months? Okay. And is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else? Uh, it's for contraception. Okay. All right. That's something we may need to have a little discussion about today as well. Um, uh, well, my next question was about, um, your social, really your situation at home. You mentioned you work in a fashion industry. Is your work, is your job quite stressful at the moment? Yeah, it's really stressful actually.... I'm having problems with, like, people at work. You know, my manager's, like, putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver and, uh, yeah, it's not a good time. Is it getting you down? I don't feel down, just feel a bit stressed. Okay, all right. And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally? Nothing really. Okay. Do you do much in the way of exercise? No. No? Okay. Um, who's at home with you? Um, I live on my own. Okay. Um, are you coping okay at the moment? Fine. Yeah? Okay. Uh, do you smoke at all? No. Not at all? And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No. Okay, all right. Um, so normally at this, I'd like to kind of proceed to your examination. Um, but, um, based on your story, um, I wonder whether you may, um, may have a migraine, a- a mi- migraine-type headache. Uh, it sounds, um, very classical of that, of that nature. The, the, the s- headache on one side, the throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, um, sensitivity to bright lights. Uh, I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious, such as meningitis or, indeed, brain cancer. I know that was one... A big worry of yours initially. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Uh- Oh, thanks so much. I was so worried that I had cancer and... Oh, now you say migraine, yeah, I guess my mum had similar symptoms to me and- Yeah. Yeah, it does make sense. Okay. Well, I hope that puts your, your know, your mind at ease. Um, certainly this is the second h- migraine you've had in the space of a month, um, so I think moving forwards, there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary will be quite important, uh, to see exactly what's triggering these headaches. But we should also try and treat your headaches today with some strong painkillers would be advisable. So, you know, think about paracetamol or even co-codamol, um, and some anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen and naproxen. How does that sound to you? Okay, that sounds good. Um, and, uh, you know, if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we could maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place, something... You know, prophylactic medicines. Okay. And we can have a discussion next time I see you, next week perhaps. Okay. Okay? Um, now, the couple of things I want you to think about is, you know, if your symptoms aren't getting better in the next two, three days, or indeed are getting worse, I'd like you to come back and see me, um, straight away if possible. So if your headache's getting worse and not responding to medications, or your, um, your neck pain is getting worse, or you're developing any weakness in your arms and legs, or your vision, then I want you to come back and see me straight away. Okay? Okay. Does that sound all okay? Doctor, that's great. Great. Any questions for me? No. Thank you. Okay. Have a good day. Okay, thanks. Bye. All right.
