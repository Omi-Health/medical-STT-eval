Oh, hello. Hello. I'm Dr. Geraty. Oh. Oh, sorry. No, that's fine. Yeah. Can I take your full name, date of birth, and your home address, please? Uh, yeah. It's, uh, (audio distorts) 5, um, Kings Place. And are you in a, uh, and your date of birth? Uh, it's the 20th of the fourth, 1990. Okay. And are you in a private place so you can have a confidential consultation today? Yes, I am. What can I do for you today? Um, I've got a really bad headache. Had it for about a day now. Okay. And can you just tell me about how it started? What were you doing when it came on? Um, yeah. Just, um, since yesterday morning since I woke up, really, um, just, yeah, kind of throbbing headache. Haven't really wanted to leave the house much since then. Okay. And whereabouts in your head is the pain? Uh, mainly on the left side. Okay. And what does it feel like? Um, it just kind of feels like it's throbbing. It's quite intense, sort of comes and goes. Um, yeah, quite sensitive to light. Okay. Um, yeah, quite painful. When, when you say it comes and goes, does it completely go away? Uh, just kind of fades. So it's still there a little bit, but kind of gets more or less severe. Okay. And any, any other symptoms that you've had? Any problems with your eyes or your eyesight? Uh, no, not at all. Any abnormal smells or tastes? No. Any, any nausea, vomiting? Uh, no, no. Been feeling fine, actually. And have you been eating and drinking okay? Yeah, yeah. Same as normal. Okay. And normally, do you get any headaches? Uh, no, not really. It's not something I've ever had before. Okay. And has it occurred at a particular time in your menstrual cycle? Um, no, not particularly. Today I am. My period was about a week ago. Right. Okay. And how were you the day before it came on? Have you had any other symptoms like feeling feverish, temperature, any runny nose, sore ears? No, not really any sort of cold symptoms. I was doing okay the day before. Okay. And at the moment, how are you feeling? Um, it's still pretty bad. Um, yeah, still this kind of throbbing. Yeah. Have you had any changes in your skin? No, skin's been fine. Have you checked your temperature at all? Have you got a thermometer at home? Um, I haven't. Um, I don't feel like I'm feverish, but I haven't checked. And any problems with weakness, tingling, numbness in your arms or legs? No, not at all. And what have you been doing since it came on? Have you been able to go to work or have you been at home? Um, taken some painkillers, mainly been at home. Um, yeah, just kind of, kind of seems to be worse when I'm in a light room or like sunlight, so I've kind of just been staying in as much as possible. Okay. Does it get worse with any position that you're on? Does it worse when you lie flat or when you bend forward? Um, no. I think I've generally been lying down. Seems to be better that way. Any problems if you cough or sneeze? Uh, no, but I haven't really got a cough or anything. Okay. Um, can you just tell me a bit about your medical history in the past? Have you had any significant medical problems, any hospital admissions, operations, anything like that? Uh, no, not recently. Nothing. Do you take any medication? Uh, no. Just contraception. And which contraception do you take? Uh, Mifepristone, um- When did you start that one? Uh, about six years ago. Do you get any side effects from it? Um, not really. Um, no, not too much. Okay. And anyone in your family had any medical problems? Uh, my mom had, uh, high blood pressure and she's got a history of migraines. Okay. Um, so it affected me before. And have you had your blood pressure checked for recently? Uh, I haven't actually, no. Have you had it checked when you've had the repeat prescription done? Yeah, yeah, so I probably about six months ago. Do you know if there's been any problems with it? Um, it's always been fine, I think. Okay. Um, and whereabouts, whereabouts do you live at the moment? You can give me your address. Uh, just with housemates. Um, just friends. Okay. And do you drink much alcohol day to day? Um, I'd say a normal amount. Um, probably, you know, a few drinks at the weekend. Okay. And do you smoke? No. Do you take any other drugs of any sort? No. Um, so, so what, what tablets did you say you've been taking already? Sorry? What tablets have you been taking already for it? Uh, just paracetamol. Um, I'm allergic to aspirin, so I haven't been taking that. What happens when you get, uh, when you take aspirin? Um, I just feel really sick. Okay. And have you ever taken any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen, Naproxen, anything like that? Um, I have in the past. I haven't been taking it last few days. Okay. Um, so this headache is new to you and you've, you've not had regular headaches before? Yeah. What I would suggest is taking, um, some anti-inflammatories along with a paracetamol. Okay. Um, as, uh, you said you're eating okay? Yeah, yeah. Fine. I mean, it, from the sounds of it, it does sound quite like a migraine, but obviously you've had no history of that in the past. Um, and has anything changed recently or any, anything you've done recently might have triggered it? Uh, not that I can think of. Um, maybe been a bit stressed out at work, that kind of thing. But, yeah. Um, well, that would be the first thing to do, is to take some anti-inflammatories along with a paracetamol. Make sure you're really well hydrated, um, and see how that goes. And if it, if it isn't settling or it's getting worse or you get any other change in your headache, um, or you're unwell with it with a high temperature, then we would certainly need to speak to you straight away about that. The other thing is if you, if you're getting persistent, um, headaches or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle or certain things seem to trigger these headaches, then it, it would be worth having a further discussion about it to see whether we can work out if we can help that, that longer term. Okay, brilliant. Thank you. Um, I would try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked if you haven't had it checked for a while. Okay. Sure. Uh, and thing to do is to have a thermometer at home so you can make sure that your temperature's okay? Yep. If you have a raised temperature or your headache's just getting worse and you develop any rashes or anything like that, then we'd need to speak to you straight away. Yep, okay. That's brilliant. Okay. So I'll take some ibuprofen and I'll, um, hopefully be a bit better in a day or two then. So, yeah. Okay. So have you got any other questions? Uh, no, that was it today. Okay. Okay, then. We'll, we'll, we'll, um, speak to you again. Okay. Brilliant. Thanks so much. Thanks so much. Bye. Bye.
