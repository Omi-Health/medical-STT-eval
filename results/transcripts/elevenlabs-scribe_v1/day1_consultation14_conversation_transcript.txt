Hello? Hello. Hi, there. Um, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your date of birth? Uh, yeah. Uh, my name is April and I'm 50. You're 50? Okay. April, how can I help you this afternoon? Well, I've just been having this, like, cough for quite a few days, and my nose is running. Um, and it's just been super annoying and it's not going away. No idea. Okay. When did it all start? Uh, I think it started, like, maybe a bit less than a week ago, like maybe, maybe five or six days ago. Okay. And you mentioned a couple of things there. You mentioned a cough, you mentioned a bit of a runny nose. That right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Let's focus on your cough first. Can you tell me a bit more about your cough? Uh, it's just so continuous. It's really, really frustrating. It's quite dry and it's just all day. Like, keeps me up at night as well, which is really annoying. Okay, so it's a dry cough. So you're not bringing up any- Yeah. ... you're not bringing up any............................ Oh, I can hear that. Yeah. Um, you're not bringing up any, uh, mucky phlegm or anything like that? No. No. Okay. So it keeps you up at night. Um, you mentioned, uh, the cold symptoms as well, the runny nose. Do you have a s- do you have a sore throat at all? I mean, apart from... I mean, the coughing is giving me a sore throat. But it's not like... You know, not more than, than that. You know, just, just my throat is irritated from coughing. Mm-hmm. But it's not like... It's not that bad when I swallow or anything. Right. Do you have any, uh... Do, do... Are you... How are your ears? Your ears feel blocked or... No, they feel okay actually. Yeah. No pain or distress around your ears? No. No pain, no pain on the ears. Okay. All right. Um, fine. In terms of your breathing, um, how is your breath... How's your chest? Is your breathing more labored? Um, I don't think so. Like, I guess, like, it's labored when I'm coughing and I can't breathe. But, like, not... Yeah, no, I, I don't think so. Not- Like today, when you walk around, uh, you don't feel breathless, do you? I don't feel breathless. Okay. No. I, it, I feel, you know, generally tired. Okay. Okay. But, like... Yeah, but n- not, not anything special with my chest. Any pain in your chest? No, not, not that either. Okay. You mentioned feeling tired. Um, have you felt feverish at all? Have you had a temperature? Uh, I'm having, like, like, shivers even when I'm in... when I'm in bed, you know, like, when you, when you go to sleep and, and you feel like, "I, I should be warm but I'm still, still, you know, shivering a little bit." Okay. But I haven't taken my temperature, so I'm not 100% sure if I had a fever. But it feels like I probably did, because I was just... I was next to my boyfriend and he was completely warm and totally fine. Mm-hmm. And I just, like, couldn't stop shivering. Mm-hmm. And kept adding more sweaters on and I was still cold. No idea. Okay. Okay. All right. Um, fine. In terms of any other symptoms, have you had any nausea? Have you had any vomiting? No. No, no nausea, no vomiting. Okay. But, um, yeah, no- nothing like that. How's your appetite? Um, I mean, it's okay. I... At the beginning, like, when I was starting to have the sy- the symptom- the, the coughing and stuff, um, I had a little bit of diarrhea. Um, but, but I didn't... It didn't cut my appetite or anything. Okay. I just, like... My stomach wasn't feeling great. Okay. Has that got better now, the diarrhea? Yeah, yeah. It got better. It was only, like, the first... Like, it started at the same time as the cough started. And then it stopped, so I thought everything would be fine. Okay. But then the cough's just kept going. Okay, fine. Um, any problem with your water works at all? With my what? Uh, your w- your water works, your urine. Oh. Uh, no. No, no. It's fine. You're passing urine okay? You're drinking plenty of fluids and passing urine okay? Yeah. I, I drank loads of water when I started having the diarrhea. Now that it's stopped, I just went back to normal. Okay. All right. Um, in terms of any other things, do you notice any funny skin rashes or, um, problems with your muscles or joints? Uh, like, my... You know, when I had the... When I was telling you I had, like, the... I had chills and I was really cold. Mm-hmm. My muscle was really hurting. Okay. So I'm trying to do Pilates. But, like, it's hurting me so much at the moment. Right. Um, so to be honest, all I feel like doing is just lying in bed. Right. Okay. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. That must be really difficult for you. Yeah. It's not great. Okay. Especially, like, in my arms, my legs. Like, just everywhere basically. Feeling quite lethargic and weak, you mentioned. Yeah. Pretty much. Okay. And, uh, um, April, are you normally otherwise fit and well? Am I normally what? Uh, fit and well. So do you have any other medical history? Uh, well, I have type 2 diabetes. Okay. And I have quite high blood pressure. Okay. And what do you take for your blood pressure? Any... Or what medications do you take on a regular basis, should I say? Um, I take met- Metformin for the diabetes. Yep. And I take Lisinopril for the high blood pressure. Lisinopril, okay. Right. Any allergies at all to medication? No. No allergies. No. Okay. Regarding any family history, is there anything I should be aware of? Uh, my dad also has type 2 diabetes, but I think that's it. Okay. All right. Who's looking after your diabetes? Is there anyone... Do you have a doctor in hospital who looks after your diabetes? Uh, yeah. I just regularly go see a doctor, um, who just checks up on it. Same with the high blood pressure. Like, I, I have it under control. And since I started taking this medication, I've just been, like, regularly checking that it's, it's under control. Right. Excellent. In terms of your social situation, who lives at home with you? Uh, just... It's just me and my partner. Okay. Um, fine. Is your partner well at the moment? Yeah. He has none of this. Like, he's just going ahead like, like nothing, nothing. Like, I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him, but... Right. Okay. So far, not, uh, diarrhea, nothing. He's fine. Got away... He's got away with it at the moment? Yeah. Okay. (laughs) And, uh, are you working at the moment, April?Uh, yeah, I am working. But the, the first day I skipped 'cause, 'cause I was feeling just too shit. Yeah. Um, but then I just felt like I had to go back 'cause I had so much to do. Mm-hmm. And so I've been going in, but it's not been fun. No, I can imagine. What is it that you do for work? Uh, I am a developer. Oh, so you work in the IT field. Okay. Um, yeah, work in IT. IT field, right. Okay. Um- But it's not too active a job. No. Um- Have you been quite stressful recently? Not more than usual. I don't think it's related to stress. Like, I, I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work currently. Great. Um- The reason I ask is sometimes- ... I've been able to take a day off to try and recover, so yeah, I don't think it's related. The reason I ask is sometimes stress can really affect your immune system. Um, but, uh, it's good to know you're, you're, you're not feeling stressed. Um, do you smoke at all, April? I used to, but I've stopped for about six months now. Okay. Um, and what about alcohol? I mean, yeah, I, I don't think I drink that much. Like, I, I don't really know how you count the units, but I guess, like, I don't drink more than, like, like, s- say three evenings a week, and I rarely get, like, properly drunk or anything. And what is it that you drink? Wine, mostly. The wine. And how much do you drink on those nights? Uh, I'd say, like, maybe two or three glasses. Okay. So, um, yeah, so you're probably just about under the limit of, um, the recommended limit. Something for you to think about, just because of your blood pressure and diabetes, maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can. Yeah? Your overall- How much do you think I should cut down on it? Well, uh, really, ideally the, the, the right answer is to cut down completely. But, uh, in practice I know that's not realistic. So maybe for the first few weeks, why don't you cut down to two glasses a week, and then one week thereafter? Um, and if you are coping okay, then we can maybe try and cut down all together. Okay. Okay. Just something for you to think about. Yeah. Um, right. So, uh, just con- as we wrap up, really, um, April, I think based on your story, I think, uh, essentially I think you're, you're going through a bit of a, bit of a viral illness. Um, I don't think there's anything to worry about. You know, you've had bit of a cough, bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic. I'm hoping that, you know, you're probably over the worst of it now. It's been five days. I'm hoping you're maybe gonna get better the next couple of days. It normally lasts about a week to 10 days. What, what should I do if it just keeps going on and on, like if it's still going on in, in, say, four days? Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to, you know, get some nice good rest, drink plenty of fluids, keep yourself well-hydrated. You can take a regular paracetamol. If you feel like it's still not getting any better in two to three days, it's probably worth coming back to see me again. We can check you over. And if you are still feeling feverish, um, and your cough isn't getting any better, then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest, which can sometimes be a, a common source of infection. Um... Do you think I should keep going to work, or do you think I should just... Yeah, so I think you may... Uh, really, I think it depends on you. It's, um, if you are coughing, then there is a the- uh, you know, a risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still. So I would say maybe take a day or two off work if you can, uh, get some good bed rest, um, and maybe think about work early next week. Okay. Okay. But, um- Thank you. ... if your cough isn't getting any better or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner, okay? Okay, but otherwise I don't need to worry. No, no, nothing, nothing to worry about otherwise. Okay. Okay? All right. Thank you very much. All right. Have a good day. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bye.
