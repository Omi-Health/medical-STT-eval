Um, would you i- be happy to call the support line and arrange that appointment? Yes. Okay. That's fine. So we'll, we'll do that. In the meantime, if it gets a lot worse, um, or you, you're not holding any fluids down, um, then we should see you before then. Um, did you say your pregnancy test was a month ago? Yes. Okay. Um, and your Implanon was just put in a year ago? Yes. The other thing we would need to do is to, to do a pregnancy test today if possible. I will do it. So if you can do that today and if it's positive we need to see you straightaway, so give us a call back. Yes. Okay? Have you got any other questions? No, no, nothing. Right. Okay.
