... next door. Hello? Hello. Hi. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, I can hear you. Hi. Right. Excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age for me? Sure. Um, I'm Amanda Jackson and I'm 19 years old. 19 years old. Okay, Amanda. And how can I help you this a- afternoon? Um, so it's been going on for a few days now. Um, it's not happened before and I'm a bit worried. I- I've c- It hurts when I kind of pee. Um, and yeah, it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more. Um, and it's really... Like, I can't like go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. Oh, dear. Um, and it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm... Like, in, uh, the bottom of my tummy as well. Right. Okay. I'm sorry to hear. There's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you. Um, so you mentioned it's been going on for the last three days. Mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. Um, did you say you're going to the toilet more often as well? Is that right? Uh, yeah. It's been going on for a little bit longer than three days, I think, actually. Maybe just under a week. Oh, under a week. Sorry about- Um- Okay. Uh- Sorry. No, I, I didn't explain it properly before. Mm-hmm. Um, yeah. No, I... It's been going on for about just under a week. Good. And then what- Um, and yeah, I noticed a sort of burning, stinging when I, when I go to the toilet. So, yeah. Have you noticed any, anything in your urine. For example, any blood or, um, discoloration of urine? Um, I think, well, today I noticed, um, that it was like a bit pink. All right. The, the urine. Okay. Cool. Yeah. The only thing just today. And have you noticed any of, any kind of frank blood? I mean, red blood at all in your urine? Um. Or it's- I think it was mixed in probably. I don't know. It was pink, so... Okay. Okay. Um, fine. Well, we'll have to definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on. Um, you also mentioned some tummy pain as well. Can you tell me a bit more about that pain? Yeah. It's kind of at the bottom of my tummy. Um, uh, mainly when I go to the loo, I think that's when it's worse. Okay. Um, can you describe, is it crampy pain? Is it more of a burning pain? Um, I wouldn't describe it as crampy. I don't think it's like a period pain. Okay. It's a bit different. It's, it's hard to say. An achy pain, I suppose. An achy pain. Okay. And does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back, towards your sides? Um, no, no. Okay. All right. Um, any other symptoms at all, like for example nausea, vomiting? Nope. No nausea, vomiting. Okay. Any temperatures or fevers? Um, no. No, not that I've noticed. Okay. All right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working okay? Uh, I, I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any different- Okay. ... than what it usually is. When we say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have? Um, I think I have, um, IBS. Um, so I just- Okay. ... kind of pass, uh, my bowels like quite, quite a lot. Um, and sometimes it's quite, it's quite variable. Like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit... It's, sorry this is a bit disgusting but like- Uh, no. That's all right. ... sometimes it's a bit, um- We all are a bit. ... harder and it's kind of hard to predict. Okay. All right. But- Like- ... but you've noticed no new symptoms? No, no, no new symptoms in your bowels? Uh- No, no, not that I can think of today. Okay. All right. Um, and Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions, as you can imagine. Um, uh, can I ask, are you currently, uh, are you currently sexually active at the moment? Uh, y- uh, yeah. Um, I have a, a long-term, um, boyfriend. Okay. And, um, have you noticed any other discharge from down below? So from, from the front passage? Mm. No. No, I don't think so. Okay. Nothing unusual. Okay. Have you... Do you use any form of contraception? Uh, yeah. Uh, I'm, um, on the pill. On the pill. What kind of pill? Is it a combined pill or the mini-pill? A combined pill. Okay. Fine. Um, when was the last time you had, um, unprotected sex? If you don't mind me asking you. Uh, uh, I mean, I mean, unprotected as in like no, no condoms or anything? Yeah, exactly. Um, I, I guess 'cause, uh, I m- I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend. We just like... I don't know, we've just kind of agreed. Uh, so, uh, I guess- Yeah. ... a week ago. A week- Two weeks ago something. Okay. All right. Quite, quite recently. And what I'm trying to get at is whether, um, uh, there's any chance you could be pregnant at all. Uh, I know you're on the pill but, uh, we, we, nonetheless we do have to ask. Um, when was your last, when was your last period? Um, two weeks ago. Two weeks ago. Okay. All right. Just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better, okay? Mm-hmm. Um, fine. In terms of your general health otherwise, at the moment are you, uh, eating and drinking okay? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Eating and drinking okay. Um, I did have one kind of concern. I don't know- Mm-hmm. So I smoked... Uh, this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time, uh, like a week and a half ago. I d- I just wonder whether it's related at all. Probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. Sure. Well, thanks for sharing with me. Um, so I, I don't think it's p- is related to your symptoms. I think it's probably just- Okay. ... pure, pure coincidence. Um, but, uh, you know, I do strongly advise you to, you know, um, make it a regular habit if you can, um, just for- Okay. ... just for your general health moving forwards. Okay? Um- Mm-hmm. Fine. Moving on. In terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions? Uh, apart from IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of? Nope. Nope? Okay. Great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the, um, combined pill?Apart from the pill, um, I take, um, something for the IBS as well. Um, it begins with an M. It's really hard to pronounce, like me- mebes- Mebez- ... something. Is that really what it is? Maybe. Maybe. Yep. Okay. Yeah, yeah. That's it. Yeah, yeah. That's right. Okay. And is that for the cramps, the crampy pain? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications? Um, yeah, I think there was an antibiotic, um, called Clindas- clindamycin- Mm-hmm. ... -licin- Okay. Okay. ... that I took like a couple years ago or something and yeah, that, that didn't go too well- Right. ... with me. Okay, sure. I'll make a note of this. Um, in terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? Nope. Nope. Nope. Not really anything else. Good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? Um, so I am living in halls at the moment, uh, at uni. Um, so, uh, I'm just living with a flatmate, I suppose. Good. Um, but my family, uh, live kind of outside of London, not too far away. Um, so yeah, my family are fine and I see them now and then. Good. Very good. Uh, yeah, things are, I think, I think okay, generally. Great. And what are you studying at university? I'm studying, uh, English. English? Okay, good. And how are you enjoying your course? Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's going well, thanks. Just- Good. ... kind of started a few months a- a few months ago. And yeah, I really enjoy it. Very good. Yeah, yeah. It's really fun. Very good. Good. Um, in terms of smoking and alcohol, do you, do you participate in either? Uh, as I admitted before, I tried weed for the first time, uh, but I don't smoke. Uh, I drink occasionally. Good. Um, kind of socially- Okay. ... um, with friends. Okay. And what, what made you have your first joint last week? Was that- Um, I, it was just a party. Mm-hmm. Um, there were other people doing it. Um, I kind of was a little bit tipsy, so (laughs)- Good. ... probably wasn't thinking quite straight. Um, but yeah, I, I completely agree, it's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure. And obviously as your doctor says he has to look after you, so I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid it. Sure. Great. Um, fine. So at this stage, I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think, um, you know, I'm, I'm reassured by the fact... I, I, I think it's, um, probably just a simple, what we say a UTI or a cystitis, bladder infection. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um, you know, you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about. So things like fevers and back pain, um, would be- Mm-hmm. ... more worrying for me to hear. Um, so something we, we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. Um- Mm-hmm. ... so we've got a choice of two antibiotics, something called trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin, which is a three-day course. Mm-hmm. Normally they're usually quite effective, um, for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample- Mm-hmm. ... as well if you can, so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly- Okay. ... what's going on there. Um, start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids. Um- Yeah. ... if you are having some pain, simple paracetamol, um, would probably be advisable. Okay. Um, we'll see what the urine sample shows. Um, and if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. Um, but if things are still not getting any better next week, come back and see me and we can have another look again. Okay. Okay. Uh, great. Um, with, with the urine sample, um, how do I go about doing that? So I'll give you- You know, is it through a catheter? ... ah, yeah, no... Uh, well, let's see. Good question. So I will give you... I will organize, uh, for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices, um, which we can test there and then- Okay. ... with a urine test and send it off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results. Okay, perfect. Okay. Great. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call. Okay? Fever, back pain and vomiting. Great. Okay. Yeah. I'll remember those. Yeah. Okay. Have a good day. Okay. Thank you. All right. Thank you. You too. Have a good day. Bye-bye.
