Hello. Can you hear me okay? Uh, yes, I can. Can you hear me? Yeah, good, good. So my name is Joe. I'm a doctor, um, here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? Uh, my name's Vincent. And your date of birth? Uh, uh, 9th of May, 2016. Okay, great. So- And are you in a, uh, a safe place, oh sorry, a safe and conf- confidential place to talk and just- Yeah, I am. ... happy to go ahead with the consultation? Yes. Yes, I am. Great. So how can I help? Yeah. So I have a cold that I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week, and it's been causing me problems, so I've had to stay away from work for about three or four of those days because of all that is. Oh, okay. I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week. Yes. And what came s- what came first? Uh, the sore throat came first and then after a day or two, the cough. Okay, okay. And, uh, are you coughing up anything? No. It's very dry. Okay. So I'm just gonna ask a few questions about the, uh, your current symptoms, and then a little bit about your background, um, and something that's about what we can do, uh, a little bit later on in the consultation to help you. But before we go on- Okay. ... is there anything you're particularly concerned about, um, or have any ideas what might be going on? You said that you had a cold. Well, well, I mean, you, you know how we all are. Once this happens, you Google it, and there seems to be all kinds of bad things it could be. It could be... Could be a cold or flu, obviously, but it could also be tuberculosis. It could be cancer, always comes up. So, it would be good if it's none of those. Right. So, so yeah, I can provide a little bit of reassurance, um, and, uh, we can talk about those a little bit as well. And was there anything you were particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation, um? Uh... well, uh, yeah. So reassurance, so like hopefully some sense that it's not anything too serious. But also if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better or any advice or maybe even a sick note, so that if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer I can get one. Sure, sure. Okay. All right. So we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms, and I'm sure we can get, get a, um, those things, uh, sick notes and some reassurance, um- Okay. ... about your concerns. So, um, you mentioned that you started with a sore throat about a week ago, developed into a bit of a dry cough. Yeah. Um, I'll just ask a few questions around those. So, um, do you have any shortness of breath? Yes. Yes. I've been having short- Oh, yeah, I've been having shortness of breath. Yeah. You are short of breath. And, uh, do you have any wheeze or chest pain? Uh, yeah. A bit of both, actually. You're, you're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well? Yes. Okay. And how, uh, when did you start to develop the shortness of breath? Let's see. So, so, so the sore throat... So today is Friday, the sore throat was about last week Friday or Thursday. Cough was Saturday or Sunday. So the, so the shortness of breath was I think shortly after the cough, so maybe a day or two later. So three, four days ago. Three or four days ago you started to develop And is the cough worse at nighttime? No. No, it's the same throughout the day. Same throughout the day. Um, and, uh, when you say you're short of breath, just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are. So are you able to, to get, um, to like walk up a flight of stairs, for example, um, or, or are you short of breath at rest? Uh, yeah, it's, it's like when I'm doing walking, um, and I do exercise now and then. So it, it hasn't been super bad, like, hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual and I'm a little bit worried. And you're a bit concerned about that. Okay. So I just need to ask a few, uh, things about your background as well. So, um, do you have any other medical conditions or medical history? No. Just... No. No past medical history. No. No past medical history. No history of asthma? Nope. Um, and any, uh, uh, history of, uh, clots on your legs or your lungs? So these are DVTs or PS. Uh, no one in your family's had those, clots in the legs or lungs? Well, my mother had lung cancer. Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke? No. Have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos, you know? Don't know of asbestos, never smoked. I mean, once or twice in Amsterdam, if that counts, but not really. (laughs) Okay. Um, and this... So just going back to the, your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough, it's a dry cough, no, you're not coughing up any phlegm. Um, do, do you have, uh, and you don't, you say you don't have any chest pain as such. Um, uh, are you taking any medications currently at the moment? Uh, no, I'm not. Okay. Are you allergic to any medications? Not to any medication, but I'm allergic to peanuts. Peanuts. Okay. Um, and, uh, you mentioned that your mother had, uh, lung cancer. Um, any other family history of any significant illnesses, uh, run- running in your family? No, no. That's the only one, just lung cancer from my mother. Just lung cancer. Okay. And you say you have a cold, so do you have sinus congestion or, um... No, it seems to be almost entirely with just my throat. It's not like my nose is running or Just, just your, just your throat. And any recent travel or have you always lived in the UK?Uh, no, so I, I haven't always lived in the UK. Like, so I was born in the US and moved over about 12 years ago. But in terms of recent travel, just to Europe, nowhere too exotic. Okay. So no, so no recent travel, no significant recent travel any- anywhere. Um, okay. And are you coughing up anything other than... Um, so you're not coughing up blood or anything like that? No. No. Um, good. And, uh, are you feeling feverish, hot, cold, sweaty? Yeah, so a little bit feverish, um, at first, so the first three or so days of this. But then it... the fever's gone away. Okay. And in general, do you- So I had a... Sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I was just gonna say, also had a bit of a headache. Ah. Like, headaches that come and go rather. But, like, right now it's fine. Okay. And in general, would you say you're feeling... you're, you're beginning to, to feel better, worse or, or sort of, um, staying the same? (sighs) So it's like it's up and down. So, so let's see. So I started last week and I stayed home from work two days this week. I think it was maybe Tuesday and then Thursday. So, like, I felt better and then worse again, and then better and then worse again. So it's been, yeah, like, kind of constant, but constant in being variable, if that makes sense. Okay. And I just r- need to ask any other sort of risk factors, um, that you may have. So, um, no sort of significant weight loss, um, or unexplained weight loss, any So no weight loss, but I have been, have been losing my appetite recently. And I mean, I usually eat a lot, so kind of... and I enjoy eating as well. But, like, that's been a bit concerning. You've been losing your appetite recently? Yes. And you're a little bit concerned about that. Yes. But you haven't, you haven't lost any weight that you think of? No. Not that And any, um, sort of rashes or anything, uh, on you? No. No rash. No. Okay. Um, so I would ask to examine you now, but, um, I, I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat at least to see if there's a... probably Oh, we can try if you want. Oh, no. Well, no, it's okay. O- I might think about doing it. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck that you can feel? Uh, no. Not really... No. Okay. Um, and so finally y- you were talking about, uh, t-... I mean, it sounds to me that, um, you've been a little bit up and down, sore throat, developed a dry cough. Um, you are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of the consultation now, so if you feel significantly worse, um, uh, if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness, um, or breathlessness that you are concerned about, then I would advise you to see medical attention again, see a GP, um, and actually see somebody physically. Um, uh, but I think for now, I can sort of, uh, try and reassure you that, um, if this clears up as I expect it would... So expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days. Um, if it's not, please get in touch with a medical professional again. Um, and, uh, I would expect it to, and so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis. Um, your concerns about lung cancer are... And was that the other thing you were concerned about? Uh, yeah. Yeah. R- yeah. So, so, um, again, if you're not getting better, please see somebody again. Um, I've just got four seconds now. Mm-hmm. So nice talking to you. And have we gotta... We gotta tidy up. Yeah. Okay. So, uh- All right. ... uh, and I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days off work. Um, and paracetamol, lots of fluids, um, and, uh, rest up. And as I say, if you're not feeling better, please get in touch. Okay? All right. Thanks a lot. Have a good day. Thank you. (laughs) All right.
