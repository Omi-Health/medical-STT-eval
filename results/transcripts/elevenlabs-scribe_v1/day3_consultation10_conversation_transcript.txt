Hello? Hello. Hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. So, just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please? Michael Jonathan. And your date of birth? 09/29/83. Okay. And your address for me, please? 231 Leonard, London Street, or (laughs) sorry, London. Okay. And that's correct? And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation? Yes. Okay. Uh, you've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea. I'm sorry to hear about it. So if you tell me a bit more about it, please. Uh, it's been happening for about three days now. Okay. Um, yeah, it started off, uh, it was... I don't know, it's just something that I thought would go away pretty quickly. Mm-hmm. I've had that from time to time after eating certain types of food or going on certain travels. Mm-hmm. But, uh, nothing funky in my diet or no travels recently, um, and it just kind of kept up. Mm-hmm. So I'm a bit confused as to what to do. So you haven't had anything from outside, nothing dodgy, anything like... No. No. No, no, no. Just a little bit... Yeah. I don't know. I mean, it's, it's pretty standard diarrhea where there's like a little bit of abdominal pain. I threw up once. Mm-hmm. And that was a little worrying. Uh- Can you repeat that please? That wasn't clear. What did you say? I threw up once. Once. Ah. Yeah. After that, which said something? Uh, nothing else was worrying, so... Okay. Right. And with the diarrhea, how many times a day are you going to the toilet? Uh, four to five. Four to five times. Yeah. And is there any... And it's like water? Is it like water or is it just loose? Uh, what do you mean? Are you going like water? Or is it just, you know, bit, bit of so- solid stools, bit loose kind of thing? It probably depends on the time of day, to be honest. Oh. A bit of both. Bit of both. And is there any blood or mucus? No blood. What do you mean mucus? It's like the snotty stuff. In the stool? Yeah. It looks like snot. Mucus. No. No. So no mucus. Okay. Any fever at all? Uh, maybe a little bit. Mm-hmm. But it hasn't been... That in particular hasn't been too worrying. Are you still able to eat and drink? Uh, a little bit of appetite loss, I guess, versus normal. Okay. Um, but also not something I... Like, I... If that was alone, I wouldn't have reached out. Sure. So but you're, you're still able to drink quite a bit, yeah? You're drinking plenty? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Excellent. Mostly to try and rid. Okay. And, um, what have you take- Have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea? Nothing yet. Nothing yet. Okay. Anything for the abdominal pain? Uh, nothing yet. Okay. Right. And any... Unfortunately, we don't have any of your past medical history. Is there anything you'd like to say? Uh, I probably had asthma- Mm-hmm. ... um, before. Or, I don't know, I guess I still have it. Okay. And, uh, are you... Any, anything else other than asthma? Uh, my dad had hypertension. Okay. Has hypertension. Yeah. Had hypertension. He, yeah, he died of bowel cancer 10 years ago. Oh, dear, okay, bowel cancer. 10 years ago. And how old was he when he died? Uh, 62. Okay. And, um, you mentioned you had asthma. Are you using any inhalers at all? Yes. Which ones? Lexapro. Sorry? Lexapro. Lexapro? Yes. Okay. Not heard of it. I mean, is it like salbutamol? Is it like a blue color? Yellow. Yellow. Okay. I'll have to check that one. I'm not sure. Lexapro. Okay. Um, that's fine. Any other medication that you're using, over the counter, anything at all? No. Regularly. No. Okay. Right. Any allergies? Nothing. Yeah, nothing. No allergies at all? All right here. Fine. So, obviously, you know, you just have diarrhea. It's about four to five times a day. Um, you're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated, which is a good sign. Okay? Um, when we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day. That means probably you are... You know, whatever you're eating is going straight through. Okay? You still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids. Mm-hmm. Okay? When you go to the toilet, um, things that one would advise is a soft diet. So avoid dairy, fish, meat, eggs while you're having the diarrhea. Go- Oh, yeah. Sorry?What is a soft diet? What does that m- uh, like, outside of not those things, what do you mean by soft? Okay. So that will be like crackers, toast, jam, those kind of things, that's easily digested, like what we would give babies, yeah? When they start eating, you give simple food for babies. You don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding. So that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about, yeah? Once you are able to, you know, keep most of it in, you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash. Once you're okay with that for about 48 hours, then you can start having meat. So, just don't have meat immediately- Yeah. ... once you feel like you're slightly better, because you might go back to square one again. All right? What do you mean okay with that diet? Like once... Well, 48 hours you're not having any diarrhea, you're fine, then you can go and start having meat, egg, fish, and... Okay. So that's when you- But if it's diarrhea that is getting better, but isn't getting... Or do you want it to go away completely at that point? Or if it's like trending up? No, no, no. Preferably just don't, because wh- wha- why do we say this? 'Cause because it takes much more time for meat to get digested. So because your gut flora, you know, the, the, the bacteria in your gut is not, you know, as it should be, it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food. While it doesn't take that much of an effort to, you know, digest mash and vegetables. Does that make sense? Yes. Yeah? So, um, at the same time, you could have some... Although you can't eat milk is not a good idea, yogurts are a good idea because they are probiotics. It help to build up the normal, um, gut, gut bacteria back. Okay? Okay. So those kind of... Now, things to look out for. If your diarrhea doesn't go away in a week's time or if you're passing blood, we need a stool sample because that means you m- you may have, um, um, some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics. Okay. Okay? If you are, again, as I've mentioned previously, if you're going about six to eight times a day, that means there's a high chance that, uh, you are having d- dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time. If that happens, you get in touch with us again. All right? Okay. Any questions? You look a bit confused. No, that's it. Yeah? Okay. And also, you could get something called Diaralyte over the counter. So it helps to, uh, replenish your, the salts that you've been, that's lost through going to the toilet. Okay. Okay? If you're a bit confused, you know, you can actually, uh, all of this is all recorded in your app, so you can go back. I'll put that all in detail. So if, you know, I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything, you can go back and read, read the notes. Is that- Okay. ... okay? That's great. All right then. You take care. Bye. Bye now. Bye-bye.
