Your full name, date of birth, and your address please. Yeah. My name is Barbara Cole. Yeah. Okay. Um, and my date of birth, 4th October 1984. Okay. And address, 50 Stone Avenue. Okay. Are you in a private place so you can have a confidential consultation today? Yes, I am. What can I do for you? Um, I've just been stooling for the past couple of days. I've been having this serious diarrhea and it's really giving me trouble. Okay. So when did it start? About three days ago now. Okay. And when you say diarrhea, what do you mean by that? Is it watery or just loose? It's, it's, it's very loose but it started as being very watery. Okay. And how many times are you going to the toilet? (sighs) I lost count. Um, today alone, I've been at least four times. Okay. And any, any high temperatures or are you feeling feverish? Yes, I've been running a serious temperature. I'm literally boiling. Have you checked your temperature with a thermometer? No, 'cause I've not got one, but, like, to the touch, I'm, like, literally roasting. Okay. Um, and any nausea or vomiting? Yes, I've been throwing up. I can't keep to, I can't seem to be able to keep anything in me, not even water, not even my tea, not even any liquid stuff. I've just been throwing up everything. Okay. And when, when were you last sick? Um, I was sick just after trying, uh, trying to have breakfast this morning. So maybe about two hours ago. Okay. And have you been passing water okay? Yeah, I've been, I've been, yeah, urinating okay. Is that what you mean? Like- Yeah, yeah. Urinating, yeah. Any, uh, what sort of color is the urine? To be honest, I've actually never had a look- Okay. ... so I really couldn't say. Okay. And when did you last pass urine, do you think? Um, at least an hour ago. Okay. And any blood in the stool or in the urine that you've noticed? No blood. Okay. Any episodes like this before? How's your bowels normally? Sorry, I didn't catch that one. How's your bowels normally? I, I, my, my bowels are normally fine. I would normally go to the toilet every day. (...)(00:03:32) just once. Yeah, and that's about it. Any episodes of diarrhea or constipation normally? No. And is, is there anything you think might have triggered this off? Have you been abroad anywhere? No. But then, um, my, um, my brother, um, has actually been having similar symptoms, um, for the past, um, few days as well. And he does say, like, everyone at school's got it, so I, I don't know that might, that might be it for him. So you've been in contact with him, have you? Yes. Okay. Um, and any other medical problems? Not that I'm aware of. Have you had any other symptoms at the moment, like rash? No, no rash. No, nothing like that. Okay. Um, any surgery before or abdominal problems or any other medical issues? Well, apart from the fact that this one is giving me abdominal pains, no previous abdominal pains before. Also I get the odd, um, you know, menstrual cramps and all that, but, you know, that's, you know, that comes and goes. Okay. And whereabouts is the pain that you're getting? Um, it's kind of like towards my navel area. Like, I can't touch my navel area, it's just so sore. And it gets, yeah, so it's at the center of my navel. Um, and does the pain come and go? Yes, it does come. When it comes, I feel the strong urge to go to the, to the loo, and then it sort of relieves me and sort of, like, comes again. It comes and goes. Okay. Um, and do you take any medication regularly? Well, I, I take my, my vitamins, especially vitamin D- Okay. ... every day. That's about, that's about all that I regularly take. And have you got a normal diet? Yeah, I've got a... I eat well normally. Right. Do you smoke or drink alcohol? Well, I don't smoke but, you know, I have a pint from time to time. And do you take any other drugs? No. Like I said, I only take, um, vitamins. Um, for my menstrual cramps, when it comes, maybe I might take a, uh, uh, an ibuprofen just to ease the pain. But- And when was, when was your last period? Um, two weeks ago. Okay. Are you on any contraception? No. Are you having regular sexual intercourse? No. Okay. Um, and what's your job? I'm, I'm, uh, I'm a, a graphics designer. Have you had to miss work because of this problem? Well, yes, I've had to actually work from home today. I'm working from home today because I can't, I can't be out for work. Okay. I had to miss work today. And who do you live with at home? I live with my brother and my mom. Okay. Okay. And, um, have you tried anything yourself for this problem?Well, I've tried a home remedy. Um, I've tried the, the, or- ORS, you know, thing, um, I bought from my, my local, my local, um... Um- Wha- Can you just repeat that? The ORS, the, the salt, sugar, ORS, um, um, mix. The salt-sugar mix. Okay. But- And how often have you been taking that? I've taken that, I've taken that, like, um, three times a day for the past two days. Okay. Um, and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off or getting worse or... To be honest, I, I'm, I'm, they're not getting any better, 'cause like I said, I've been, I've been vomiting literally everything I take, so- Yeah. ... so I doubt that even that has had the ch- chance to work. Okay. Um, I mean, it sounds like y- because your brother's had a similar thing, it sounds like it might be some, an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got, which is usually caused by a virus, but it can be from something you've eaten as well. Um, if the symptoms, they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts. Um, if the symptoms are continuing to get worse, the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough. Um, sometimes you do require certain medication to help this if it's, sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria. Okay. Um, what I would say, probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not starting to ease off, I think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment. Okay. Um, and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated, because if you're, if you're not keeping fluid down, then you can get dehydrated. Um, so- So how, how do I, how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even, like, drink water, I'm throwing up everything? Yeah. So you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago, so you're obviously still, um, hydrated enough to pass urine. But we, um, we should see you so that we can check your hydration and, um, get that sample sent off as soon as possible. Okay. 'Cause if, if, if you come into the clinic, you can send that sample off straight away. Otherwise, we would have to post it out to you, which would take time. Oh, okay. So when can I come to the clinic to have this done? Um, so we can, we can make you an urgent appointment, um, and then you can, you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration. Um, but if, in the meantime, obviously, you're feeling more unwell, then we would get you seen urgently in A&E. Okay. So you could call us back in the meantime. Okay. So what I'll do, yeah, if you could please book me the appointment, and then, yeah, I'll see how I feel, um, before the end of the day. Hopefully I don't need to go to A&E and, uh, and, uh ...
Yeah. ... (...). If you keep drinking, keep going with the rehydration salts with tiny sips constantly to tr- so, so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and, and you vomit. So just tiny, tiny sips, but just keep going with it. Um, and just have very simple food if you're gonna have anything, like toast or biscuit or something really light like that. Okay. Avoid, um, fruit, vegetables, um, milk, anything like that which might just make it worse. Okay. Okay? Okay. So you're happy to book an appointment through the support line? Yes, please. Right. Okay. We'll do that for you. Fine. Okay. Take care. Thank you. Thanks. Bye. Bye.
