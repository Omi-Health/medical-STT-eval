Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. Um, should we start? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Hello. How... um, good morning, sir. How can I help you this morning? Hi. Um, I've just had some, um, diarrhea for the last three days, um, and it's been affecting me. I need to stay close to the toilet and, um, yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Um, and, and when you say diarrhea, what do you mean by diarrhea? Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often or are your stools more loose? Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stool, going to the toilet quite often- Oh. ... um, and like, some pain in my, like, lower stomach. Okay. And how many times a day are you going, let's say, over the last couple of days? Um, probably like six, seven times a day. Six, seven times a day. Yeah. And you made mention it's mainly watery. Have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools? No, no blood. Yeah, just watery and loose stool. Okay. And you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well. Yep. Whereabouts is the pain exactly? So like in my lower abdomen, so, uh, like, um, yeah, just to one side. One side. And what side is that? Uh, on the left side. Left side, okay. And can you describe the pain to me? Yeah. It feels, um, like a cramp, uh, like a muscular cramp and, um, yeah, I feel a bit weak and shaky. Okay. And is the pain... is that... is it there all the time or does it come and go? Uh, it comes and goes. Comes and goes. Does the pain move anywhere else, for example, towards your back? Um, no, just mainly in my stomach. Okay. Fine. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well. What do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been having... uh, have you been feeling feverish, for example? Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like... uh, yeah, I just mainly feel weak. I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice, um, a temperature when the symptoms started, so- Okay. ... um, yeah, around about three or four days ago. Did you measure your temperature then? Yeah, I, I didn't measure my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Any other symptoms like sweating or, um, night- Uh, no. No. And, uh, any vomiting at all? Yeah. So, um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms, but now, um, I've stopped vomiting. You've stopped vomiting. Okay. And was your vomit... I know it's not nice thing to talk about, but was it just normal food color? Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit. Yeah. Yeah. And there was no blood in your vomit, is that right? No blood. No. No. Okay. Yeah. Um, and, um, any, any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhea, you mentioned your vomiting. Yeah. Um, anything else that comes to mind? Um, I had a loss of appetite. Okay. Um, so I haven't been eating as much. Okay. Um, but I've been able to hold down fluids. Okay, so you're drinking fluids. Yeah. Um, what kind of foods have you managed to eat, if anything? Um, just soups and, uh, yeah, light foods like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly. Okay. Fine. Um, and so, uh, you started three days ago with symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused your symptoms, uh, to kick on? So for example, things like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people who would similar symptoms. Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago. Um, uh, but other than that, I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Okay. Nothing unusual. Yeah. Do you remember what you ate? Um, yeah, I a- I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Okay. Anyone else unwell with similar symptoms? Um, so no one else in the family. So, uh, wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms. Okay. Okay. Fine. Um, right. And, uh, in terms of your, your overall health, are you normally fit and well or, uh- Um, yeah, I mean, other than, um, asthma, um, I use an inhaler. Everything, uh, else is fine. Okay. And is your asthma well-controlled? Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler and, uh, that's under control. Fine. And you don't have any other tummy problems, bowel problems I should be aware of? No. No. Okay. Um, and apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications? Uh, no, no other medications. Okay. Fine. And in terms of just your, your day-to-day life, you said it's been affecting your life, um- Yeah. ... in what way has it been affecting your life? Uh, so I need to stay close to the toilet because I go quite frequently during the- these past three days. Okay. Um, yeah, other than that, it's, uh- Yeah. ... yeah, the main concern. And have you... are you currently working at the moment? Uh- I, yes. Yeah, I, I work. Uh- What work? Um, I'm an accountant. Okay. Have you been going into work the last three days or have you been at home? Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Okay. Yeah. That must be difficult for you then. Yeah, it's been quite difficult. Right. And you say, you mentioned you live with a wife and two children, is that right? Yes. Yeah. All right. Um, just a couple of other questions we need to ask, sir. Um, do you smoke at all? Uh, no, I don't smoke. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Uh, no, I, I don't drink alcohol. No. Okay. Yeah. So, um, uh, normally at this stage I like to, um, examine you, if that's okay, but, um- Yeah. ... um, but, but having listened to your story, sir, I think, uh, um, just to recap, you, for the last three days, you've been having loose stool, diarrhea, bit of tummy pain, mainly on the left-hand side, um, and vomiting and feeling generally quite weak and lethargic. Yeah. Um, you mentioned you're having this Chinese takeaway as well three days ago, and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. Okay. Um, it seems like you may have something, uh, called gastroenteritis. Oh. Which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your, of your tummy. Yeah. Um, mainly caused by viruses, but they can be a possibility of bacteria, uh, causing your symptoms. Yeah. Um, at this stage, uh, what, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So- Okay. ... uh, I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just, um, making sure you're well-hydrated, so drinking fluids. Um, uh, there are things like Diaralyte you can get from the pharmacy, which, uh, it's, um, it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. Okay. Um, and if you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would say recommend that at first, you know, first couple of days. Yeah. Um, if you are feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol. Yeah. Uh, two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. I'll certainly advise you to take some time off work, actually. I know you're quite keen to work. Um, I would say next two, two to three days, um- Yeah. ... as the infection clears from your system, take some time off and rest. Um, you know, if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in, in three to four days, I'd like to come back and see you again. Okay. Sure. Um, because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether it's something else causing your symptoms. Yeah. Uh, and we may need to do further tests like, um, taking a sample of your stool so we can test that- Okay. ... um, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, sure. Yeah. How's that sound? That sounds great. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have any questions for me? Um, no, no further questions. No. Okay. Is, is the treatment plan clear? Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's, that's very clear. Thank you. Great. Well, I wish you all the best. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye-bye.
