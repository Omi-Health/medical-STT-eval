Hello? Hello. Can you hear me well? Uh, yes, I think. It's a bit better. It's a bit- it's a bit- it's not very clear, but let's- let's continue anyway. Okay. Okay. Let's start again. So how can I help you, sir? Yes. So it's been a few days now. I have, like, a sore and red skin. It's kind of- it's really itchy and it's, like, super annoying. Okay. So I'd like to find something quick to solve it. No, no problem. I'm happy to help. Um, whereabout on your skin is it affected? Um, mostly, like, my chest, my- my hands, my arms. Like- like really, it's- it's super annoying. Like, it's itching a lot, like, all the time, and I can't even sleep at night. Like, I really need something quickly to- to solve it, because even at work I- like, um, when I'm in a meeting and I have to, like, uh, think about my work and focus, like, actually focus on my work- Yeah. ... it's really annoying, because I can't actually think about, uh, what I have to say. I'm always, like, uh, disturbed by this disease. No, no. Okay. I understand. I'm sorry this is obviously affecting you, and, uh, we'll try our very best to get- get it sorted out for you. Um, have you had anything like this before in the past? Um, so yes. Uh, earlier, I was, like, prescribed for my eczema. Okay. And, uh, they gave me, like, some cream and something to, uh, when I, like, was shower- uh, when I was in the shower, I had to put something. Okay. But, um, yeah. Did it help? Um, I mean, at that time, yes. But the symptoms, like, these symptoms, like- when the symptoms appeared again, I tried those, and it didn't work. I've tried a few things. Like I bought, like, a steroid cream at the pharmacy last night, but it apparently didn't help because it's still itching a lot today. Okay. Uh, yeah. Do you remember the name of the cream you bought? A steroid cream. Okay, steroid. Okay. That's okay. Um, do- would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms, or different? Um, it's much more, like, itchy. And my eczema was more, like, only in the arms, and now it's al- also on the chest and in the- and the- on the hands as well. Okay. And actually, yeah, when- like I like, for instance, hiking- Right. ... during the weekends, and I- I can't really do it anymore because it's, like, very- like- like, I wanted to do that last weekend, and it was super painful. Right. And I have to take, like, showers every day to be able to kind of, uh, ease this itching parts, which is very, very annoying. No. Well- well, okay. That's okay. So you mentioned the itchiness. Yeah. Um, you also mentioned it's been quite sore. Um- Yeah, exactly. Have you noticed any, uh, bleeding or discharge from your skins? No. Um, so my skin is a bit cracked in some parts, like kind of cracked, if you see what I mean. Okay. But, uh, yeah. You haven't noticed any- any other, uh, pus or blood coming out of your skin? No. No. And you mentioned it all started three days ago. Are you- Four days ago. Four days ago. Are you aware of any triggers? Anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start? So for example, have you changed your, uh, shower gel, any clothing? Have you been around anyone �� No, uh, uh, it's actually, like- it's really annoying because I'm thinking about maybe I should change something, because I- I haven't, and I don't understand. And I'm kind of, um, afraid of asking people around me because it's kind of, you know, um, I don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions. It's kind of intimate and- Mm-hmm. So I need your help now. Hmm. No, no, no. Okay. That's okay. Um, fine. So just to re- summarize, for the last four days, you've had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, mainly your chest. Uh, did you also mention your arms and legs as well? Um, no. Just the chest- Maybe. ... hands and, like- like, inside the elbows. Okay. Yeah. Anything on your face at all? In my what? On your face? Oh, on my face? No. No. Okay. And apart from this, any other symptoms have you noticed? For example, have you noticed any temperature or fevers? No, no. Just the itching. Itching? Nothing else. Okay. So your- your bowels are working okay? Your chest is okay? No cough, no breathing difficulties? No. You're passing urine okay? Uh, I think so. Okay. All right. Um, it's always good to know, so I mean, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Any what? Any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Um, I- so I had eczema before, so maybe it's this, but it seems like more, uh, like, uh, my eczema was only on the arms, so I'm- I'm not sure. I- I really have no idea. Okay. No, that's okay. So, um, normally at this stage, I like to examine you, um, to see the rash itself and see exactly what type of rash it is. But from what you've told me, you mentioned it's- you've got some dry skin and some, uh, cracked skin as well. Yeah. Uh, and it's been very itchy. And so with your, um, uh, your- your background of eczema, um, so there's- there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you, which I completely forgot. My apologies. Um, apart from the eczema, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? Uh, no. I just had asthma in the past, but- Okay. ... not anymore. Not anymore. Okay. And do you take any regular medications at the moment? Uh, no. No. Okay. Do you have any allergies to anything? I, like- sorry, yeah. Just- Sorry. I said do you have any allergies to anything? Hello? Hello? Yes. Oh, can you hear me? Uh, sorry, I think it cracked. Um, do you have any allergies at all? Oh, allergies? Uh, no. No. Okay. Um, and tell me about your, um, uh, your situation at home. Who do you live with?Uh, so I live with a few flatmates. I'm, uh... So you know I'm 31? Uh, I, yeah, um, I have a full-time job and so I'm living with a few people to save money. Okay. And what do you do for work? Uh, I work, uh, at a pharmaceutical company. So it's been, uh, it's been a few years now. Uh, it's, uh, it's kind of interesting. We're working on, uh, like a, kind of project manager. Uh, and then... Do you want to, to know more about it? Okay. Uh, no, no, no, that's absolutely, that's absolutely fine. Um (smacks lips) just a couple of questions I want to ask you which can sometimes affect your symptoms is, do you smoke at all? No. No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Uh, you know wha- once in a while I like, and I like hanging out with people once in a while. So yeah, I'd say a few, a few beers per week, something like this. Nothing, nothing crazy. I used to drink a lot more when I was younger but it's been- Hmm. ... it's been a while. Okay. So... Okay. I've got to say at this stage, I've got to say the, the, the sound quality is not, uh, great but I, I will continue because we've come this far. Um, so- Sure. ... um, based on everything you mentioned, sir, I, I, I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema. Um, the reason being that you said it's quite itchy. Um, it's mainly affecting your chest and your back. Um, and, uh, the... Having looked at your skin, uh, the, the, the rash does appear quite familiar. Um, you mentioned u- using steroid creams yesterday, um, from the pharmacy. I wonder whether giving you stronger prescription of a s- uh, of a steroid may be beneficial- Okay. ... uh, which I'm happy to prescribe to you today. As well as that- Okay. ... I'm gonna give you something, some emollients which helps to moisturize the skin, um- Okay. ... which we'll use in the bath and shower. And it's definitely worth, uh, using that for the first seven to ten days, uh- Okay. ... before we make a decision on whether it's working or not. Um, it's also worth, um, using antihistamines which you can sometimes buy over counter, things like loratadine or Piriton which can help the itchiness of your- Okay. ... skin. And, uh, um, it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap, because if that's causing your symptoms then we need to have a discussion about it next time I see you. Okay. Just, I, I have tried antihistamines, uh, lately but it didn't really help. Oh, could you say that again? Sorry. I have tried the antihistamines- Okay. ... uh, but it didn't really help. It didn't, okay. So something for you to think about, y- you can get different type of antihistamines. I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well, um- Okay. ... something like fexofenadine which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying it, it's not going to do you any harm. Um, but I'm saying thing using the steroids and the emollients, uh, on a regular basis, um, over the next week to 10 days should hopefully cure, control your symptoms. But do come back and see me next week if things don't get better. That sounds good. Okay. Um, do you have any questions for me? Uh, no, that's it. Okay. Well, I wish you all the best. Thank you very much. Okay. Have a good day. Right. Thank you, doctor. Bye.
