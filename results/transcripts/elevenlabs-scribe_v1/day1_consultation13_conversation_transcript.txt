... there's no delays. Hi. Hello? Hi, there. Hello, there. Um, thanks for, thanks for being here. Um, before I go any further, can I, uh, confirm your name and your age, please? Yes. It's, um, Adriana Katranjieva, and I'm 26 years old. Okay, Adriana, and how can I help you this afternoon? Well, I have this, like, really crazy headache that's been going on for a few days, and it really annoys me. Oh, dear. Okay. Wh- when, when did it exactly start, this headache? Uh, around three days ago, maybe. Three days ago? Okay. And whereabouts in your head is this pain? Um, it's basically, like... It kinda feels all over my head, but like mainly a- um, around my right eye. Oh- Um... ... right eye. Okay. Um, and is the headache there all the time, or does it come and go? Um, it's, it kinda comes and goes. Um, but... I mean, it is there all the time, but, like, sometimes it's stronger. Okay. So it comes and... right, okay. And if I was to ask you, on a scale of one to ten, um, ten being the worst type of pain you've ever had, how would you rate this headache? Uh, it's probably a eight. Eight. And if I were to ask you to describe the headache to me, um, in terms of the nature of the pain. Is it sharp? Is it dull? Is it crampy? Is it throbbing? Um, it's kinda... It's dull, but sometimes it gets a bit sharper. So basically, it like... it develops gradually, I guess. It's like, uh, the first day, it just started when I was at work. Mm-hmm. And by the end of the day, it was like, pretty, pretty... like, it was a lot basically. And then I was thinking, "Okay, maybe I'll just go to sleep." Mm-hmm. And then I woke up the next morning, like, it was even, even worse basically. So- So, you're saying the headache was getting worse over the last three days? Yeah. Okay. Have you tried anything which has made the headache better? Um, so I tried, uh, ibuprofen. Um, so I took, like, a few, um, for the last two days, basically. Did that help? But it doesn't really help. No. In the, in the past it did help me, which is why I decided to try it, but... Okay. All right. And except the headaches, any other symptoms at all? So- Um- ... for example, any problems with your eyesight or your vision? Not really, but just when it started I, I got this, like, weird shooting lights. And like, now, like, light is quite annoying my eyes. So when you say annoying, does it hurt to look, uh, look at bright lights? Yeah. Yeah. It hurts, so... Okay. And, um, have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision? Not loss of vision, I wouldn't say. It's just like some lights from- Hmm. ... shooting lights............................. Okay. Any nausea or any vomiting? Um, well, I'm... Like, basically I'm, I'm sick with the headache, but I... no vomiting. When you say sick, you mean you feel sick? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. No vomiting. Okay. Any neck pain or neck stiffness? No. Okay. And any difficulty with speaking or, um, speech? No. Any difficulty with, with weakness in your arms and legs? No. It's hard to focus, though, so I, I had to take a couple of days off work, actually. Oh, really? Okay. Okay. No problem. Well, I'll, I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on. Um, any recent head injuries at all? Uh, no. Okay. And have you had anything like this before in the past? Yeah. I mean... Headaches, you mean? Or, or s- similar to, similar to this kind of headache............................. Yeah. I mean, I had. But usually after I, I take, uh, ibuprofen it kinda goes away, so... But this time it's just not. It's just not. Oh, okay. Don't worry. Right. Um, any temperatures or fevers? No. Any rashes at all on your skin? Hmm, no. Not that I've noticed. Okay. And just moving forwards, are you otherwise fit and well, Adriana? Am I what, sorry? Are you fit and well? Do you have any other medical histories? Yeah, I think so. It's just the headache. Any history of migraines at all? Not myself. I've never had a migraine. But my sister and my mom have them, uh, quite frequently. Okay. Um, fine. I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask, do you take any regular medication? Uh, no. Are you on the pill? No. Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medications? Not that I know of. Okay. So you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines? Yeah. Are they... Is that normally well-controlled, or are they, um, having difficulty controlling the symptoms? Um, so my sister's, like, better. Like, it kinda is very rare. But my mom's is, like, quite bad. Um, usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that it's... Yeah. Mm-hmm. Takes her out for a few days, basically. All right. Okay. Fine. Um, socially, tell me a bit more about your life outside of, um, outside of work. So, who lives at home with you? Uh, I live with housemates, so three of them. Okay. So we're............................. It's... Excellent. And are you working at the moment? You mentioned this is impacting on your work. Yeah. So I work... Well, I work in IT, so I work with computers a lot. So I kinda is difficult to focus. Um, I had to, like, reduce the, uh, brightness of my screen. Hmm. Okay. Do you wear glasses? Yes, I do. Have you had any, have you had any recent eye check done, eye test?No, uh, I've been wearing them since I was fives y- five year old, so. Okay. It's fine. All right. Something for you to bear in mind, if you feel like your eyes are straining, um, I would always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Um- Mm-hmm. ... have you been more stressed or anxious at work recently? Well, it's been a bit stressful, kicking off a new project. But, um, yeah, nothing out of the ordinary, really. Okay. All right. Great. Um, regarding smoking or alcohol, do you drink or smoke at all? I socially smoke, and I drink, not only socially. So, only socially? Okay. Right. Now, um, Adriana, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Have you, have you read anything online or spoken to people? Um, not really. Um, I, for at first I thought it's stress, or maybe I didn't drink enough water, because sometimes when I don't drink enough water, I, I, I get headaches. Mm-hmm. Um, but I don't think that's it. And I'm, like, worried it's... I don't want it to be a migraine, because I know what it's like from my mom and my sister. Hmm. And it's really annoying, so I, I really don't wanna have that. And I know it's genetic, so I've researched that. Uh, but I don't know if that is the case, so yeah. Okay. Is there anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today? Yeah, maybe just kinda, if you have any recommendations of something I can take, something stronger, because apparently ibuprofen doesn't help me. Okay. Um, usually it gets resolved, if I have headache, in like, after like one or two days. But currently, it, it didn't help me. How many tablets did you take of ibuprofen? Uh, three a day. Three a day. Okay. All right. Um, so Adriana, so, um, really what I think is going on here, un- unfortunately, I do think this could be a headache very similar to a migraine. Um, the reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it, given your mom and your sister also have migraines. I think it's something for us to think about. Um, now, I'm not saying it's gonna keep happening, that it may just be a one-off, but it's certainly worth treating it today with some stronger analgesia or painkillers. Um, now moving forward, we have some options which we can discuss. Uh, you tried the ibuprofen. Now, my only worry is I'm not sure whether you're taking the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets three times a day. Oh, right. Okay. So, there's definitely room for improvement there. Or I can prescribe you something stronger, like Naproxen, which is another anti-inflammatory which can be helpful. Okay. Um, we can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or codeine, which might be helpful as well. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think codeine is what my mom takes for when she has, um, um, migraines. Okay. I think it's, it's certainly worth looking into those. I can give you a prescription for that today. Um, with regards to, um, the next few days, it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's... You know, if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse. Mm-hmm. And, and, you know, I'd like you to come back and see me in about, uh, a week's time, a week to two weeks' time. If you are having f- more frequent episodes of these type of headaches, we can think about giving you medications as prophylactic, which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis. But we can have that discussion next time. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay? In the meantime, if your headaches aren't getting any better or they're getting worse, um, you know, why don't you give me a call or come back and see me sooner? Okay? Okay. Yeah. So, if you have any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs, or you're just not feeling very well, just gimme a call and come back and see me. Okay. All right? Great. Great. Well, have a good day. Thank you. You too. Bye. All right.
