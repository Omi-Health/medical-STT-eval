Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes. Great. Excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your, um, age, please? Uh, yes. I'm Laura Parkinson, and, uh, I'm 45. Forty-five. All right, Laura. Well, how can I help you this afternoon? Uh, yeah. So, I have, uh, soreness in my fingers, and my finger, like, the skin on my hands is kind of cracked. Oh, okay. When, when did this all start? Um, a couple of months ago, like three, four months ago. Three, four... Oh, okay. So it's been that long, has it? Yeah. Okay. And so you mentioned your... The h- is it the skin on your hands mainly that's dry? Yeah. I haven't noticed... I mean, I have dryness, like, you know, in other parts, like my legs, but it's not, it's not very... It's not severe. It's just, you know, I've always... You know. I don't hydrate very much, so. Right. Okay. Yeah. Like it's very, it's very bad on my hands. Okay. Can I ask why have you come to see me today? Uh, is it because it's got worse recently, your symptoms? Yeah. I mean, uh, it's gotten to the point where, where it hurts a lot and I can't really do my job, so I thought I should probably get it checked out. Yeah. That sounds like a very sensible plan. Um, which part of your hands are affected mainly? Uh, the palm. Palm. And the fingers. Yeah. Okay. All right. Um, have you noticed any itchiness on your palms? Yeah. It's itchy. Not all the time, but yeah, it does get itchy. Okay. Any bleeding at all? Uh, hmm, I don't... I mean, no, I don't think so. Are you scratching yourself, are you scratching yourself often and bleeding? Um, yeah. I guess when I've scratched it, yes, it has bled sometimes. But yeah, otherwise it, it hasn't bled on its own. Okay. Um, right. Uh, okay. Sorry. I'm still writing notes as we go along. Um, and you mentioned the skin is quite cracked as well. Is that right? Yes. That's right. Okay. All right. Um, wh- I know this is a long time ago, but do you remember how it all started? What were you doing at the time when it all started? Is there anything you may have done to bring your symptoms on? Uh, I mean, I am a... I do work as a housekeeper. Mm-hmm. Um, and to be honest, I'm not always very good about wearing gloves. Mm-hmm. So that- Okay. ... could be related. Um, I switched jobs, uh, four months ago. Okay. So. I've been working for, as a housekeeper for, for a while, though, but, um, that's the only thing I can think of. Yeah. I think that might be quite important, actually. I think there's definitely maybe a correlation between the two. Um, fine. And so you mentioned something about having general dryness. Is that, you mentioned your legs as well? Yeah. Is that- Yeah, but it's... Sorry. Is that something you've, you've had for a while now? Yeah. It's not really, it's not really major. Uh- Okay. Yeah. It's just, like, a little bit of dryness on my legs. Right. Okay. But I've never had trouble. Okay. Well, I'm just gonna ask you some very brief yes or no questions. That's okay? With your symptoms, have you, have you had any other symptoms such as fever or temperatures? Uh, no. Any nausea or any vomiting? No. Any problems with your bowels? No. And any problems with your urine or water works? No. Otherwise, you feel well, do you, in yourself? You're eating and drinking, your appetite is well maintained? Yeah. I feel, I feel good. Okay. All right. Fine. Um, in terms of your past medical history, do you have any other conditions at all? I have diabetes. Do you know if that's type one or type two? Type two. Diabetes. Okay. Anything else? Um, no. Any skin problems? No. Eczema, dermatitis, for example? Not that I know of, no. I haven't been diagnosed yet. No. Okay. Which medications do you take? Metformin. Metformin. Okay. Do you have any allergies, either to any medications or in general? No. Okay. Family history-wise, is there anything I should be aware of? Diabetes as well. Diabetes as well? Yeah. Okay. Again, any skin problems? Uh, no. Not that I know of. Any history of asthma or bowel problems? Uh, no. No. Okay. All right. Um, fine. In terms of social history, you mentioned that you work as a housekeeper. Yeah. Um, and you're not always very good at wearing gloves. Yeah. Um, and you've recently changed jobs. Which, what, where, which kind of place did you work in? Is it mainly residential or is it commercial? Uh, it's a hotel. Hotel, okay. Like, I do the whole thing, like the bedrooms, bathrooms, corridors. Okay. Do you think there might be a relationship between the two, between the, kind of the products you're using and your symptoms? Yeah. I, I usually use gloves for bathrooms, but yeah, bedrooms and corridors, not always. Okay. Have your symptoms stopped you from doing any work? Have you had to take time off work recently? Uh, yeah. Like, the past three days, I haven't been able to go to work. Okay. All right. Can I ask a couple of questions? Do you smoke at all? No. Do you drink much in the way of alcohol? A pint a week. Once a week? Uh, a couple of pints a week. A couple of pints a week. Okay. So very minimal alcohol there. Um-... right. Have you tried anything for your symptoms? Have you tried, b- anything over the counter, any creams? Yeah, I've tried, uh, E45. Any luck with that? Yeah, no, it didn't really do anything. No? Okay. All right. Um, I need to- I have tried an- anti-histamines. Anti-histamines. Okay. Uh, but it didn't help. Okay, all right. Um, Mrs. Parkinson, so I think, um, based on your story, I thi- I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis, which is very common in particularly people in your, in your, in your field who are using cleaning products, not using gloves. You can sometimes get a bit of a reaction between the chemicals and your skin. Yep. Um, so moving forward, there's a couple of options. So firstly, what we try and do is, you know, avoid the triggers. In your case, I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times. Okay. In terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin, um, we can try some steroid creams to help with the inflammation. Okay. As well as some stronger emollients, um, which you really need to kind of coat on throughout the day, three, four times a day for the next couple of weeks, just to help with the moisturizing of your skin. Okay. Um, if it still hasn't got better in about a week to two weeks time, I really want you to come back and see me again, and we can maybe think about other things we can give to you. Okay. Is that all clear? Uh, yeah, that sounds good. Great. Do you have any questions for me? Um, where do I get the medicines from? Oh, so I'll, I'll, I'll do a s- prescription for you now and, uh, send it over to your pharmacy. Okay, great. Mm-hmm. Yeah, uh, so you said a couple of weeks it should get better, right? I think, uh, yeah, I think a minimum couple of weeks, uh, 10 days to 14 days. Um, and if it still hasn't got better or indeed if it's getting worse, so if it's spreading or your dryness is getting worse, come back and see me sooner. Okay? Great. Thank you, Laura. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Bye-bye now. Bye.
