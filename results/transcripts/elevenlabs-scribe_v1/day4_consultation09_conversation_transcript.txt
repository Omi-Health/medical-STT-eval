Hello? Oh, hello. Hi. Hi. How you doing? Uh, my name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I have your name, please? Yeah, sure. Um, Daniel. Hi, Daniel. And your date of birth? Uh, May of 1992. '92. Okay, Daniel. And, uh, are you in a, a comfortable and confidential place to talk? Yeah, totally. H- happy to go ahead. Great. How can I help? Um, yeah, I just... My chest has been feeling really tight. Okay. And how long has this been going on for, Daniel? Uh, for about three hours now. Okay. And so tight chest for three hours. Um, and so you were born in '92, so that makes you 26. Um- 26, yeah. And you are, uh... Any shortness of breath at all with that? Yeah, like a little bit. Um, yeah, a little bit short of breath. Not too bad. Uh, any cough, wheeze? Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well and there's coughy, coughing, yeah. Slight cough. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Sore throat, runny nose, sore ears? You know, I had a cold last week and it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose. I was just feeling under the weather. Mm-hmm. Are you feeling better now, other than the tight chest? I mean, I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore. Right. Okay, okay. But you now, now you've got this, this... Uh, so you've still got, still got, uh, symptoms of a cold essentially? Yeah, the cough's kinda stuck around. Ah. Oh, yeah. Okay. Are you coughing up anything? Uh, no. And, um, do you have any other medical problems like asthma? Yeah. Yeah, I have asthma. I've had it for a while now. Um, and then I have like a hay fever. You know, some allergies to dust and stuff like that. Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any, any medications? Um, yeah. So, uh, you know the, um, uh, Ventolin? It's called, uh, salbutamol. Yeah. I got that one and then I have a steroid. Uh, Clenel, Clenel inhaler. Oh, yeah. Clenil Modulate. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. And, um, uh, have you been using Clenel and the Ventolin? And how often have you been using them? Um, well, to be honest, I was away at uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me, so I haven't really in the past week. Both of them? Because, because, um, sorry, they ran out and I, I forgot to go and grab the next one- Yeah, sure. ... about a week ago. Yeah. Okay. All right. All right. So, so, so you've, you haven't got any Clenel or any Ventolin at the moment? Not with me right now. No, I ran it out. Okay. All right. Um, and e- any drug allergies that you know of? No. No. Not allergic to anything. Just like, just the dust and stuff, but nothing... no drugs. Okay, great. Now, uh, do anyone in your family have any medical problems that you know of? Um, yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Oh, oh, when I was young I also had eczema and I had a milk protein allergy when I was young too. Hmm. Okay. Um, right. So just, uh, do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or, um, hopes for this consultation? Um, not really. Like I feel like asthma's probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers would be helpful. Um, it's just kinda scary 'cause I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight, uh, in a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I can, I can imagine. Um, well, it certainly sounds like, uh, you've, you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough. Um, and it's non-productive cough and you're short of breath. Uh, is the cough worse at nighttime? I mean, it gets a little bit worse at night, but basically just pretty consistent. Yeah. It hasn't gone away. Okay. And you've got this tight, tight chest, but you wouldn't say you've got chest pain. Just more a tight chest, is it? No, not really pain. It's more like tight. It just feels like sometimes I can't get a full breath in, you know? Yeah, sure. Um, okay. Well, I, I would quite like to, uh, certainly get you some, uh, Ventolin, Clenol Modulate. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit more like back in high school. Yeah. Um, but I've been pretty good at taking my med- my inhalers, so not, not so much anymore. Have you ever been to hospital, uh, as an inpatient, as in, you know, stayed in there overnight for asthma? Yeah, when I was in high school I had to have a tube put down my throat. Oh, okay. So you, so you, so you, uh, you ha- you went to hospital and had a... Uh, y- you... So you stayed in hospital for a few days, did you, with an asthma exacerbation? Yeah, I did. Yeah. Okay. But currently you're just on Ventolin and Clenol and you haven't got any of those ster- uh, those inhalers at the moment? Yeah, I've been pretty good. I've been pretty good just on the Clenol and the salbutamol. Okay. And when... Sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation? Uh, I think I was like 17. 16 maybe. Sure. Okay. Um-Just to quantify how short of breath you are, um, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you? No, you won't have, will you? No. Um, are you able to, like, walk up a flight of stairs okay, walk in a flat okay without getting too short of breath, or, um, are you short of breath at rest? Uh, I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like except for that feeling I was describing. It does, when I'm walking up stairs, I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be. Sure. Yeah. Okay. But you're not short of breath at rest at the moment? No. No, no, I'm not. Okay, fine. So, what, what I think, and, and just, just to go over, is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the, uh, a prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting from this? Well, I just want to know that I'm okay so I just, like, keep... I just don't wanna have to get, um, that, that intubation again. Sure. Yeah. No, absolutely. As long as I'm okay. Well, I'm really glad that you've sp- talked to me today. I think what we can do is, is give you a prescription for, uh, some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within the hour, I would hope. Um, and, uh, I think what... The other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So this is, these are tablets which, um, you can take for five days, uh, two tablets in the morning, and, uh, that should just dampen down your asthmatic response, okay? Okay. Um, now there are some side effects to the steroids, which I should really tell you about, but please read the label that's associated with it. Don't be too worried about the side effects. They're unco- Most, you know, mo- most of the time, the steroids are very well tolerated. And, uh, you prob- Do you... Have you had them in the past do you know of? Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Have you had steroids in the past? Um, I can't remember. Probably. Probably. Yeah, I would think probably too. Yeah. (laughs) Um. So, um, they, they can come, they can make you, your mood change. It can be slightly low or s- too slightly high. It can give you a high blood sugar, um, and, uh, they're, uh, o- oc- they can also cause rash and nausea, um, headaches. But mostly, it's well tolerated and it should help your asthma an awful lot. Okay. Um, uh, what I'd like to do is, is send you these, the, some prescriptions for your, uh, inhalers are ongoing so, um, you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can, you can use the Clinimodulate in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN by... So, uh, Ventolin when you need to, um, when you're getting Okay. ... wheezy. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than, uh, every three hours, uh, at, at any time, it's a good idea to seek medical attention, so, um, see a doctor, um- Okay. ... in some capacity. Uh, (clears throat) and the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which will allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Have you... Do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before? Yeah, yeah. I, somebody taught me how to use one a while ago. I don't, I don't really use it, to be honest, but... Have you got one? I think I do. I have one somewhere. Okay. All right. Well, um, I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially, uh, a couple of puffs to prime it inside, breathing in and out, um, uh, for five, five or ten breaths. Okay. Uh, yeah. So, uh, was there anything else that was on your mind or you were concerned about at this stage? I think you've got me covered. Okay. Um, and, uh, I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but, uh, I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're okay with that. Okay. Thanks. All right? Yeah. All righty. Okay. Well, thank you very much. No worries. Any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath, um, or just generally concerning symptoms, uh, pain in your chest, tightness, uh, feeling light-headed, uh, then seek further medical attention any time please. Okay? All right. Sounds good. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
