Hello. Hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hi. I'm Ben. You all right? Uh, not really. So ju- so jus- just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please? Uh, m- my name is, uh, Jonathan Irving. And your date of birth? Uh, 6/12/80. And your address for me, please? Uh, 62 Lewin Road, Streatham, SW16 6JT. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation? Yes. Yeah. You've mentioned you had some breathing difficulties in the- in the notes. So how can I help you? Yeah, so about 15 minutes ago, I was gardening and, um, I was stung by a wasp, uh, ran inside- Mm-hmm. ... and now I'm, um, just starting to notice a few things. Yeah, I'm having quite shallow breaths. You're having difficulties breathing since then? Yeah? Yes. Yeah. Okay. So is there any swelling of your lips, you feel like your throat is closing up? Not throat, but I can... I... yeah, I can s- I can definitely feel something in the lips. Yeah. Like, like a tingling kind of feeling? Yes. Yeah. Okay. But no swelling. Yeah? No. I mean, I... you know, to be honest, I'm just doing this to establish whether I should go to hospital. Okay. Right. Okay. Have you had anything like this before? Uh, no. No. Okay. So, um, do you feel wheezy in your chest or just tightness? Uh, yeah. Um, a bit of tightness. Yeah, a bit of tightness. Yeah. Bit of tightness. Okay. Okay. So I... unfortunately, I don't have much of your past medical history. Do you have any significant past medical or surgical history you'd like to share? Uh, no, not really. Uh, a bit of eczema and I'm allergic to penicillin. Okay. Are you on any regular medication at all? Not at the moment, no. Okay. Right. Yeah. Fine. Are you having any rash in your body at the moment? Yes, there's a bit of blotching down here. Blotching. But- Okay. Well, have you taken anything at all for the blotching? I wouldn't even know what to take now. Okay, so you've... o- okay. That's fine. So from what you are saying, you do need to ha- ha- have medical attention straight away. Okay. Um, i- do you have any antihistamines in your house at all? Um, yes, I've used them for flying. I have sinusitis, so yes, I do somewhere. So why, why... and I... because your, the, your breathing problem can get worse very quickly, I'd like you to call... Is there someone else at home with you? Yes, my wife can take me to the emergency room. Yeah. Uh, no, I wouldn't want your wife to take you. I would li- I'd like her to gi- call the ambulance because that might take a bit longer and, you know, we need to deal with it quickly. So what we are worried about is, you know, in case you develop an anaphylactic reaction. Okay, she's listening. I'll get her to call now. Yeah. Yeah. So I'll ask her to give you the, um, antihistamine in the meantime while the ambulance is coming and take yourself to hospital. Um, it might just be an urticaria reac- reaction, but because you're complaining of breathing difficulties, it is quite important that you go to hospital straight away. But I'd like you to call the ambulance because, you know, so that you'll be sorted out quickly. Okay? Yeah. All right. Thank you. She's on it now. Yeah, she's on the phone. Okay. All right then. You take care. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Bye-bye.
