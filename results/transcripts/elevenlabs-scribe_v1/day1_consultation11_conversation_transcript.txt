Hello? Hello? Hello. Hello. Can you hear me okay? I, I can hear you but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Um... Is, is that okay? Am I meant to... No, that's completely- Just a connection on the screen? It's audio. No, no, it's absolutely fine. Okay. Um, now before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? Um, so, um, so my name is, uh, Dan Chowdhury. I am seven- 27. 27? Okay. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan? Um, so I've just, um, been having some troubles. Basically in a, it's, uh, I guess it's been a little while now and, uh, just been feeling not so great and it's all come from, like... uh, it's like basically I think it's diarrhea and it's, like, just coming out, like, loads of it. Like, uh, I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it... Yeah, it doesn't feel very solid. It's, uh, just, it's just pouring straight from my bum, and like, just coming out and it's, uh... Yeah, it's just, uh, not, not being very pleasant and like, I just, it just kind of hasn't... Doesn't feel like it's getting better, so. Well, no, sorry to hear. Sounds like there's a lot going on there. Well, when did it all start, your symptoms? Um, so I think it was a few... When I think about it, so Monday, Tuesday... I, I thought, I think it was about three... It's been about three days now. Okay. And is it mainly diarrhea? You mentioned watery stools. Um, how many times are you going a day would you say? Um, so I f- I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake, um... Right, right. So... (laughs) Okay, so you're losing Hello. You're losing a lot of fluid, then? Yeah, so I mean, I'm dr- I'm trying to drink a lot of water but, um, yeah, it's just quite a lot and, uh, it's... Yeah, I- I think I, I feel like it's just, just fluids coming out. Okay. Have you had any blood in your stools? Um, so I... No, I don't, I don't remember anything, like, no, I d- I think it's just... Uh, nothing like that. There's nothing like that. Okay. And any, any tummy pain? Any, any, any pain in your tummy with, with- Yeah, I mean, I, it, I feel, I feel a cramp and then, and then I know it's time to go. Right? So, uh, uh, around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go, so, yeah, I mean, that's, that's the f- kind of the first sign. And where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? It's kind of, uh, I just don't wanna... If I think about it, it's like, it's like at the bottom. Uh, I don't know if that makes sense. Um- Yeah. Well, why don't we start with, is it, is it in the middle or is it to one particular side? Um, I, I think it f- it feels pretty s- like in the middle to me, not on any side, left or right. Okay. And does this pain come and go or is it there constantly? Um, it, it comes and goes. It comes and goes. Right, okay. And if I was to ask you on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you've ever had, how bad is this pain? Okay, so like... Um... Uh... So what do you mean by, uh, pain? So I, I think it's maybe that- Is this pain that's making you double over, is ten, is it ten out of ten the worst pain you've ever had? Or is it more of a kind of a mild pain, like a three out of ten? I, I guess so I'm... When I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it, so I can still sit down and, uh, I can still, like, cover it up and people don't really notice. Uh, I, I don't know what that means, but maybe it's that like a six or a seven. That's probably a six, I think. Okay. Okay. All right, good. Um, apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Um, yeah, I definitely, I definitely feel kind of nauseous. Um, like, I, and like I've, have vomited and when I, uh, like I think it's maybe something to do with, like, whenever I have like milk or something like that, I just feel like I wanna vomit and actually, like, yeah, one time I just like had some milk and I just completely vomited it. Oh, for he-... Okay. All right. I've been trying to avoid it, but, um, yeah. But the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea? Is that right? Um, sorry, could you repeat that? W- the, the vomiting is not as, uh, prominent as the diarrhea. Is that right? Uh, no, no, it's not. Okay, okay. All right. Um, any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? Um, so I... Yeah, I think I am pre-... I feel kind of really hot all the time and, um, I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that, but it's... I, yeah, I've, I've- Okay. ... sure I'm, I'm not, uh, like not a normal temperature. Okay, so you're feeling hot. Okay. And in terms of your water works, are you passing urine okay? Um, yeah, but I guess less frequently maybe. Um, but yeah, it seems to be okay. Okay. All right. Um, fine. And, and you said, you mentioned three days ago is when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you, for example, gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else and with diarrhea, for example? Um, so I know... So my, um, my brother has had, actually had something like this for, um, fi-... He has it as well for five days as well. Um, and I've, I've, I'm not... Yeah, I d- I can't think of what, what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally can deal, deals with this stuff a lot better than me. But yeah, I, that's why... Is your, is your brother now better? Um, he... So he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not, I'm not really sure. He said, he said he had, he's had something for a little while as well.Okay. All right. Are you having anything to eat or drink? Have you... I can see you're drinking your coffee. But are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? Um, so it just feels like, um, the, the fluids do go down but it just feels like it's going straight through. Just feels like it's going straight through. Okay. All right. Fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat? Which ke- which, uh, which you kept in? Um, so I had some... I mean, I had some lunch today. Um, but again, it just, it did, it just came, come out pretty loose. Okay. All right. Um, and, and Dan, moving forwards, are you otherwise fit and well or do you have any other medical history? Um, so I, um, yeah, I think, I think otherwise I'm fit and well. I, um, yeah, I mean, I, I'm an okay weight and, um, I, I can't think of any related medical history. Um- Mm-hmm. ... I mean, like my... Yeah. I, no, I d- I don't think so. I'll take it you don't take any regular medications then? So I, um... No, I mean, I, I've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately. But, uh, I haven't been... I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications? Um, so I don't have any allergies that I know of. Okay. And what about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? Um, bow- so would, would bowel, like does... Is the colon, like, something that- Yeah. Yeah. So what I mean by bowel is the whole gut, really. Oh. Anything from the mouth down to ...
Okay. So my, yeah, my, my dad actually has, um, colon cancer at the moment. Oh, dear. I'm really sorry to hear that. How is he? So, um, from what I heard, he's kind of... So I don't, I don't speak to him that often, so I don't, I don't know the exact details. And I, I don't exactly know the full things of like, the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing. Mm-hmm. Okay. But, um, he's sort of in his third stage. Uh, I'm not sure what that means exactly. Um... Yeah. Okay. But yeah. So yeah, it's, it's... Um, he's... Yeah. You can, I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting him a lot and, um- Mm-hmm. That's something because he's quite... I, I guess he's, um, had it for a little while now. Well, sounds really sad. Yeah. I'll make a note of that because, uh, it's sort of important to know these kind of details. Um, and socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan? Um, so, uh, not my brother. He doesn't live with me. I'm, I live with my, um, sister and my mum. Okay. And, uh, how are things at home? Um... Do you think they're ...
I think... In what sense do you mean that? In general, day-to-day life. Are you managing okay? Any particular challenges? I mean, uh, I think, uh, yeah, it's been, it's been tricky, um, going to work with all of this. Um, I dislike, um, taking time off work. I feel like I, I just wanna go, um, when I can, so I j- I try and go. Um, I think at, at home, uh, yeah, I just haven't really, um... I, I don't normally actually, um, eat with my family. I normally... I'm buying stuff and that kind of thing. So I don't think it's affected them and I haven't really been... I haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mum about it. Um, yeah. I'd, I'd just rather deal with these things. Cool. Um, so... Well, what... Are you mentioned... You mentioned work. What is it you do for work? Um, so I work at a, I, I work at, um, an office, um, in Central London. Um, it's, uh, so I work in government. Government. Okay. So you have an office. Okay. Right. Just a couple of last final c- uh, couple of que- questions. Uh, smoking and alcohol. Do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Um, so I, I smoke, um, I smoke, uh, uh, for like, socially. But not like, regularly. Um, so normally, if, if it's a Friday or something like that, I might, I might have a cigarette or something like that. But, um, no- And alcohol? Sorry? And alcohol? So alcohol, um, n- uh, you know, I might have a, a beer during the weekdays, may- uh, not that many. Maybe, um- But not too- ... on, on Fridays I have more, um, alcohol. Um, but yeah. I, a lot more units. Um, on a, uh, I suppose, um, not every week but maybe, uh, once or twice a month. But yeah, I'll- Cool. ... go out with my friends and we'll drink a lot, so that, that's, um, yeah. Um- Well, thank you for sharing with me. That's very helpful to know. So, um, Dan, just as a, uh, conclusion. Uh, um, just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis. Okay. A bit of a basically an infection of your tummy, of your gut. Okay. There's nothing to worry about. I, um, uh, I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days. Just like it did for your brother. Uh-huh. Drink, make sure you drink plenty of fluids. Okay? And you can- Should I just drink like normal water? I just feel like every time I drink- Well- ... it's just coming out. Um ... Clear fluid is probably best. I'm just ... But I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. Um, so you can get things like Diurilite, which is, um, a fluid replacement which you can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth re- uh, recommending that. Do I need like, a prescription for that? Uh, no, you can just get that over the counter. Okay. Um, you can try just, you know, regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so 48 hours, I want you to give me a call back because, um, you know, if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations. Okay? But I think let's, let's see how you are over the next one to two days. Okay. And, uh, we'll catch up soon. Okay? Okay. So you're saying that I should, I, I could... Uh, I'll try and buy this Diurilite. What, what should I do in terms of, um, food and that kind of thing? Should I just have fluids? Just clear fluids. Food is all... Yeah, absolutely. So clear fluids. You can use soft diet, things like soup, mash, and then gradually build up, um, as much as your body can tolerate. Um, but really, let's try and, uh, keep yourself well-hydrated first. Okay? Okay. Is it okay for me to carry on having like, um, paracetamol and things like that? Absolutely. If you are having, if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think paracetamol is very sensible. Okay. Okay. Try and s- avoid alcohol if you can. Uh, okay. I'll try. Yeah. Okay. All right, Dan. Okay. Thank you for your help. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks. No worries. Thanks for helping me out. Thank you. Bye-bye now. Okay. Bye.
