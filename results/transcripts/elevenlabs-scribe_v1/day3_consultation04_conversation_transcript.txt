Hi. Hi, hello, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Hi there. Hi. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please? Yeah, so my name is ...
And your date of birth. The 14th of July, 1996. And your address for me please? 28 Cricks Road, SW19 1EZ. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation? Thank you. Okay. So you mentioned in, in our notes that you've got some chest tightness. If you could like to tell me a bit more about it please. Yeah, so about two to three days ago I was running with a friend and usually I can talk to her whilst I ran, but I found myself actually short of breath. Um, I'm not really short of breath when I'm walking, um, but definitely, um, if I'm walking briskly now. Um, and I've used my blue inhaler, but to no avail. It hasn't really helped me. Mm-hmm. Um, yeah. So I'm having, I'm just wheezing a bit and coughing and just generally a bit short of breath. Wheezing and coughing, okay. And you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler. So how often are you using the blue inhaler? Um, I think I'm just using that as in when I have symptoms. Yeah. So, um, at the moment you are having shortness of breath. So are you using it every day at the moment? Um, yeah, and morning and evening to kind of prevent it as well. Okay. And, um, what, which color? What's the name of your preventer? Um, it's blue. Um, I think in totality, um, my history of salbutamol, Clenil, Cetraben, and hydrocortisone that I'm taking as well. Okay, so could you repeat that? You have salbutamol, Clenil... Uh, Cetraben and hydrocortisone. And hydrocortisone. So you have eczema also, yeah? What's that, sorry? You do have a history of eczema then? Um, my brother's asthmatic and my sister has eczema, um, and I've got a few issues, um, that I think could be eczema as well. Okay. Right. So coming back to your, um, you know, your shortness of breath, you've mentioned you're wheezy and you're coughing. Are you bringing up any phlegm at all? Um, no, I don't... Um, I'm not coughing up much sputum. Okay, no sputum, okay. Rightio. And, um, how are you using your, um, your Clenil? So are you using it every day? Um, I think I'm using that every day and the salbutamol just like as and when. So how are you using the Clenil? Is it twice a day? Um, yes, twice a day. Okay. And have you ever been admitted in hospital because your asthma was so bad? Um, no, I haven't. Okay. Rightio. When was the last time you had an asthma attack? Um, about three to four years ago. Three to four years ago. And what, what did the DP do at that time? Um, just, um, encouraged me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative. Okay, so you didn't have any ster- oral steroids or antibiotics? Not that I can remember. Okay. Um, okay. Have you ever had oral steroids in the past? Um, no. When was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse? Um, about two years ago. Okay, two years ago. Okay, but your asthma was pretty under control till, till now, isn't it? Uh, yes. Yes. Just in the last week. ... So do you do a peak flow meter at home? Peak flow reading where you blow into, you know? Do you do that? No? Um, just every now and then. I haven't done over the last... since I've had symptoms. Okay, so what was, wh- what's your peak flow reading when you're good? Like normal- Um- ... peak flow reading. Um, I think 100, 130. Okay, let's say it's about, um, 380. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Right, so that's your normal, yeah? Rightio. Mm-hmm. Okay, so what we need... Okay, do you have any allergies at all? Um, I have hay fever. Sorry, could you repeat that please? Sorry, I have hay fever. Hay- okay. Now, now any med- allergies to medication? Oh, no. Sorry. Okay, so you're not allergic to anything. Okay? So no allergies. Okay. Excellent. Rightio. So what we need to do that, obviously we, you haven't had an asthma check for some time and it looks like you can be having a small, small exacerbation. So what, I would like you to be seen by one of our GPs in the next few days. In the interim, what I'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when, okay? Mm-hmm. And use it maximum about every two to four, four hours. But if you're using it that often, that means pretty much that, you know, your asthma's really bad. You can use it, but that's not ideal. Yeah. The bl- uh, the brown inh- your Clenil, the brown inhaler, you can up the dose. If you're using just two puffs twice a day, you can increase it to four puffs twice a day. Yeah? Mm-hmm. And while, this is to do while you're waiting to see us. Okay. Now as I mentioned, you know, you're, you're doing what, you know, increase the, uh, Clenil to four puffs twice a day and you're using the asthma, you know, the blue inhalers every two to four hours and your breathing's getting really worse, then you would need to take yourself to A&E. You shouldn't wait for our appointment, okay? So when your doctor sees you, what we're going to do is we're gonna examine your chest. Yeah? Make you do the peak flow reading. So depending on what we find, you might need some antibiotics or some steroids. But anyway, while you're at home, we are going, by increasing your Clenil, we are increasing your steroid intake anyway. Okay. So, yeah. So any questions you wanted to ask me? Am I- No, that's everything, I think. Yeah. So book an appoint- call support, book an appointment to see and I will recommend that you do it face to face. In the interim, increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly. But if your breathing's getting worse and you've not seen us, do take yourself to A&E. All right? Okay. Okay. Thank you so much for your time. You're welcome. Take care then. Bye-bye. Bye now. Bye. Bye.
