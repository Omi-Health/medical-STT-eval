Hi there. I'm Dr. Smith from Babylon. Hi. Hi there. Can you just confirm your name, date of birth, and the first line of your address for us, if you will, please? Yeah. Uh, my name is- Okay. ... Valerie Paul. My date of birth is the 19th of September, 1993. My address is, uh, 64 Cliveden Place in South Wimbledon. Okay. Are you in a private place where you can have a confidential consultation today? Yes, I am. Yeah. What can I do for you? Um, I've been feeling really anxious over the past few months, and I just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house, and it started to really worry me and just add up and build up on that anxiety. And I just didn't know who to talk to, so I wanted to check with my GP. Okay. Do you mind just telling me a bit more about when it started? Do you think there's something which changed in your life at that time? Um, I guess so. I think, um, I would say maybe about two months or so I've been feeling like this, and that probably coincides with me starting a new job, um, which, uh, I would say it's quite str- I mean, every job is stressful, uh, when you first start, but it's been really stressful, I think, over the past two months, definitely. What's your job? Um, so I work for a, uh, a fashion retailer in, um, their head office team, and it's just a brand new sect- I've never worked in retail before. My boss is not very nice to me, um, but I also think that it's just been, I just really dread going there. I just hate speaking to her. I hate, like, seeing everyone, and really worried about whether I'm doing well or not. And it's really impacting on, like, on the rest of my life, like, my sleep and stuff like that. Okay. So, um, just day-to-day, tell me, from the start of your day, how it affects you. You said you, you, you dread going to work. Right. How, how does it affect you in terms of, like, your sleep at night and things like that? Yeah, certainly. So, I, I, I m- as I say, like, I don't want to go to work in the morning, so I just find no way of, I can't get out of bed, but it's also because when I leave, I just, when I've left work, I just feel so stressed and so worried about everything that I've done, I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours. So it- Okay. So, uh, un- what time do you go to bed at nighttime? About 10:00, 11:00. And what time do you get to sleep? Not for ages. I'm, I'm lying awake all night. Okay. Um, when you eventually get to sleep- Mm-hmm. ... do you wake up with your alarm in the morning? Or does something else wake you up before then? So I find my, my heart kind of racing, and then I'm just, like, panicking, uh, that I'm gonna be late and that that's gonna make work even more stressful. So I do have an alarm, but I find myself waking up before that because I'm just, my heart is racing. And actually, the other day, I was just, like, I was lying in bed and I really thought, my heart was racing so much, I thought I was gonna have a heart attack in the morning. Okay. And so how many hours sleep do you think you get a night? S- I just, I can't even tell because I feel like I'm, even when I'm in sleep, it's such a shallow sleep, but maybe three, four hours I'm getting now. Okay. And what about your eating patterns? Any change in how you're eating or whether your appetite's changed? Probably not significant changes. Maybe... No. I wouldn't say that, I wouldn't say that I'm eating, like, much differently, although I probably have more chocolate than normal just because I feel so down. Okay. You're eating regularly otherwise? Yeah. Okay. And you told me about the palpitations. Just tell me a bit more about that? Yeah. So, um, it's, it's usually kind of, like, when I realize in the morning that either, um, I feel like I'm gonna be late 'cause I've, like, overslept because I'm so tired, um, or I wake up in a panic thinking I'm gonna be late. So it's just kind of, like, just a constant, like, rapid heart beating. It's really, really stressful, but I don't know if it's stress or... But I did think it was, like, a heart problem initially. Does it feel like a regular fast beat or an irregular beat? Irregular, I think. And how long do you think it lasts for when you get it? Oh, it can be anything. I think it was like a couple of minutes, or the other day, I was actually just sort of lying there for, like, holding my hand on my chest for, like, 10 minutes. Okay. Is that something that you've had before this? Or is it a new thing? Yeah. I would say this is only in the past sort of, like, couple of months, as I say, that I've been experiencing this. Okay. Any chest pain with that? No. Um, well, yeah, it's painful t- when the heart, when my heart is beating fast, but- Okay. ... but yeah. And in the daytime, how, how, you said you, you're not getting much sleep, so how's your energy level in the daytime? It's just really, really low. I'm, uh, I'm finding now that I'm just, I find no enjoyment at all kind of day-to-day in anything that I'm doing. It's not just my job. It's, you know, when I leave, I'm just so tired that anything that previously was really fun is just not, it's not enjoyable. And I'm, uh, like, yeah, on edge the whole time. Okay. So what do you do in the evenings? Well, right now, I, I'm working so late because everything is really, really stressful, so I don't really get much time to myself, but when I do wanna go out or, you know, see friends or just relax, it, it seems quite difficult to do that. Okay, and d- are you avoiding contact with friends? Or do you still see them? I avoid them in so much that I feel like I'm... Yeah. So I mean, sometimes it just, I know that I'm not gonna have fun because I don't want to go out and...... do things that I wouldn't normally have done. Okay. What about hobbies or exercise or anything else outside work? Do you do anything else outside work? Yeah, as I say, like, everything that I've had previously been doing has been just difficult to continue with. Like, I did used to like to, like, go running and, um, to play tennis and stuff. But now, it's just not, I'm just not enjoying it. I'm not, I'm not, like, I'm not going out to do that quite so much. And have you, has it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work? No, 'cause I think that would just add to the tension. But I do, like, pretty much every morning I think, "I should call in sick," or like- Okay. ... just not go. And what's the worst that it's got? Have you ever been, um, so overwhelmed that you couldn't get into the office, you couldn't go into a situation? Yeah, um- Have you had a panic attack? No, I wouldn't say so. I think I've always managed to make it to work, but I, I wonder if it's building up. So this is why I wanted to talk, because I'm just worried it's building up to that, and I don't know what to do, because I've had, feel it, felt it get worse and worse over the past couple of months. Okay. And apart from work, are there any other situations which provoke quite extreme anxiety? Like, being in public places, social situations, public transport, anything like that? Yeah, I mean, I find public transport really stressful in a way, especially being on the Tube, 'cause it's quite, getting warmer, so it's just really airless. Um, but I think the majority of it, 'cause my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well. Okay. Before this, did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this? Not really. I, um, no. I would say, I mean, everybody always has a bit of tension, a bit of anxiety, but I've never felt anything this bad before. Okay. And what about your mood day-to-day? I mean, I can see that you're quite distressed by it, but do you ever- Yeah. ... get really down about this? Um, I mean, yeah, yeah. 'Cause I do, yeah. I'm pretty much down, like, I don't enjoy it, being at all because I'm just so worried about everything. Um, and I find that even when I'm not, like, even at the weekends and stuff, it's just the kind of, like, constant feeling of just being a bit down and a bit unhappy. When do you think you last felt yourself? Um, I don't know if that's a good question. I can't really, I can't really put a date on that at all. And has your mood ever been so low that you felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job or with your life or with your normal things as they were going on? I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't say that I've had, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any thoughts that have been that extreme. Like, I don't, you know, I have, I have a good support system. Like, I do have a good family and stuff, so I, I have, I don't have worries about actually wanting to, um, not go on. It's just that I don't wanna go on like this. (laughs) Yeah. Okay. And where do you, who do you live with at home? Sorry? Who do you live with at home? Yeah, I live with my parents. Just my parents. Um, and how much alcohol do you have in an average week, do you think? Um, hmm, I don't know. Probably quite a lot on the Friday or Saturday, just because that, that's kind of normal, um. Maybe I, maybe I do have, like, a bit during the week. Like, my parents obviously are retired, so they just drink whenever they want. So whenever they're having a glass of wine, they'll offer it to me, and like, I guess I don't really keep track of it that much. Okay. So how much would you, would you guess? Probably, like, probably quite a lot on Friday or Saturday, because it's usually going out. So maybe, like, I probably go over my limit just on those days anyway. And then, like, maybe a glass of wine during the week. Okay. You know? Do you smoke or take any other drugs or anything? Um, I try not to smoke. But I do occasionally. But I don't take drugs. Okay. And have you done any- anything yourself to help? Have you ha- have you talked to anyone, talked to any counselors? Done any online, looked online at all? Any ways... Um, I talked to my mom because she also suffers from, or she's suffered from, like, depression in the past. I didn't think that it was, that I was suffering from actual depression, because it just seems to be manifesting as, as total, as just stress the whole time. Okay. But, um, I did talk to my mom about it, but I haven't sought any... She recommended that I come to the GP. Okay. Um, but I haven't sought any other professional... And would you be happy to have some one-to-one therapy? Yeah, I think, yeah, I think so. I've never done that before, but yeah. Okay. Um, what we would suggest in the first instance is to, to start, you can self-refer via the NHS for what we call, like, talking therapies, type of cognitive behavioral therapy, where they can really look at your situation, how you're reacting to the... Right. ... what, what's provoking the anxiety and what you can do to try and overcome that. Um, so I can send you the link for that. Um, in the meantime, so it can be a bit of a wait, there are some online resources that are really helpful. Mm-hmm. I can put the details on there, and you can get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well. Um... Okay. And if you're feeling like it's not helping at all or your anxiety is getting worse to the point where you can't cope with work or you can't just do your normal things day-to-day, then it's important for us to, for you to give us a call back and just discuss that further. I mean, some people with anxiety, they do need to take medication to control that, but that's not something that we would suggest in the first instance. Okay. And I'll put some more information on your notes about helping with your sleep patterns and things like that. That's great. I look forward to reading it. Um, in terms of the palpitations- Mm-hmm. ... it is more likely to be associated with anxiety, but it's probably worth having a couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that there's not something triggering that off. And then arranging a GP follow-up the week after you've had the test so we can just go through the results with you. Okay, okay. Yeah. So if you call this hotline you can arrange the, have the blood test done. Okay. I'll call them up. Okay? Thank you so much. All right. T- take care. Have a good day. Bye. Sorry.
