Hi, there. Good morning. Hello. Good morning. Um, I'm Dr. Dean Mirza from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Okay. Before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth? Yes. Uh, my name is John Smith, and I was born on the 5th of April, uh, 1973. Okay. That's great. Thank you for that. Um, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes. Absolutely. Okay, great. Okay. So, um, tell me a bit about what's been happening. You said, you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow. Yeah. Um, I just noticed this, like, about a week ago or something, um, I had like a weird swelling on, on, on my elbow. I noticed that when I was in the shower. Uh, it's not painful at all or like... I, I feel, I feel fine but it's just, just a bit, a bit weird to see that. Um- Sure. ... it's, it's slightly warm, um, and I, I kind of feel like there's... It's a bit fluid in, inside or, um- Sure, sure. So I, I want to know what's going on with (Throat clearing) I'm sorry, did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow? Um, it's the, the left elbow. Left elbow, okay. A- and have you banged that elbow? Do you have any kind of injury? No, not really. Um, not that I know of. I haven't noticed anything. I can actually, like, move it normally. Um, it's just... I c- I can just see that it feels a bit strange. Sure, okay. But that's it. And, um, i- in terms of your job, do you do anything physical? Not really, no. I just, you know, sit at a desk, um... Right. Yeah. Okay. A- and, um, has this happened before? No. No, I haven't noticed that before. Um, I don't have any, like, history of, of seeing this. I don't remember (Throat clearing) Sure, okay. Uh, and can I, um, can I just double check? Has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that? Um, no. Well, I, I do... Well, I think, I think I have something like, uh, osteoarthrosis. Um, uh, uh, it sometimes kind of hurts, uh, my joints. But, uh, in my family, I'm not sure. Okay. No, no, no. Sure. S- so you said you think you've got ost- osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis? Um, yes. Yes, a few years ago. Okay. Was, was that a GP or a specialist or was it a physiotherapist? Uh, a GP, um, yeah. GP, okay. All right. Um, right. Can I just... Uh, sorry. Can I just double check how old you are, please? I'm, uh, 53. 53. Okay. Fantastic. All right. Um, and do you have any other illnesses at all? Um, well, not, not really, no. Um, I feel pretty... I'm, I'm allergic to, to peanuts (laughs) and- Right, okay. ... that's why I'm here. I have to say about my medical (Throat clearing)- Are, are you allergic to any medication? Uh, no. Not that I know of. Sure. A- and, um, do you, um... Are you on any medication on a regular basis? Uh, no. No, okay. And are you normally fit and well? Mobile, active? Yeah. I do, I do, uh, do some sports. I run regularly, like two, three times a week. Um, yeah. No, I'm... I think I'm healthy (laughs). Okay. Good, good. Glad to hear. Well done. That's g- good that you're doing that on a regular basis. Okay. Um, and, um, uh, can I... Is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now? Uh, yeah, sure. Okay, keep... Bear with me one second. Right, okay. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that, a bit higher, so I can just see the underside. Okay, fantastic. All right. And then just bring it round to this side. Essentially, I can see the other side. Okay, fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of the elbow with your fingers- Yeah. ... does it... Is it, is it hot compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin? It's a bit warm, yes. It's a bit warmer, okay. Um, and, um, is it very tender when you're pressing on that now? Does it... If you, if you give a press, does it hurt you at all? On the, on the tip of the elbow, it's, it's okay. Just, like, next to it, like, where the, the swelling is, it's a bit... Yeah, it feels a bit fluid. Okay. All right. Um, well, um, I noticed the skin was a bit dry, uh, on the tip of the elbow. Do, do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body? Uh, no, no. Yeah. That's (Throat clearing) normal skin. Very dry. Do you suffer from eczema at all? No. No. All right. Okay. So, um, what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem, okay, is, um, I think w- it would be worthwhile... Thi- this seems like, uh, what we call a bursitis. Okay? So that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacks around the joint. Um, what I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication- Okay. ... in the, in the first instance. And as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of, um, causes of joint swelling. Okay? So, um, what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some, um, blood test forms to be sent out to your house. And there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done. And that will involve you, um, having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies. So we'll do a full screen and we'll also check for things like gout as well. Okay? Okay. And, um, (throat clearing) the time frame for that will be, um, the results will come back to us after about five, six days, um, from now. Okay. It will take time for the forms to come out to you. And if you get the forms, get the tests done straight away.... by the time that we're expecting the result back, you know, one to two days after that, w- we're looking at maybe six days. And what I would suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you (clears throat) in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood tests, and we can, um, get a gauge as to, uh, what's going on. Now, in terms of your joint right now, it doesn't look like, to me, like something called, (smacks lips) excuse me, septic arthritis. So- Okay. ... we are worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint. Um- Okay. ... and your, your joint doesn't look like that. However, if your, the elbow was to become very red, very painful, uh, and the redness was to spread or become, uh, you know, more intense, then you need to get on the phone or get, have a video appointment with one, with one of us as soon as possible. Mm-hmm. 'Cause that would be an emergency, that would require more immediate assessment and more immediate treatment. Okay? Right. Do, do you think it's something dangerous, like something... Like, can- could I die from that or is it, is it- No, I don't think this is anything dangerous. You don't need to worry. Okay. Okay? What I'm doing is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to, to develop. Okay? Okay. So if things were to worsen... This, this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward. It's nothing s- sinister or life-threatening. Um, what I'm doing is I'm just saying in case things worsen, these are the things that we'd be looking out for and this is what we have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully, and I don't think you're going to have it. But I'm just saying the what-if scenario. Is that okay? Yeah, that, that sounds good. Thank you. All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me? Um, well, just yeah, re- I just wanted to know about this. Um, yeah, it feels a bit better now to know that. (laughs) Okay, all right. Um- Um, but yeah, no, that's it. Thank you. Okay. So I, I would take ibuprofen regularly, okay? You can get that over the counter. Um, that's 400 milligrams two times a day. And you should take, take that after food, not on an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it. Okay? Sure. All right. Yeah. So what I wanna do is I'll get the form sent out to you and, um, we are going to arrange a follow-up appointment maybe within a, um... Actually, you know, the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face-to-face. If it's more convenient for you do, to do it over the phone, we can do that over the phone, uh, over video. Okay. You can do that as well. That, that's your call. But you contact us a- after you've had the blood test done and we can review things then, okay? Okay, yeah, that sounds good. I, I, I will do that and if I see that it's getting worse, I'll probably ask for a physical appointment, but yeah. Sure, sure, that's a good idea. All right, then. Okay, um, take care then. So I'll- Thanks. Just, just leave that with me. I'll sort all those bits and pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll, we'll, um, review you after the tests if things go well. Thank you. All right. All right, then. Take care. All the best. Bye-bye. Bye.
