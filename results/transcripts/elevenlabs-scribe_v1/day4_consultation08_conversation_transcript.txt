Hello? Hey, there. Hi. Hi, there. Uh, my name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors at Babbelo. I just... Can I confirm your name, please? Hi. Yeah. Uh, my name is, uh, Brian. Sorry, what... Sorry, your name was? My name was Brian. Brian. Hi, Brian. Hi. Nice to... Um, uh, and your date of birth? Yeah. My date of birth is the 8th of August, 1982. Great. And, uh, are you in a sort of, uh, confidential place where you can speak freely? Yeah. No, no one else can hear me. Great. And you're happy to continue with the consultation? Yes. Marvelous. Okay. So, um, how can I help today? Yeah. Um, so basically it's just been happening over the last few weeks or so. But I don't really feel like, um, like, getting up in the morning's really difficult and I don't have much energy at all during the day. Um, often, yeah, just, like, doing most things that I would normally find easy, uh, is become quite difficult. Okay. So things have become quite difficult for you? Yeah. Is there anything else? Um, um, it's quite hard to say. Like, things like I'm not, not eating very much at the moment, so I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy. Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. Um, so you've had difficulty waking up, no energy, not eating. And that's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks, do you mean two or three or five? How, how does that... roughly? Well, now I come to think about it, maybe, maybe even longer. Um, I guess, uh, it might be related to... so I also started a new job, um, slightly recently. Um, it might have even coincidi- coincided with, uh, with that job a couple of months ago. When did you start your new job? Two months ago, you say? Yeah. Okay. And, um, so this has been going on perhaps for, um, sort of six weeks or so? More like two, two months I would say. Yeah. Okay. All right. So, um, is there anything that you're particularly sort of concerned about, um, or hoping to get out of this consultation? Well, um, I, I know that it's not really normal for me. So before this phase started happening, you know, I wouldn't have had, uh, any problems with eating what I want to eat or, you know, doing standard things in life. And, and what I want to do is to like kind of return to that previous state, uh, somehow. Um, I'm not sure how that is, uh, what, what the best ways of doing that are. Mm-hmm. But yeah, give some advice or whatever. That'd be really useful. Okay. Sure. Okay. Um, well, what, what I'd like to do is just ask you a few more sort of questions around what's been going on, um, and also around your background health and, um, and things like that. And then we can go on to sort of what, what can be done from there. Is that all right? Okay. Okay. Great. So, so you say you've been, um, feeling unwell with not a lot of energy, difficult waking up in the mornings. Do you tend to... just on that note, do you tend to wake up early and then stay in bed in the mornings? Um, actually, I'm just, uh, not, not really waking up early. It's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all probably. I think that's probably closer. So- There's d- difficulty sleeping as well? ... yeah. Um, and have you... and how, how has your mood been over this period? Have you been- Um. ... feeling your usual- Distracted, I, I'd say. Uh, I, I kind of, um, yeah, uh, finding it really hard to... quite difficult to keep focusing, I would say. Um, not unhappy or happy, but just, uh, quite d- just not focused. Okay. So difficulty focusing, quite distracted. And would you say you've i- been in good spirits or is your mood low? Um, actually, uh, now you, you mention it, like, my mood is a bit lower recently. Um, and so I've noticed like, uh, my sex drive has kind of decreased, um, a bit over the, the past few months as well. Right. So, yeah. Okay. And, uh, so lower mood, decreased sex drive recently as well. And just on that note, just a few questions around that. Are you able to, uh, maybe slightly personal questions, but if you're o- okay to answer these. Yeah. Do you tend to, to have morning erections? Like, are you... is that something that you've noticed re- Um, I haven't noticed anything like that specifically, no. So you've n- so you're saying you have not noticed morning erections. And usually you would, so it's a normal thing to have, uh, waking up in the morning- Yes. ... with something. But you have not noticed those recently? I have not noticed those recently. Okay. So, and that's been a change, has it? Um... important one, I don't think. Um- Sorry? Yeah. No, I don't think it's an important change, no. I, I... Sorry. Y- Y- Y- You don't think there's been a change there? (laughs) You- No, there hasn't been a change there. Oh, okay. Sorry. Right. Sorry. Okay. So, um-Just going back to the mood symptoms as well. Yeah. Uh, you've said you've had, uh, difficulty focusing, easily distracted. Your mood has been, uh, slightly lower with lower sex drive. Yep. Um, and in what way has your sex drive been lower? Uh, are you in a relationship at the moment? Yeah. I, I'm married. Um, I've been for many years. Mm-hmm. And, uh, yeah, just, um, over the last few months, just, uh, been disint- Disinterested? Frozen. Okay. Sorry, you froze there for a moment. Oh. Um- Yeah. So less interested as well. Okay. And- Yeah. ... just to ask you a few questions before we, uh, car- uh, wrap up is, uh, any significant past medical history? Um, so do you suffer from any, uh, mental health problems in the past or any, uh, physical health problems at all? No. Um, so in the past, um, I have, uh, a history of hyperthyroidism. Um- Hypo? Hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism. Yeah. Okay. So that's- Um- ... high thyroid, just to sort of confirm that. Sorry, can you say that again please? Hyper as in high, hyperthyroid. Hypo. Hypo, okay, hypothyroid. Thank you. Thank you. Um, yeah. Okay. And, uh, also in the past, I mean, I haven't had any kind of specific, uh, medical diagnoses along these lines, um, but there suspicion that it may have ha- had an impact on me. But my father has committed suicide, um, about 15 years ago. Okay. Okay. And, um, uh, do you take any medications? I had a, a drug history of thyroxine. Mm-hmm. So maybe, yes. Do you, do you continue to take thyroxine now? Yes. You do? You're, so you're taking thyroxine at the moment? Um, yes. Cool. And any drug allergies? Are you allergic to any medications? No, I have no, uh, medication allergies. No. No allergies. And you mentioned the, the suicide of your father 15 years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other, um, uh, significant family history of medical conditions or psychiatric conditions? No. No depression or anything like that running in your family or
