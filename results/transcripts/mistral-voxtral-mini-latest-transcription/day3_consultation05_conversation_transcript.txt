Okay. So you've mentioned that you're feeling dizzy, is it? Yes. Yeah, I'm feeling, yeah, I'm just feeling very sick. That's probably because I'm feeling dizzy. My room is sort of spinning. and I can't walk properly, well I can walk properly but not straight and my ears are buzzing a bit, feeling a bit off. Okay, ears buzzing. So when did it all start? Started probably about two hours ago maybe but I had it a similar sort of thing about a month ago but I didn't really think anything of it because it settled quite quickly. This has been going for a bit more now. Okay so you said you mentioned it started a few hours ago so when did it start? What were you doing? I was actually making my husband some breakfast and I just suddenly felt very fuzzy and dizzy and a bit shaky. Okay, so you mentioned the room spinning around? Yeah. Okay, and how long does it last for? Or is it there now continuously now? Yeah, it's there the whole time. So it's there now for the past two hours you'd say, yeah? Yeah. Okay.

You mentioned that you have some ear buzzing kind of thing. Any kind of ear pain or ear discharge, anything like that? No, nothing. Okay. Do you have a temperature at all? I don't think so. Okay, right. You also mentioned that you can walk but you're not walking straight. Why is that? Is it because... I think just because the room feels like it's moving a bit. It feels like the room. That's why you feel like you're a bit unsteady, yeah? My legs and arms and everything are working fine. I just... I don't feel like I'm stable, the room is spinning. So there's no weakness of your arms and legs, okay. No. Okay, right. So you mentioned you had something like this a month ago, so how long did that episode last for? Probably only about 5-10 minutes. Okay, right. And do you have any problems hearing at the moment? Like is it muffled or something? It's just a bit of a buzzy noise in my ears, but otherwise I can hear everything. Okay, right. So have you been physically sick? No, but I am feeling very sick. Nausea, okay. Right here. And I don't have much information of your past medical history.

Okay, and any other medications at all? No. Okay, do you have any allergies at all? No. Okay, right. Okay, so talking to you today, the most common diagnosis we would see or suffering from at the moment is something called labyrinthitis. Yeah, okay, that's when your middle ear, there is some inflammation going on there and there is some imbalances in the crystals there in your middle ear.
