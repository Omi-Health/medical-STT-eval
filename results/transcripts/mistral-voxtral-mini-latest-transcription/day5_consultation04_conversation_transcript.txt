Any abnormal discharge, other discharge or just this light bleeding? I just think there is no extra other vaginal discharge. Okay. Any difficulty breathing or pain in your shoulders or anything like that? No. And have you had a high temperature? Have you got a thermometer? No, I don't. It should be okay. Do you feel feverish? No. And do you feel faint when you stand up? No. What have you been doing for the last few days? Have you been at work as normal or had to stay at home? Yes, I have been. I'm doing my work, doing regular other activities like cooking and stuff, everything. It seems okay, just when I get the pain, it's just very bad. Okay, but you said the pain's constant there all the time, or is it getting worse from time to time? It is getting worse, yeah. Okay, have you had any other medical problems in the past? Yeah, I have allergy, I have amoxicillin. Pardon? Amoxicillin, allergy. Okay, anything else? Have you had any operations? No. Have you had any pregnancies?

No. Any pain or strong smell or having to go more often than normal? No, I don't really, I have noticed that I don't really go often like before. So, yeah, I do drink a lot though. Right, okay. And any weight loss or blood in the stool or urine? Yes, I have, as I said, I have some, I can see some discharge and bleeding, but then I don't, other than that, there is no discharge. Fine. I think... With the abdominal pain, as it's getting worse and it's been going on for the last few days, it would be very helpful to be able to examine you properly. Would you be happy to have an examination with the doctor? Yes. Okay. So what we can do is we can arrange a face-to-face examination where they can see you in a clinic and do an abdominal examination and advise further from them when we've got more of an idea what's causing the problem. Would you be happy to call the support line and arrange that appointment? Yes. Okay, that's fine. So we'll do that. In the meantime, if it gets a lot worse or you're not holding any fluids down, then we should see you before then. Did you say your pregnancy test was a month ago? Yes. Okay. And your implant on was just put in a year ago? Yes. The other thing we would need to do is to do a pregnancy test today if possible. I would do it. So if you can do that today and if it's positive, we need to see you straight away so it gives a call back. Okay, have you got any other questions? No, that's it. Right, okay. So if you call the support line and make an appointment, we'll go from there. Thank you, thanks.
