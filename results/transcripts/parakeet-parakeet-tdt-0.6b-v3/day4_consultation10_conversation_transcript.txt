Hello. Hello. Hi. How are you doing? Good, thank you. How are you? Fine, thanks. Yeah. I'm Joe. I'm one of the doctors at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? My name's Lizzie Irvine. 23rd of July 1995. Great. Thank you, Lizzie. And are you in a confidential and comfortable space to talk? Yeah, especially on a Friday. Comfortable. Great. How can I help? Yeah, just for the last couple of days. And I've had a bit of a temperature, so feeling quite like hot and sweaty. See? And it's yeah, I'm getting really uncomfortable. Okay, so you've been feeling uh nauseous. Um and you've had some pain in your lower tummy, or you say you've been feeling sick in your lower tummy? Yeah, it's more of an ache. So like an ache in my lower tummy. Okay. And then I think it's feeling hot and sweaty. Sometimes I think it's sickness, but yeah, a bit of an ache. Okay. So if it's um feeling hot, sweaty, unwell for three days, uh feeling sick, nausea, um, with an ache in your lower tummy. Any actual vomiting? Um, so yeah, no, just nauseous, no vomiting yet, luckily. And it's only been for a couple of days, but yeah. Two days, yeah. Okay. Um, and uh any problems with your water works or diarrhoea? No, so I'm I'm later on. I'm going to the loo a little bit more often than usual. Um I drink lots of water, but it does feel like more often. Um yeah, like nothing, nothing too out of the ordinary. Um and I was I was a little bit like um uh I don't know, constipated, I guess. Um about a week ago, but I'm okay now. Okay. So you've been cultivated a week ago, uh things uh you're having regular bowel motions now. You said you had a bit of diarrhea or a bit of watery, did you say? No, it was more like I was just a little bit bunged up, and then about a week ago that kind of cleared and I'm a normal now. Okay, and you're saying you're going you're drinking lots of water, you're going to the toilet more frequently for a wee. Is that yes, yeah, I'd say so. I I tend to drink a lot of water anyway, but I feel like I'm going to the toilet more. Any pain when you pass urine? Um, no, no pain. No stinging. Uh no, just it seems normal, yeah. Okay. And um and sort of no foul smelling urine or anything like that. Um no, nothing, nothing I can think of. No. You're having you're saying you're going a bit more frequently. Are you having to go with urgency to the toilet? Are we? No, there's no urgency. Um yeah, no pain or urgency, just yeah, being quite frequently, but it's all seeming normal. Yeah, I probably wouldn't have thought of it being linked, but yeah. Okay. All right. So you um so the main symptom is feeling sick. Uh with this, you've been feeling bunged up and this sort of pain in your tummy. Just to ask a few more questions about the pain in your tummy. Is it how would you describe the pain? Um it's yeah, it's like below my belly button. Um it's it's aching. Um it does make me feel nauseous. Um yeah, so it's kind of more like a I guess like in an a dull ache, um, just below the belly button, kind of yeah, here. Um and it's it is it constant or is it coming and going? Um it's yeah, it's feeling pretty constant over the last couple of days. Um just need to ask a few questions about uh your periods and stuff. Uh any chance you could be pregnant at the moment. Um I don't know. Um probably not. I don't think so. I'm very careful. Sexually active at the moment, yes, yeah. And um you mentioned about periods. I did notice a bit of um, I don't know, it's like not necessarily like spotting, but like in my my P is like a little, I suppose I think I thought it was my period, it's like a little bit pink. In your P, did you say your so your P is slightly red. Or slightly pink? Yeah, but I am kind of like due on my. I didn't know if that was like yeah, part of it. Okay. So when was your last menstrual period? Um around a month ago, yeah, three and uh three and a bit weeks ago. Uh okay. Um did you say you say you're sexually active? Are you using contraception? Yeah, I've got the arm the implants. Um one sexual partner, um regular regular or refreshable. Yeah. Um, just to go back to your symptom of uh constipation, can I just clarify when was the last time you had a bow motion? Uh yesterday. Okay, and uh do you feel like you are still quite bunged up at the moment? Um no, it seems to have cleared up. So I was about a week ago, but I'm okay, okay now the last few days. Yeah, it's been okay. Okay. All right, so you just to sort of confirm your symptoms, um you're feeling sort of sick, nauseous with tummy pain, which is fairly constant. Um how did the tummy pain come on suddenly or gradually? Um it's only been for the last two days. Um so I guess yeah, quite recently. So it's it's come on gradually, is it? Yeah. Not sudden onset. Okay. And uh your last menstrual period was just three and a bit weeks ago. Um and you but you say you've had some a little bit of spotting possibly before um in between periods or recently? Yeah, the last kind of week or so, yeah, the last couple of days really, but because I was due on, yeah, I I think yeah, just the last couple of days. Okay, and but you're expecting your period soon. Yes, yeah. Sure. Um okay, and just to uh ask a few questions. Are you uh do you have any other medical uh problems? Um I need to be aware of? Um I'm an allergic toxicillin? Allergic to moxicillin. Um but no other medical problems that you no, not that I'm aware of. Any drug allergies? Oh, you mentioned the moxicillin, but anything else? No, that's it. Um and do you take any medications at the moment? Um no, no medications, but I'm on the implants. I think it's called um implanon. Okay. Uh do you smoke? No. Okay. And uh do you live with uh alone with your partner? With my boyfriend. With your boyfriend. And um any other medical uh sorry, any uh diseases running your running in your family? Um not any that's spring to mind in my immediate family. Um my brother is a type one diabetic. Sure. Okay. Okay, great. So um is there anything that you're particularly concerned about with um this sort of nausea and uh the constipation? Um I don't know, it's just a really like really horrible ache. Um an obnause, hot, sweaty feeling. I'm not really sure why, yeah, why it's happening. Um the last couple of days, that's probably all that's getting comfortable. Yeah, anything that you'd hoped particularly to get out of having this consultation. Anything sorry? Was there anything that you'd hope to get out of having this specific consultation other than a diagnosis and getting better and you know being on the right track to feeling better? Yeah, no, that's kind of I just want to um back to normal, yeah. But a bit more comfortably, yeah, sure, sure. Okay, um so and then finally I I didn't ask you, do you have any discharge or anything like that from down below? Um no, no, no discharge. No discharge, okay. All right, so um I I I think uh this could be a few different things. It could just be simple constipation. Uh you mentioned that you were bunged up, but you did go yesterday, so it's um and your your bowel habits that you've been going regularly, uh, but you did mention that you were bunged up. Um, but there could be a few other things going on. I would quite like to uh see you to do some further to do an examination and to do some some tests as well. Um we need to definitely rule out pregnancy with you and possibly um do some other examinations or or sort of further tests. So would you be happy to actually see a GP face to face um soon today, ideally? Yes, yeah, yeah. Are you and you're feeling hot hot and sweaty? Have you been feeling um lightheaded at all or like you're going to faint? No, no, not like I'm gonna faint. Okay. All right. Well, we're just sort of tying up running out of time a little bit, but um, I'd really like to see you uh for some more uh examination and investigations. If in the meantime, but um between now and and me sort or a GP seeing you, you feel worse in any way, you get lightheaded, um, you uh you have you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you, um, then I think take them quite seriously and and see somebody more urgently if possible. Um okay, is that was there anything else that you want to talk about right now? I'm glad we've got the ball rolling of this, and uh we can um sort of see you again to take this a little bit further. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Really appreciate that. Okay. All right, thanks for your time. Cool. Okay. Cheers. Thanks. Bye.
