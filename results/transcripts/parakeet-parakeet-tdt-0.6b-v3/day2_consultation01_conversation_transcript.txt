Hi there, good morning. I'm Dr. Dean Meza from Babylon. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, can you hear you fine? Yeah, okay, great. Well, nice to see you this morning. Um before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth, please? Uh yeah. Uh Jack Smith, uh 31st October 1990. That's perfect, thank you, Jack. Um, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? I am, yes. Okay, great. So um tell me what's been going on. You're you've been saying there's a problem with your hearing, is that right? Yeah, so I just feel like I can't really hear as well as I used to, like my hearing's kind of deteriorating in some way. Right, okay. How long has this been going on for? Uh about six weeks. Six weeks, okay. Um and before that, have you had any hearing problem at all? Um I had something maybe about a year ago, but it only lasted a couple of days. It wasn't anything as long as this. So, okay, okay. And um in this six-week period, have you had anything else happen? Have you had any other ear symptoms at all? Um, I occasionally get like a ringing in my left ear, uh just on the one side. And um, there's actually been a few times when I felt kind of a bit sick or a bit dizzy as well. Right, okay. Uh and just to clarify, the difficulty you've got in hearing, is that both ears or just the left ear? Uh just the left ear, yeah. Alright, so your right ear is fine. It seems to be, yeah. Okay. So you've had ringing, difficulty hearing in your left ear, and feeling slightly sick. And that's been on and off for the six weeks, or is it continuous throughout that six weeks? Uh it's kind of on and off, like some things trigger it as well. So, for example, if I'm watching TV or I listen to music or something, that'll sell off the ringing at the ear. Right, okay. Um and um have you had any pain from the ear at all? Uh no, not actually. Okay. Any discharge coming out of the ear? No. No, okay. Um, have you have you been experiencing any fever? Uh not specifically apart from the dizziness and sickness I mentioned. Right, okay. And um has your ear been itchy at all? No. Okay. Now, do you use cotton wool buds to try and clean clean out wax from your ears? Uh no, I don't know. No, okay. Well, you you're right, you should we shouldn't be doing that. It doesn't clean out the wax, it pushes it back in. Alright. Um, the first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear. Okay. Okay. And just exclude the simple things. Simple things would might be wax. You know, someone might have impacted wax blocking the the tube going into the eardrum, which can lead to muffled hearing. Um if that's the case, that that's something that's easily fixable. But um, so we need to exclude that first, and then after that we can consider other potential possibilities. Um, and for that we need to have a look inside the eardrum. So um what I think we could do is um maybe if we book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics, it's not an emergency, it can be done within the next four or five days or so, okay. And then um what I'll do is I'll send a message to our admin team, I'll ask them to slot you in to uh in a clinic, one of our clinics in that time frame. You can come in and one of the GPs will just have a quick look down the ear, uh figure out whether there's a physical blockage or whether there's something else going on. Okay, okay. Um can I just double check? The dizziness that you've been getting, yeah, um, how severe is it? Uh nothing major, it's just kind of uh it's it's not the kind of dizziness you get with nausea, like uh not not proper room spinning or anything like that, but just just a little bit of kind of off balance and right, right, okay. Have you have you had any chest pain with it? No. No any palpitations, heart beating fast? Not that I'm around. Okay, fine, all right. Um so let's get your ear checked out. I think that would be the the most sensible thing to do. And then after that, we can we'll be uh a step closer to figuring out which way we're gonna go. It it might be that there's a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear, but we just need to exclude whether there's a physical blockage first and try and uh deal with that if that's the case. Okay. Um is that the uh sort of thing that can cause uh like this uh ringing I've got in my ear? Well you know the ringing that you've got that you've got something called tinnitus. Okay. Um and tinnitus is something actually that medicine doctors, we don't really understand it fully. We haven't uh you know, people can't give you a specific cause for why some patients get tinted and some patients don't. It can be triggered by a wide range of different things. And in fact, I'm glad that you mentioned that. What I might do in the time between now and when you come for the appointment, I'm going to uh put paste the link for a leaflet about tinnitus um in the notes for this appointment. I'd really appreciate it if you could start reading about it. Okay. And often that that uh awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are, and there are limited options. Um that helps us in in terms of conversation about what we do next, if your ear is clear, okay. So um I'm gonna paste a link to that, um and you can read about that, and what we'll do is we'll see you in about four or five days' time. It won't be with me, it'll be another GP, but they'll have my notes and they'll know exactly what what my question is, which is just uh check your ears. Is that okay? Yes, that's great. All right, great. So um bear with me five minutes, and then you can ring the support team. I'll leave the number in the notes of this appointment, ring them and then they'll slot you in, okay? Okay, brilliant. All right. If any if there's any problem, any issues uh bet between now and when the clinic appointment is, just book another appointment and you can speak to while we'll serve a video, okay? Okay. All right then, take care. Nice to see you this morning. Thank you. Okay, bye-bye.
