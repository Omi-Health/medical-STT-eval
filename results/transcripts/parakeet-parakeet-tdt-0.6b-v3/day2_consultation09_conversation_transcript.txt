And um yeah, I'm still here. Yes, sir. Uh so uh I'm a bit worried because I woke up this morning about an hour ago, and I couldn't move my left arm anymore. Okay. U and how is your arm right now? Um well like I feel no pain, but just uh can't move it. So you still can't move and and what time did you wake up? You said it was an hour. You sure about that? Yes. Okay. Um now can I just double check? Has this ever happened before? No. No, uh it's it's really the first time. Okay. And did you sleep anything in an awkward position or in a different bed or anything like that last night? Uh no, uh everything as usual. Okay. Um and um is there any discoloration in your hand? Um no. Okay. Um does your hand feel cold? No, really. The arm feels fine apart from me not be able to move it. Okay. And it's your on your left side. Have you had any symptoms in your left leg at all? No. But I feel a bit of tingling on the left side of my face. Right. Okay. And how long has that tingling been there for? Since I woke up since I started to feel the thing since the arm really stopped moving so an hour ago. Okay. Now I can't see you. It's this telephone appointment, but have you noticed any kind of asymmetry in your face, or does your face expression look different on one side compared to the other, or anything different at all? No, not really. It's just having like a bit of issues like uh I was trying to drink earlier and I dribble a bit and the tingling on on the left side. Okay, so um you had some difficulty swallowing, is that right? Um yeah. Okay. Any problems with your speech? Is your is your is your speech different to how it um sounds normally? Um yeah, it feels uh a bit harder. Uh it's more complicated, maybe maybe um a bit more slow. I need to think more about it. Okay. Is it anyone at home with you? Uh no. Okay. Um well, um, I'm w I'm concerned that some of the symptoms you've got may be um symptoms of a stroke. Okay. Wow. So um that's something that can be dealt with, but it needs to be dealt with as an emergency in the hospital. Okay, would should I call uh would you be able to call the ambulance for me? Yeah, I'm I'm happy to do that. Um what we need to do is to make sure that they've got access to you when you come. So um maybe you could uh leave the front door um unlocked to sit in the hallway. But I'm gonna arrange one of my colleagues next to me to um call an ambulance to your home address now. Okay, okay, thank you. But that's being done right now as we speak. Um while we're waiting for that, I'm just gonna ask you a few more questions. Is that okay? Sure. Okay. Do you have any other illnesses at all? Um I have uh type two diabetes and uh high blood pressure. Okay. And um are you on any medication for that? Um I'm taking m meltformin low certain and um low DP. Okay. Do you have any um uh allergies to any medication? Um only penicillin, I believe. Okay. Um are there any illnesses in your family at all? Uh my dad has got um heart disease.

All right. Um how are you feeling now? Have you got the symptoms right now still? The arm. Yes, yes. The arm still can't move, and I think the speech is getting a bit harder. Okay, alright. So the ambulance is on its way, alright. Um, and what they're gonna do is they'll probably take you down to um the local hospital, A, and then they'll they will ring through for the um the stroke doctor to assess you to see whether they can give you any kind of um treatment for that. Okay, so don't worry, they're they're on their way. Um, and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna stay on the line until they reach there just to make sure that you're okay. Okay, is there anything I should be doing now? Um not at the moment, no. Not at the moment. Just uh make sure that the the front door's open, sit in the hallway by the front door so that they've got access if needs be, if for any reason you can't open the front door, okay? Uh all right then. So I'll I'm just gonna stay on the line and we'll and we'll wait until the ambulance comes. Okay, I'm gonna go to the door. Okay then, alright. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, bye-bye.
