Oh, yeah, my name is Jessica Smith and I'm 19 years old. Okay. And how can I help you, Mrs. Smith? Um, yeah, so uh, I mean, this is this is a bit embarrassing, but it's it's kind of uh hurting when I when I use the bathroom when I pee. And um it's been going on for a few days, so I'm I'm a little bit worried about it. Uh not sure what to do. Right. Well, uh thank you for coming in, so hopefully we can help with your symptoms. Um you mentioned it started a few days ago. Um so can you tell me a bit more about that? What kind of pain it is that you're experiencing? Um it's it's not too bad. It's sort of like a stinging kind of pain. Um it's not like unbearable, but uh it's it's definitely uh it definitely bothers me when I pee. Um and uh yeah, I also maybe sometimes get some like pain kind of lowered down in my tummy when I when I go to the bathroom. Okay, okay. Yeah. And and uh the pain in your tummy, is it can you describe the fear the the pain to me? Is it cramping, burning, sharp? Um yeah, I don't know. Maybe uh sort of sort of cramping. I'm not really sure, but it's not like it's not like cramping like when I get when I have a period or something. It's like I don't know. Okay, yeah. Okay, um, fine. And have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal? Um not I don't think so. I haven't noticed it. No, okay, fine. Have you noticed any any funny color to your urine? So has it been uh any blood in your urine or have you noticed any other darkening of the urine? Um there was a little bit of blood earlier today, um, but besides that, not at all, no. Um it does kind of it it's kind of like doesn't smell very it smells a bit weird, I guess. Um, but no, not really anything uh anything drastic. Okay, fine, okay. Um right, let me just write a few notes down as well. Um you mentioned the tummy pain, that also started a few days ago. Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards the back or towards your flank, the sides? No, not really, no. No, okay, fine. With the symptoms, have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Uh no, not not at all. Okay, any fevers or temperatures? Sorry, uh any any fevers or temperatures? Sorry I didn't hear you. No, no, no fever. No fever, okay, fine. Sorry. Um, okay. Um in terms of your bowel, are your bowels working okay? Um I think so, yeah. Um any any diarrhea, loose stool? Uh no, not that I not that I've noticed at all. Okay, all right. And um, Jessica, sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions uh just to go get a full history. Um hope you don't want me asking are you currently sexually active? Uh yeah, I am. Okay, and that with a regular partner. Um yeah, so I I've had a boyfriend for about a couple months now, yeah. Fine, okay. Um have you noticed any other discharge from from down below? I haven't noticed anything. No, okay. When was your last um last STD screen? If if ever I don't think I've ever I don't think I've ever had one. Okay, fine. Um and uh do you use any form of contraception at all? Uh yeah, we use condoms. Use condoms, okay. And when was your last period? Uh a couple weeks ago. Is it any chance you could be pregnant, perhaps? Say again? Is it any chance you could be pregnant? Uh I don't think so. It's always worth asking uh young females like yourself. Um so if that obviously if you are worried about the pain um not getting any better, uh then I would always advise you doing a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. Okay. Um fine. So just moving on, moving on. Are you otherwise fitting well? Um yeah, I think I'm I'm feeling okay otherwise, yeah. And so by that I mean do you have any other medical problems, medical hit medical history? Um so in the past I've had some uh some IBS, um, but other than that I think no like uh no serious medical problems that seem yeah. Okay. Do you take any regular medications? Uh no. I did uh I did uh a little bit ago or a couple days ago try some uh over the counter bicarbonate to try and help with the pain, but it wasn't it wasn't really helping. Okay, so you've tried that and didn't help. Okay, alright. Um do you have your allergies to any medications? Uh yeah, I'm allergic to clindomycin. And what happens when you take clindamycin? Um I I get some like uh uh swelling, basically. It seems like a quite severe allergy to it. Is that right? Um okay. Fine. In terms of your family history, is there anything I should be aware of? Um related to kidneys, bladder, bowels, gut. Uh no, I don't think so. Not that I not anything I know about. Okay, alright. And tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's lives who's at home with you? Um, so I live in a live in a flat near my college with uh a couple like friends of mine. Uh so I'm I'm not like living at home or anything. Um sorry. Okay. And are you are are you working at Loon or are you a student? I'm a student. Okay, and what are you studying? Uh I'm studying biology. Okay, and how's that going? Um it's good, yeah. It's really it's really interesting. Uh learning about learning about how uh how the world works. Yeah. Great. Do you have any aspirations for the future in terms of careers? Uh I don't know. Maybe a doctor someday. You never know. We need doctors. Um what about smoking and alcohol? Do you drink much in a way of do you smoke or do you drink much away of alcohol? Uh I don't I don't smoke. Uh I do drink like on the weekends. So socially, okay. All right. Um, excellent. So um at this age I'll I'll proceed to examination. But um based on your story, um, just to summarize, really, it's the last three days you've been having a bit of burning pain on passing urine, a bit of crampy tummy pain lower down. Um essentially, but but no other fevers or back pain, uh, if I if I understand correctly. I think you probably do have what we call a simple UTI or urinary tract infection or bladder infection, um, which can be readily treated. So I'll give you a course of antibiotics today, something called either nitroferintoin or trimethoprin. Uh and it's normally a three-day course, uh so one tablet twice a day for three days, and that should hopefully help your symptoms. But I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids. Let's try and flush that you know that infection out of your body if we can. Um, you can try cranberry juice, that can sometimes help with your symptoms. Um, and if you're still not better by the end of this week, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me, and uh we can have another look at your symptoms. Okay, so speak three days of the medication and then wait a little bit. If it still doesn't go away, call back. Yeah, absolutely. And things to look out for would be you know, if you are having kind of high temperatures, back pain, um, just genuinely feeling more unwell, uh, you know, I do want to give you a call back because then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we want to avoid. So do do give me a call if you have any concerns, okay. Okay, is there is there anything like like should I be worried about like like not having sex or anything within the next week or anything like this? I mean, if you can try and avoid it, I think that'd be sensible. Um it's great at using barrier contraception. I recommend you to continue using barrier contraception, but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up, that'll probably be the best for you and your boyfriend. Okay, okay. All right. Uh that that makes sense. Great. Um okay, thank you so much. Very much wish you all the best. Yeah, thank you.
