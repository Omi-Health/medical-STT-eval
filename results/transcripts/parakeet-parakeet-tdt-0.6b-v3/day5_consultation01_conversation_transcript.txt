Uh no, no, I've been feeling fine actually. And have you been eating and drinking okay? Yeah, yeah, same as normal. Okay. And normally do you get any headaches? Uh no, not really. It's not something I've ever had before. Okay. And has it occurred at a particular time in your menstrual cycle? Um no, not particularly. My period was about a week ago. Right, okay. And how were you the day before it came on? Have you had any other symptoms like feeling feverish, preturning, runny nose, sore ears? No, not really any sort of cold symptoms, I think okay the day before. Okay. And at the moment, how are you feeling? Um it's still pretty bad. Um, yeah, still kind of thobbing. Yeah. Have you had any changes in your skin? No, skin's been fine. Have you checked your temperature at all? Have you got a thermometer at home? Um I haven't. Um I don't feel like I'm feverish, but I haven't checked. And any problems with weakness, tingling, numbness in your arms or legs? No, not at all. And what have you been doing since it came on? Have you been able to go to work or have you been at home? Um taking some painkillers, mainly been at home. Um, yeah, just kind of kind of seems to be worse when I'm in a light room or like sunlight, so I've kind of been staying in as much as possible. Okay. Does it get worse with any position that you're in? Is it worse when you lie flat or when you bend forward? Um no, I think I've generally been lying down, better that way. Any problems if you cough or sneeze? Uh no, but I haven't really got a cough or anything. Okay. Um can you just tell me a bit about your medical history in the past? Have you had any significant medical problems, any hospital admissions operations, anything like that? Uh no, not recently, nothing. Did you take any medication? Uh no, just contraception. And which contraception do you take? Uh microcinon. When did you start that one? Uh about six years ago. Do you get any side effects from it? Um not really. Um no not too much. Okay. And anyone in your family had any medical problems? Uh my mum had uh high blood pressure and she's got history of migraines. Okay. And have you had your blood pressure checked for your recently? Uh I haven't actually no. Have you had it checked when you've had the repeat prescription done? Yeah yeah so uh probably about six months ago. Do you know if there's been any problems with it? Um it's always been fine I think. Okay. Um and whereabouts whereabouts do you live at the moment? You've given me the all address do you who do you live with at home? Uh just with healthmates um spine okay and do you drink much alcohol day to day? Um okay a normal amount um probably you know a few drinks at the weekend okay and do you smoke? No. Did you take any other drugs of any sort? No so see what what tablets did you say you've been taking already? Sorry? What tablets have you been taking already for it? Uh just paracetamol um I'm allergic to aspirin so I haven't been taking that what happens when you get when you take aspirin um I just feel really sick. Okay and have you ever taken any non steroidal anti inflammatories like ibuprofen neproxin anything like that? Um I have in the past I haven't been taking it last year. Okay. Um so this headache is new to you, and you've you've not had regular headaches before. Yeah. What I would suggest is taking um some anti-inflammatories along with a paracetamol. Okay. Um as it you said you're eating, okay. Yeah, yeah, fine. I mean it from the sounds of it, it does sound quite like a migraine, but obviously you've had no history of that in the past. Um and is anything changed recently or any anything you've done recently might have triggered it? Uh not I can think of, um, maybe a bit a bit stressed out of work, that kind of thing. Yeah. Um, well, that would be the first thing to do is to take some anti-inflammatories along with a paracetamol, make sure you're really well hydrated, um, and see how that goes. And if if it isn't settling or it's getting worse, or you get any other change in your headache, um, or you're unwell with it with a high temperature, then we would certainly need to speak to you straight away about that. The other thing is if you if you're getting persistent um headaches or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle, or certain things seem to trigger these headaches, then it it would be worth having a further discussion about it to see whether we can work out if we can help that that longer term. Okay, brilliant, thank you. Um, I would try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked if you haven't had a chat for a while. Um to do is to have a thermometer at home so you can make sure that your temperature's okay. Yep. If you have a raised temperature or the headache's just getting worse, and we develop any rashes or anything like that, then we'd need to speak to you straight away. Yep, okay, that's brilliant. Okay, so I'll take the microphone and I'll um hopefully be a bit better in a day or two then. But yeah. Okay, so have you got any other questions? Uh no, that was it today. Okay. Okay, then we'll we'll we'll um speak to you again. Okay, brilliant. Thanks so much. Bye. Bye.
