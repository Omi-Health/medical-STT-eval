I need to stay close to the toilet, and um yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. Um and and when you say diarrhea, what do you mean by diarrhoea? Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often or are your stools more loose? Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stool going to the toilet quite often, um, and like some pain in my like lower stomach. Okay. And how many times a day are you going, let's say, over the last couple of days? Um, probably like six, seven times a day. Six, seven times a day. And you may mention it's mainly watery. Have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools? No, no blood. Yeah, just watery and loose stool. Okay. And you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well. Yep. Whereabouts is a pain is that clear. So it's like in my lower abdomen, so uh like um, yeah, just to one side. One side. And what side is that? Uh on the left side. Left side, okay. And can you describe the pain to me? Yeah, it feels um like a cramp, uh like a muscular cramp, and um yeah, I feel a bit weak and shaky. Okay. And does a pain is that is it there all the time or does it come and go? Uh it comes and goes. Does the pain move anywhere else? For example, towards your back? Um, no, just mainly in my stomach. Okay, fine. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well. What do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been having uh have you been feeling feverish, for example? Um yeah, it doesn't feel like uh yeah, I just mainly feel a weak. I haven't had a fever um at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started. So um yeah, around about three or four days ago. Did you measure your temperature then? Um Yeah, I I didn't measure my temperature no, but I felt um just a bit hot. Okay, okay. Any other symptoms like sweating or um light? Uh no. No. And uh any vomiting at all? Yeah, so um I vomited at the start of the symptoms, but now um I've stopped vomiting. You stopped vomiting, okay. And was your vomit? I know it's not nice to talk about, but was it just normal food colour? Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit. Yeah, and there was no blood in your vomit, is that right? No blood, no. No, okay. Um and um any any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhea, you mentioned the vomiting. Um anything else that comes to mind? Um I had a loss of appetite. Um I haven't been eating as much. Okay. Um, but I've been able to hold down fluids. Okay, so you're drinking fluids. Um what kind of foods have you managed to eat anything? Um, just soups and uh yeah, light foods like smoothies and yeah, liquid foods mainly. Okay, fine. Um, and so uh uh you started three days ago symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms uh to kick on? So for example, things like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people who would sing the symptoms? Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago. Um uh but other than that I've yeah, been uh eating normally. I think uh unusual, yeah. Do you remember where you ate? Um yeah, I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Okay. Anyone else unwell with similar symptoms? Um, so no one else in the family, so I have uh a wife and two kids and one um child was vomiting, but if they haven't got diarrhoea, there's no one with the same symptoms. Okay, okay, fine. Um right. And uh in terms of your your overall health, are you normally fitting well or um yeah, I mean other than um asthma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine. Okay. And is your asthma well controlled? Uh yeah, that's fine. Uh just yeah, use an inhaler and uh that's under control. Fine. And you don't have any other tummy problems, bowel problems I should be aware of? No. No. Okay. Um apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications? Uh no, no other medications. Okay, fine. And in terms of just your your day-to-day life, you said it's been affecting your life. Um in what way has it been affecting your life? Uh so I need to stay close to the toilet because I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Okay. Um yeah, other than that, it's uh the main concern. And have you are you currently working at the moment? Uh uh. Yeah, I I work uh work. Um I'm in accountants. Okay. Have you been going into work the last three days or have you been at home? Uh yeah, I've been going to work. Okay. That must be difficult for you then. Yeah, it's been quite difficult. Right. And you say you mentioned you live with a wife and two children, is that right? Yes. Yeah. All right. Um just a couple of other questions we need to ask. Uh um, do you smoke at all? Uh no, I don't smoke. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Uh no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. Okay. So um uh normally at this stage I'll actually um examine you if that's okay. But um but but having listened to your story, sir. I think uh um just to recap, you for the last three days you've been having loose stool diarrhea, a bit of tummy pain, mainly on the left-hand side, uh, and vomiting and feeling can be quite weak and nostalgic. Um you mentioned you're having this Chinese takeaway as well three days ago, and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. Okay. Um it seems like you may have something uh called gastroenteritis. Okay, which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your uh of your tummy. Umly caused by viruses, but it can be uh possibility of bacteria uh causing your symptoms. Um at this stage, uh what what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So uh I don't think you need anything like antibiotics, it's really just um making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids. Um there are things like diarlite you can get from the pharmacy, which uh it's um it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. Okay. Um and if you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would certainly recommend that in the first you know first couple of days. Yeah. Um if you are feeling feverish and weak, you know, taking some paracetamol, uh two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. I would certainly advise you to take some time at work, actually. I know you're quite keen to work, but um, I would say in the next two two to three days, um clears from your system, just take some time off and rest. Um you know if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in in three to four days, I'd like to come back and seeing you again. Okay, sure. Because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing symptoms. Yeah. Uh and we may need to do further tests like um kick taking a sample of your stool so we can test that. Um, etc. etc. Yeah, sure, yeah. How's that sound? That sounds great, yeah. Yeah. Do you have any questions for me? Um no, no further questions. No. Okay. Is it is the treatment plan clear? Uh yeah, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you. Great. Well, I wish you all the best. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Bye.
