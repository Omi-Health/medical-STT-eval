No. And it is there anything you think might have triggered this off? Have you been abroad anywhere? No, but then um my um my brother um has actually been having similar symptoms um for the past um few days as well, and he does say like everyone is cool scotty, so I I don't know that might that might be for him. So you've been in contact with him, have you? Yes. Okay. Um and any other medical problems? None that I'm not thorough. Have you had any other symptoms at the moment like rash? No, no rash. No, nothing um. Um any surgery before or abdominal problems or any other medical issues? Well, apart from the fact that this one is giving me abdominal pains, no previous abdominal pains before. Obviously, I get the odd um you know, menstrual cramps and all that, but you know, that's you know that comes and goes. Okay, and whereabouts is the pain that you're getting? Um, it's kind of like towards my naval area, like I can't touch my naval area, it's just so sore. And it gets yeah, towards like the center of my navel. Um and does the pain come and go? Yes, it does come when it comes, I feel the strong orchestra go to the to the loop and then sort of releases me and sort of like comes again, becomes an okay. Um and do you take any medication regularly? Well, I I take my my vitamins, actually vitamin D every day. That's about that's about all that I regularly take. And have you got a normal diet? Yeah, I've got uh I eat well normally. Right. Do you smoke or drink alcohol? Well, I don't smoke for you know I have a pint from time to time. And do you take any other drugs? No, like I said, I only take um vitamin um for my menstrual camps when it comes, maybe I might take a uh uh an eye protein just to eat the pain. And when was when was your last period?

Have you had to miss work because of this problem? Well, yes, I've had to actually work from home today. Um working from home today because I can I can't be out for work. Okay. That's actually and who do you live with at home? I live with my brother and my mom. Okay. Okay. And um have you tried anything yourself for this problem? Well, I've tried a home remedy. Um, I've tried the the ORS, you know, thing um above from my my local my local um um can you just repeat that? The ORS, the the salt sugar ORS um um mix, the salt sugar mix. Okay, and how often have you been taking that? I've taken that I've taken that like um three times a day for the past two days. Okay. Um and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off or getting worse or to be honest? I I I'm not getting any better because like I said, I've been I've been vomiting literally everything I take, so so I doubt that even that has had the chance to work. Okay. Um I mean it sounds like because your brothers had a similar thing, it sounds like it might be some an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got, which is usually caused by a virus, but it can be from something you've eaten as well. Um if the symptoms they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts. Um if the symptoms are continuing to get worse, the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough. Um sometimes you do require certain medication to help this if it's sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria. Um what I would say is probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not sun to ease off. I think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment. Okay. Um, and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated because if you're if you're not keeping fluid down, then you can get dehydrated. Um how do I how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even like drink water and throwing off everything? Yeah, so you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago, so you obviously still um hydrated enough to pass urine, but we um we should see you so that we can check your hydration and um get that sample sent off as soon as possible. Because if if you come into the clinic, you can send that sample off straight away, otherwise, we would have to post it out to you, which would take time. Oh, okay. So, when can I come to the clinic to have this done? Um, so we can we can make you an urgent appointment, um, and then you can you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration. Um, but if in the meantime you're feeling more unwell, then we would get you seen urgently in A. Okay. So you could call us back in the meantime. Okay, so what I'll do, yeah. If you could please book me the appointment and um yeah, I'll see how I feel um before the end of the day. Hopefully, I don't need to go to ANE and uh keep drinking, keep going with the rehydration salts with just tiny sips constantly to tr so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and and you vomit. So just tiny, tiny sips, but just keep going with it. Um, and just have very simple food if you're gonna have anything like toast or biscuit or something really light like that. Avoid um fruit, vegetables, um, milk, anything like that, which might just make it worse. Okay. Okay, so you're happy to book an appointment through the support line? Yes, please. Right, okay, we'll do that for you. Okay, take care. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.
