I think. Hello. Hi. Hi there. My name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors at Babylon. I just can I confirm your name, please? Hi. Yeah. My name is So what sorry, your name was name was Brian. Brian. Hi Brian. Nice. And your date of birth. Yeah, my date of birth is the 8th of August 1982. Great. And uh are you in a sort of uh confidential place where you can speak freely? Yeah, no, no one else can hear me. Great, and you're happy to continue with the consultation. Yes. Marvellous. Okay, so um how can I help today? Yeah, um, so basically it's just been happening over the last few weeks or so. But I don't really feel like um like getting up in the morning's really difficult, and I don't have much energy at all during the day. Um often yeah, just like doing most things that I would normally find easy, uh, is become quite difficult. Okay, so things have become quite difficult for you. Yeah. Is there anything else? Um it's quite hard to say like things like I'm not eating very much at the moment. I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy. Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. Um so you've had difficulty waking up, no energy, not eating. And that's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks, do you mean two or three or five? Well, now I kind of think about it maybe maybe even longer. Um I guess uh it might be related to it, so I also started a new job um slightly recently um it might have even coincided coincided with uh with that job a couple of months ago when did you start your new job two months ago do you say yeah okay and um so this has been going on perhaps for um sort of six weeks or so more like two two months I would say yeah okay all right so um is there anything that you're particularly sort of concerned about um or hoping to get out of this consultation well um I I know that it's not really normal for me so before this phase started happening you know I wouldn't have uh any problem sort of you know eating what I want to eat or you know doing standard things in life and and what I want to do is like kind of return to that previous state uh somehow um I'm not sure how that is uh what what the best ways of doing that are but yeah give some advice or whatever that'd be really useful. Okay sure okay um well what what I'd like to do is just ask you a few more sort of questions around what's been going on um and also around your background health and um things like that and then we can go on to sort of what what can be done from there. Is that all right? Okay. Okay, great. So you say you've been um feeling unwell with not a lot of energy, difficult waking up in the mornings. Do you tend to just on that note do you tend to wake up early and then stay in bed in the mornings? Actually I'm just uh not really waking up early, it's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all, probably. I think that's probably close. Difficulty sleeping as well. Yeah. And have you and how how has your mood been over this period? Have you been um feeling your usual distracted? I I'd say. Uh I I kind of um yeah, uh finding it really hard to quite difficulty focusing, I would say. Um not unhappy or happy, but just uh quite just not focused. Okay, so difficulty focusing, quite distracted. And would you say you've it been in good spirits or is your mood low? Um actually uh now you you mentioned it, like my mood is a bit lower recently. Um and so I've noticed like uh my sex drive has kind of decreased um a bit over the the past few months as well. So yeah. Okay. And uh so lower mood, decreased sex drive recently as well. And just on that note, just a few questions around that. Are you able to uh it maybe slightly personal questions, but if you're okay to answer these, do you tend to to have morning erections like you? Is that something that you've noticed recently? Um I haven't noticed anything like that specifically, no. So you've no so you're saying you have not noticed morning erections, and usually you would, so it's a normal thing to have uh waking up in the with something, but you have not noticed those recently. I have not noticed those recently. Okay, so and that's been a change, has it? Um important one, I don't think. Um sorry? Yeah. No, I don't think it's an important change. No. I sorry, are you you you you don't think there's been a change there? No, there hasn't been a change there. Oh, okay, sorry, right. Sorry. Okay, so um just going back to the mood symptoms as well. Um you've had uh difficulty focusing, easily distracted. Your mood has been um slightly lower with lower sex drive. Yeah. Um and in what way has your sex drive been lower? Uh are you in a relationship at the moment? Yeah, I I'm married. Um I've been fair for many years. And uh yeah, just um over the last few months, just uh in disinterest. Okay, sorry, you phrased there for a moment. Um so less interested as well. Okay, and just to ask you a few questions before we uh it uh wrap up is uh any significant past medical history? Um so do you suffer from any uh mental health problems in the past or any uh physical health problems? No? Um so in the past um I have uh a history of hypothyroidism. Um hypo. Hyperthyroidism? Hyperthyroid. Yeah. Okay, but that's um high thyroid, just to sort of confirm that. Sorry, can you say that again, please? Hyper, as in high, hyperthyroid. Hypo. Hypo, okay, hypothyroid, thank you. Thank you. Um yeah. And uh also in the past, I mean, I haven't had any kind of specific uh medical diagnoses along these lines. Um but there's suspicion that it may have uh had an impact on me, but my father has committed suicide um about 15 years ago. Okay, okay, and um uh do you take any medications? I have a drug history of thyroxine. So maybe yes. Do you do you continue to take thyroxin now? Yes. You do? You're so you're taking thyroxin at the moment. Um any drug allergies? Are you allergic to any medications? No, I have no uh medication allergies, no. No allergies. And you mentioned the the suicide of your father 15 years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other um uh significant family history of medical conditions or psychiatric conditions? No. No depression or anything like that running in the family or nothing, nothing of that sort. Okay. And your mother is is well, any brothers or sisters? Yeah, she's fine. Um I'm an only child. Um okay. So I just uh uh sorry, my slightly rounded question, but any uh change in your vision? No, no, nothing like that. Okay, and just to go back to your you're saying you had low mood. Some people who are who do have low mood uh and low sex drive can sometimes feel uh suicidal as well. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else? No, no, no, not really not really, no. And are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities that you have done in the past? Sometimes, I mean, I guess um most of the activities, but when I've been doing sports as well, um I I find sometimes it's quite difficult to breathe. Um I have some kind of like shortness of breath um when doing sports compared to maybe a couple of months ago. Okay, so you you've become more short of breath over the last few months. Yeah. Um and you've had uh okay, so uh any other things around there? So more fatigue, more shortness of breath um over the last few months? Um with a slow lower mood, decreased sex drive. Um is there just before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like to talk about? Um no, nothing specific, no. So um we're getting a little bit towards the end now, but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you. Um I would like to probably see you in person and do an examination, and and also we'd probably like to do some blood tests um as well. So do you think it'd be possible to see uh to book an appointment in the next few days uh with your GP or um that would be ideal, I think here. Um and then we can we could probably do some more uh do an examination and and do some investigations really to see what's going on here a little bit more. That makes sense, yeah. Is that all right? Yeah, that's very useful. Thank you. Um better to have some kind of plan. Um yeah, yeah, yeah. I think we I definitely think we need a plan here. Um it's been nice talking to you. I'm sorry we run out of time now, uh, but we've at least started the ball rolling with um some further investigations and tests. I'm glad that you're you know you're you'll you're although you have a low mood, um you're you're uh you're not feeling suicidal, just to confirm that. Um and you'll uh and uh we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some of your tiredness um and your other symptoms when we see you. Okay. Thank you very much for taking the time. Okay, thank you. Thanks.
