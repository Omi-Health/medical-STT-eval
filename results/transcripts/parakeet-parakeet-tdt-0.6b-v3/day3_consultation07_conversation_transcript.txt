Yes, uh yes, I have it. Uh I had eczema in the past. Okay, do you think this is similar to your usual eczema or is it worse? Uh I think it's it's yeah, it's gone worse like this past few days. Yeah, but you could be like something similar. So on your skin, is there any you know any of the patches uh areas? Mentioned it's quite so. Is it weeping?

Like you know, where it's the skin's very um thick and darkened areas? No, no, I don't think I don't think so. Okay, all right here. So you've mentioned you've got a history of eczema. So what do you do about it? What how do you keep it under control? Yeah, usually I use uh a cream called deprobase. Uh yeah. In the shower, I use uh something called dermal. Dermal, all right. And have you been using them recently or not? Yes, yes, I I use them. Use them every day. Yes, I there's no change in that. I didn't change any. Okay. Have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema? Um I'm not sure. Uh yes, yes, I uh yes. You've used steroids. Um but it it's not helping. Yeah, oh, so you're still using the steroids. Yeah, I tried. I tried. Which one are you using? The steroids? What's the name? I'm not sure. It's uh is it the over the counterbox? The box is not there. Okay, so is it like the over the L-the-counter ones? Sorry? Over the counter, hydrocortison. That does that ring a ball? Yeah. So you're using the hydrocortison. Yeah. Are you using any antihistamines at all? Uh no. No, no antihistamines. Okay. Right. Fine. Otherwise, other than the rash, you're feeling well in yourself. There's no temperature, no joint pains. Yeah? No joint pain. No. I realized I have tried also anti-histamine and didn't work. You've tried the antihistamines and didn't work. Okay, which one did you try? The one over the counter. Okay, so like Cetrocin, yeah. Yeah. Okay, that's fine. Right. Okay, so from what you're describing, it looks like you know it is quite widespread. Your eczema. Yeah? Because you're having it all over your chest and ha hands and things like that. Um so do you have any allergies to any medication at all? No, no allergies. No allergies, okay. And you don't other than eczema, you don't have uh any other medical condition? I I have uh asthma and uh in my family uh there is uh hypothyroidism and migraine. My mother has migraine. Mother has migraine, and what was the other one? I didn't understand. Who has hypothyroidism? My mother. Okay, so she has hypothyroidism. Okay, that's fine. Right here, you mentioned you have asthma. So what medications are you using for asthma? Um uh, you know, probably inhaler. The blue inhaler, so you don't you don't use it every day, so you just use it on and off, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Blue inhalers, but your breathing's all okay, yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. It's only when I have a flare. Sure. So what we need to do is obviously you've got extent, as I've mentioned, so extensive eczema. What we'll do is you need a couple of things because to keep you a bit comfortable, we'll you would probably need some antihistamines, which I'm going to prescribe. Also, you hydrocortisone is a baby steroids that you use for young children. You might probably need a bit more stronger one like betna weight or something like that. Okay, so we'll try that first. So I'm going to give it's called the antihistamine is called Fexaphenidine, and then we will try with some betna weight first. So it's like very small amount, like it's like one fingertip. Yeah, this much is is enough to cover your palms and your back of your hands, yeah. So it's very small amount. So that if you can imagine, you can cover with very small amount the whole body. Yeah. So use that. You have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks. Okay. Okay. If if there's no improvement, you need to get back to us, or if you have any kind of adverse reaction, like an allergic reaction, which is unlikely, but if it still happens, you need to get in touch with us. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. So what we're going to do is we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy. It looks like boots on the systems. Is that correct? Yeah? Yes. Yes. So I'll send it across to boots and it will be there for collect collecting. If things are getting worse in the next two weeks, call us beforehand. Otherwise, wait for two weeks, take the medication and the cream. You still need to continue on your emollients, like the dermal soap, and as well as the diproase. Yeah. So you still need to use those in the interim. Any questions at all? No, no questions. You take care then. Bye bye now. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
