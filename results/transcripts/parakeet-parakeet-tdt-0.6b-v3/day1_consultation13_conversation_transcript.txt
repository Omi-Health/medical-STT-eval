There's no delicate. Hi. Hello? Hi there. Hello there. Um thanks for thanks for being here. Um before I go any further, can I uh confirm your name and your age, please? Yes, it's um Adriana Katrangieva and I'm 26 year old. Okay. Adriana, how can I help you this afternoon? Well, I have this like really crazy headache that's been going on for a few days, and it really annoys me. Where when when did it exactly start this headache? Uh around three days ago, maybe. Three days ago, okay. And whereabouts in your head is this pain? Um it's basically like it kind of feels all over my head, but like mainly a um around my right eye. Um and is a headache there all the time or does it come and go? Um it's it's kinda comes and goes. Um but I mean it is there all the time, but like sometimes it's stronger. Okay, so it comes in point. Okay. And if I was to ask you on a scale of one to ten, um ten being the worst type of pain you ever had, how would you rate this headache? Uh it's probably uh eight. Hey, and if I was to ask you to describe the headache to me, um in terms of the nature of the pain, is it sharp, is it dull, is it crampy, is it throbbing? Um it's kinda it's dull, but sometimes it gets a bit sharper. So basically it like it developed gradually, I guess. It's like the first day it just started when I was at work, and by the end of the day it was like pretty pretty like it was a lot basically, and then I was thinking, okay, maybe I'll just go to sleep. Um then I woke up the next morning, like it was even even worse, basically. So you think the headache is getting worse at the last three days? Yeah. Okay. Have you tried anything which made the headache better? Um, so I tried uh ibuprofen. Um so I took like a few um for the last two days, basically. But it doesn't really help, no. In in the past it did help me, which is why I decided to try it. But okay, alright. And except for the headaches, any other symptoms at all? So for example, any problems with your eyesight or your vision? Not really, but just when it started, I I got this like weird shooting lights, and like now like light is quite annoying my eyes. So when you say annoying, does it hurt to look uh look at bright lights? Yeah, yeah, it hurts. So okay. And um have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision? Not loss of vision, I wouldn't say it's just like some lights from shooting lights basically. Okay. Any nausea or any vomiting? Um like basically I I'm sick with the headache, but I no vomiting. When you say sick, you mean you feel sick? Okay. Yeah, yeah, no vomiting. Okay. Any neck pain or neck stiffness? No. Okay, and any difficulty with speaking or um speech? No. Any difficulty with weakness in your arms and legs? No, it's hard to focus though. So I I had to take a couple of days off work actually. Oh really? Okay. Okay, no problem. Well, I'll I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on. Um recent head injuries at all. Uh no. Okay. And have you had anything like this before in the past? Yeah, I mean headaches, you mean. Or or similar similar to similar to this kind of headache, yeah. I mean, I had, but usually after I I take uh ibufrophen, it's kind of goes away. So but this time it's just not. It's not okay. Um any temperatures or fevers? No. Any rashes at all on your skin? No, not that I've noticed. Okay. And just moving forward, are you otherwise fit and well, Adriana? Am I what? Sorry? You fit and well? Do you have any other medical history? I think so. It's just a headache. Any history of migraines at all? Not myself. I've never had a migraine, but my sister and my mom have them uh quite frequently. Okay. Um fine. I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask do you take any regular medication? Uh no. Are you on the pill? No. Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medications? Not that I know of. Okay, so you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines. Yeah. Are they is that normally well controlled or are they um having difficulty controlling the symptoms? Um, so my sister's like better, like it's kinda it's very rare, but my mom's is like quite bad. Um, usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that, it's yeah. Takes her out for a few days basically. Um socially, tell me a bit more about your life outside of um outside of work. So who lives at home with you? Uh I live with housemates, so three of them. So we're four excellent. And are you working at the moment? You mentioned this in impacting on your work. Yeah, so I work well, I work in IT, so I work with computers a lot, so I it kind of is difficult to focus. Um I had to like reduce the uh brightness of my screen. Okay, do you wear glasses? Yes, I do. Have you had any uh have you had any recent eye check done? Eye test. No, uh I've been wearing them since I was five five year old. So for you to bear in mind if you feel like your eyes are straining. Um I always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Um stressed or anxious at work recently. Well, it's been a bit stressful kicking off on your project, but um yeah, nothing out of the ordinary really. Okay, alright. Great. Um regarding smoking or alcohol, do you drink or smoke at all? I socially smoke and I drink not only socially. Only socially. Right. Now um Adriana, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Have you have you read anything online or spoken to people? Um not really. Um I for first I thought it's stress, or maybe I didn't drink enough water because sometimes when I don't drink enough water, I I like get headaches. Um but I don't think that's it. And I'm like worried, it's I don't want it to be a migraine because I know what it's like from my mum and my sister, and it's really annoying, so I really don't want to have that. And I know it's genetic, so I've researched that, um, but I don't know if that is the case. So yeah, is it anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today? Yeah, maybe just kind of if you have any recommendations of I can take something stronger because apparently ibuprofen doesn't help me. Um usually it gets resolved if I have headache and like after like one or two days, but currently it it didn't help me. How many tablets did you take of ibuprofen? Uh three a day. Three a day, okay. Alright. Um, so uh Adriana, so um really what I think is going on here. I unfortunately I do think this could be a headache very similar to migraine. Um the reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it, given your mum and your sister also have migraines. I think it's something for us to think about. Um now I'm not saying it's gonna keep happening, but it may just be a one off, but it's certainly worth treating it today with some stronger analgesia or painkillers. Um now moving forward, we have some options which we can discuss. Uh, you try the ibuprofen. Now, my only worry is I'm not sure whether you're taking the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets three times a day. Oh, right. So there's definitely room for improvement there, or I can prescribe you something stronger like neproxin, which is another anti-inflammatory, which can be helpful. We can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or codeine, which might be helpful as well. Yeah, I think codine is what my mom takes for when she has um migraines. Okay. I think it's certainly worth making as I can give you a prescription for that today. Um with regards to um for the next few days, it may be worth keeping a headache diarrhea so we can try and work out what's you know if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse. Um you know, I'd like you to come back and see me in about uh a week's time, week to two weeks' time. If you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches, we can think about giving you medications as prophylactic, which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis. But we can have that discussion next time. Okay. Okay. In the meantime, if your headaches aren't getting any better or they're getting worse, um, you know, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner. Okay. Okay. So if you have any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs, or you're just not feeling very well, just give me a call and come back and see me. Okay. Alright. Great. Great. Well have a good day. Thank you, you two. Bye. Right.
