Hello. Hello, hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. How are you doing? I'm not feeling that great actually. All right. I can't see your face properly. Just yeah, that's it. That's good. Thank you. So I'm sorry to hear that, but just before we start, is it alright if you could confirm your name for me, please? I'm Mary Jane Gray. Data birth. Data birth um 1980. Okay. And your address for me, please. Um I live in on SW40NG. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Yeah. Okay. So you've mentioned that you're feeling dizzy, is it? You know, I'm your notes. Yes. Yeah, I'm feeling I'm yeah, I just feeling very sick. That's probably because I'm feeling dizzy. Um the room is sort of spinning. Um and I I can't I can't walk properly. Uh well, I can walk probably, but not straight. Um my ears are buzzing a bit. I'm just feeling a bit off. Okay, yeah, buzzing. So when did it all start? Started probably about two hours ago, maybe, but I I um I had it a similar sort of thing about a month ago. Um, but I didn't really think anything of it because it's it settled quite quickly. Um this has been going for a bit more now. Okay, so you said you mentioned it started a few hours ago. So how did it start? What were you doing? Um I was actually meeting my husband some breakfast. Um I yeah, I just suddenly felt very fuzzy and dizzy um and a bit shaky. Okay, so you mentioned like the room spinning around? Yeah. Okay. And is how long does it last for? Or is it there now continuously now? Yeah, it's it's there the whole time. So it's there now for the past two hours, you'd say, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Did you have any kind of viral illness in the recent past past couple of weeks? No. No cold, cough, nothing. No, I've been pretty healthy, I think. Um you mentioned that you have some year buzzing kind of thing. Any kind of year pain or year discharge, anything like that? No, nothing. Okay. Do you have a temperature at all? I don't think so. Um you also mentioned that you can walk, but you're not walking straight. Why is that? Is it because I think just because the room feels like it's moving a bit. Um feels like the room. That's why you feel like you're a bit unsteady, yeah. My my legs and arms and everything are working fine. I just I don't feel like I'm stable. My the room is spinning. So there's no weakness of your arms and legs. Okay. No. Okay. Right. Um, so you mentioned you had something like this a month ago. So how how how long did that episode last for? Probably only about five, ten minutes. Okay, right. And do you have any problems hearing at the moment? Like, is it muffled or something? It's just a bit of a buzzy noise in my ears, but otherwise I can hear everything. Okay, right here. Okay, so have you been physically sick? No, but I am feeling very sick. Nausea. Okay. Right here. And I don't have much information of your past medical history. So is there any medical conditions you like to tell me surgical medical conditions? Um, I've had premature ovarian failure. Um, and I've taken HRT. Okay. HRT and premature ovarian failure. Okay, and um any other medications at all? No. Okay. Do you have any allergies at all? No. Okay. Right. Okay, so talking to you today. Um, in the most the most common um, you know, diagnosis we would say we're suffering from at the moment is something called labyrinthitis. Yeah. Okay, that's when your middle ear there is some um some inflammation going on there and there is some imbalances in the crystals there in your middle ear. Okay. So what the most important treatment is actually giving you some kind of middle ear sedation so that you won't feel as if you're going around in a boat, kind of feeling. Okay, so that's what we need to start because to actually make you able to function a bit more, we'll start you on certain medications. I would still like you to be seen by one of our doctors to take a look inside your ears to just make sure. So this is like just symptomatic relief, like if you have a fever, we just give paracetamol. So just to you know, make you able to come and see one of the doctors and things like that. When while you're with the doctors, we'd like to do your blood pressure, just to examine your you know, you know, how you're walking and everything is okay okay while we're waiting while you're waiting on seeing the doctor if you develop any weakness of your legs or arms or or you know a sudden headache any of those symptoms or you start being violently sick with it then you know you would need to take yourself to AE. Okay but if not wait for the appointment wait for the doctor to examine you and we'll take it from there so I'll I'll send the uh prescription across to your pharmacy it looks like it's the Lloyd pharmacy on our system is that correct yeah yeah so we'll send you across that prescription um it's called sematyl yep it's one tablet three times a day so I'll give people about 10 days worth in the interim obviously in the next few days you'll get to see one of our doctors and we'll have to just take it from there. Okay thank you so much. Any questions at all? Um can you take do you need to take those tablets with food or can you just take them anytime? It doesn't really matter you can take it because sometimes you know you get the symptoms as soon as you wake up so probably you'll feel a bit sick to eat anything so we might as well just take the tablets. Okay that's great. Thank you so much that's so helpful. Just make sure you call support to book that appointment okay I will thank you very much. Bye
