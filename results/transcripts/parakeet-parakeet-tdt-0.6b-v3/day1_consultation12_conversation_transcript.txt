Alright. Any headaches or muscle pains? Not not really. No. Okay, alright. And you mentioned three days ago. What were you doing when the symptoms started? Are you aware of any triggers?

Who lives at home with you, sir? Oh, I I live alone. You live alone, okay. Are you currently working at the moment? Uh well, I haven't been able to work in the past few days, but yes, like even if it might be. What's your employment? What do you do for work? I'm a software engineer. Software engineer. Okay, alright. Have you taken time off work recently? Uh yes. Yes, I have. Uh these last three days I've been feeling really unwell, so I couldn't work. Okay, alright. And just last couple of questions was regarding your smoking and alcohol. Do you do either of those? Uh not really. I drink infrequently, like socially, let's say, and I don't smoke. Okay, alright. Um fine. So, uh Robert, um I think having listened to your story, I think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis. Okay. Uh which essentially is just a tummy bug. It's an infection of your your tummy. Um, and normally lasts for about three to five days and gets better. Alright. But things you can do to really help yourself get better soon um are you can drink plenty of fluids to really try and flush the toxins out of your body. Okay. You can get things from the pharmacy which are called diaralite, which can help replenish any vin uh minerals and vitamins you may have lost. Sorry, what's the name of that? It's called diarolite. Um it's uh it's a type of fluid replacement drink. Um you can take some paracetamol if you're feeling feverish and weak. I would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for the next day or two until you get better. Normally you have to be diarrhea-free for about 24 to 40 hours before you return back to work. Um let's see how the next few days go. And if you're still not better next week, I want you to come back and see me and we can have another look at your symptoms, okay? That sounds good. That sounds good. Uh thanks so much. Do you have any questions for me? Or um no, I think that's fine. Uh yeah, I'll I'll try to write and drink plenty of fluid, and I hope it goes away. Uh if it doesn't, I'll uh I'll call I'll call back. I really hope you get better soon. Thanks a lot. Thanks so much for your time. Bye-bye. Okay, bye.
