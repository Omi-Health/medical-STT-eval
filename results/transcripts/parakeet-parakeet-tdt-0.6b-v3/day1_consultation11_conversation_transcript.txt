Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me okay? I I can hear you, but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Um is that okay? Am I meant to just connection on the screen? It's audio. No, no, it's absolutely fine. Um, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? Um, so um so my name is uh Dan Chowdry. I am seven twenty-seven. Twenty-seven, okay. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan? Um so I've just um been having some troubles basically in the it it's uh I guess it's been a little while now, and I've just been feeling not so great, and it's all come from like uh it's like basically I think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out like loads of it. Like I I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it yeah, it doesn't feel very solid. It's so just it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's uh yeah, it's just uh not not being very pleasant, and like I just it just kind of hasn't doesn't feel like it's getting better. So wow, no, sorry to hear that seems like there's a lot going on there. Well, when did it all start? Your symptoms? Um so I think it was a few when I think about it, so Monday, Tuesday, I I saw I think it was about three, it's been about three days now. Okay, and is it mainly diarrhea? So you mentioned watery stools. Um how many times are you going a day, would you say? Um so I I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Um you're losing a lot of fluid there. Yeah, so I mean I'm dr I'm trying to drink a lot of water, but um, yeah, it's just quite a lot and uh it's yeah I I think I I I feel like it's just just fluids coming out. Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stools? Um so I no I don't I don't remember anything like no I I think it's just uh nothing like that. There's nothing like that. And any any tummy pain any any any pain in your tummy with Yeah I mean I it I feel I feel a cramp and then and then I know it's time to go right so I uh around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go. So yeah I mean that's that's the f kind of the first sign. Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? It's kind of as I want to if I think about it it's like it's like at the bottom I don't know if that makes sense. Um well why do we start with is it is it in the middle or is it to one particular side? Um I I think if it feels pretty s like in the middle to me, not on any side left to right. Okay. And is this pain come and go or is it there constantly? Um it it comes and goes. It comes and goes. Fine. Okay. And if I was asking a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you've ever had how bad is this pain? Okay, so like so what do you mean by uh pain? So I I think it's maybe uh is it is this pain that's making you double over is ten is it ten out of 10 the worst pain you've ever had, or is it more of a kind of a mild pain, like a three out of ten? I I guess so I'm when I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it. So I can still sit down and uh I can still like cover it up and people don't really notice. So I I don't know what that means, but maybe is that like a six or a seven? It's always six, I think. Okay, okay. All right, good. Um apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Um yeah, I definitely I definitely feel kind of nauseous. Um like I and like I've have vomited. Um when I like I think it's maybe something to do with like whenever I have like milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit and actually like yeah, one time I just like had some milk and I just completely vomited it. Not eating okay, alright. I've been trying to avoid it, but um, yeah. The vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea, is that right? Um sorry, could you repeat that? The the vomiting is not as uh prominent as the diarrhea, is that right? Uh no, no, it's not. Okay, okay, alright. Um any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? Um, so I yeah, I think I am pretty I feel kind of really hot all the time and um I pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that, but it's uh yeah, I've I've Okay. Sure I'm I'm not uh like not a normal temperature. Okay, so you're feeling hot, okay. And in terms of your water works, are you passing urine okay? Um yeah, but I guess less frequently, maybe. Um, but yeah, it seems to be okay. Okay, alright. Um fine. And and you said that mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you, for example, gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else and with diarrhea, for example? Um, so I know so my um my brother has had actually had something like this for um five he has it as well for five days as well. Um and I I'm not yeah, I d I can't think of what what the trigger is for me. I mean my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me, but I yeah, I that's why is your brother now better? Um he so he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not I'm not really sure. He said he said he had he's had something for a little while as well. Okay, all right. Are you having anything to eat or drink? Uh I can see you're drinking your coffee, but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? Um so it just feels like um the the fluids do go down, but it just feels like it's going straight through. Just feels like it's going straight through. Okay, alright, fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat? Uh which cap which uh which you kept in? Um so I had some I mean I had some lunch today. Um but again it just it did just came come out pretty loose. Okay, alright. Um and and Dan, moving forward, are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical history? Um so I um yeah, I think I think otherwise I'm fitting well. I um yeah, I mean I I'm an okay weight and um I I can't think of any related medical history. Um I mean like my Yeah, I d no, I d I don't think so. Well take it you don't take any regular medications then. So I um no, I mean I I've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately, but uh I haven't been I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications? Um so I don't have any allergies that I know of. Okay. Um what about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? Um bowel so would would bowel like just is the colon like something? Yeah, yeah. So what I mean by bowel is a whole gut, really, anything from the memo or so my yeah, my my dad actually has um colon cancer at the moment. Oh dear, I'm very sorry to hear that. How is he? So um from what I heard, he's kind of so I don't I don't speak to him that often. So I don't I don't know the exact details and I I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing, but um he's sort of in his third stage. Uh I'm not sure what that means exactly. Um so uh yeah, it's it's um he's yeah you can I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting me a lot and um that sort of thing. So he's quite I I guess he's um had it for a little while now. Well, I'm resorting out I'll make a note of though because uh it's always important to know these kind of details. Um and socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan? Um, so uh not my brother, he doesn't live with me. I'm I live with my um sister and my mum. Okay. And uh how are things at home? Um in what sense do you mean that? In general, day-to-day life are you managing okay? Any particular? I mean uh I think uh yeah it's been it's been tricky um going to work with all of this. Um I dislike um taking time off work. I feel like I I just want to go um when I can so I I try and go. Um I think uh at home, uh yeah, I just haven't really um I I don't normally actually um eat with my family. I normally buying stuff and that kind of thing. So I don't think it's affected them and I haven't really been I haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mum about it. Um yeah, I'd I'd just rather deal with these things. Um so you mentioned work you mentioned work, what is it you do for work? Um so I work at a I I work at um an office um in central London. Um it's uh so I work in government. Government, okay. So I'll okay, right. Just a couple of last final coup uh a couple of questions uh smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Um so I I smoke um I smoke uh uh for like socially but not like regularly. Um so normally if if it's uh a Friday or something like that, I might I might have a cigarette or something like that. But um sorry? And alcohol? So alcohol, um I you know I might have a a beer during the weekdays, maybe uh not that many, maybe um but not on Fridays I have more um alcohol. Um but yeah uh buy a lot more units. Um I suppose um not every week, but maybe uh once or twice a month that yeah, I I'll go out with my friends and drink a lot, so that that's um yeah. Well thank you for hearing me, that's very helpful to know. So um Dan, just as a uh conclusion, uh just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis. Okay. There's nothing to worry about. I'll um I I I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days, just like I did for your brother. Drink make sure you drink plenty of fluids, okay? Um you can I just drink like normal water. I just feel like every time I drink water it's just coming out. Um probably best, but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. Um so you can get things like dirolyte, which is um a fluid replacement we can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth rec uh recommending that. Do I need like a prescription for that? No, you can just get that over the counter. Okay. Um you can try just you know regular paracetamol if you are being feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so 48 hours, I want you to give me a call back because um, you know, if you are getting dehydrated, then we need to do further investigations, okay? But I think let's let's see how you are in the next one to two days. Okay. And uh we'll catch up soon, okay? Okay, so you're saying that I should I I could uh I'll try and buy this diary. What what should I do in terms of um food and that kind of thing? Should I just focus on fluids? Food dissolve, yeah, absolutely. It's a clear fluids, you can use soft diet, things like soup, mash, and then gradually build up um as much as your body can tolerate. Um but really let's try and keep us off well hydrated first, okay? Okay, is it okay for me to carry on having like um paracetamol and things like that? Yeah, absolutely. If you are having if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think paracetamol is very sensible. Okay. Okay, try and s avoid alcohol if you can. Uh okay, I'll try. Yeah. Okay. All right, Dan. Okay. Thank you for your help. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks for helping me out. Bye bye now. Okay.
