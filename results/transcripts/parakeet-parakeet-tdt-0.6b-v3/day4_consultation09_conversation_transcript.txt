Well hello. Hi. Hi, how you doing? Uh my name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I confirm your name, please? Yeah, sure. Daniel Reban. Hi Daniel. And your date of birth? Yeah, May 11th, 1992. 92. Okay, Daniel. And uh are you in a uh comfortable and confidential place at all? Yeah, totally. Happy to go ahead. Great. How can I help? Um yeah, I just my chest has been feeling really tight. Okay. And how long has this been going on for, Daniel? Uh for about three hours now. Okay. And so tight chest for three hours. Um, and so you're born in 92, so it makes you 26. Um 26, yeah. And you are uh any shortness of breath at all like that? Yeah, like a little bit. Um yeah, a little bit shorter breath, not too bad. Uh any cough, wheeze. Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well. Tight cough, yeah. Yeah. Sore throat, runny nose, sore ears. You know, I had a cold last week, and it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose, uh just feeling under the weather. You're feeling better now other than the tight chest? I mean, I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore. Right. Okay, okay, but you know you've got this this and so you've still got still got uh symptoms of a cold essentially. Yeah, the cough's kind of stuck around. Uh oh, yeah, okay. Are you coughing up anything? Uh no. And um do you have any other medical problems like asthma? Yeah, yeah, I have asthma. I've had it for a while now. Um and then I have like a hay fever, you know, some allergies, just uh dust and stuff like that. Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any any medications? Um yeah. So uh you know the um uh ventilin, it's called uh salbutamol. Yeah. I got that one, and then I have a steroid, uh clenol, clenol inhaler. Yeah, yeah. And um uh have you been using clenol and the ventilin? And how often you've been using them. Um well to be honest, I was away at uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me, so I haven't really in the past week. Both of them. Because um sorry, they ran out and I I forgot to go and grab the next one. Yeah, sure. About a week ago. Okay. All right, all right. So so you so you've you haven't got any clinal or any ventilin at the moment? Not with me right now, no, I ran out. Okay, all right. Um any drug allergies that you know of? No, no, not allergic to anything. Just like just the dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs. Okay, great. Now, uh do you anyone in your family had any medical problems you know of? Um yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Oh, when I was young, I also had eczema, and I had uh milk protein allergy when I was young too. Okay. Um just uh do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or um hopes for this consultation? Um not really. Like I feel like asthma's probably a part of it, and probably getting my inhalers wouldn't be helpful. Um it's just kind of scary because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight uh in a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I can I can imagine. Um, it certainly sounds like uh you've you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough, um, and it's non-productive cough and you're short of breath. Uh is the cough worse at night time? I mean it gets a little bit worse at night, but basically just pretty consistent. Yeah. It hasn't gone away. Okay. And you've got this tight tight chest. But you even say you've got chest pain, there's more a tight chest, is that no, not really pain. It's more like tight. It just feels like sometimes you guys can't get a full breath in, you know? Yeah, sure. Um, okay. Well, I I would quite like to uh certainly get you some uh ventilin, clonal modulate. Have you had asthma exacerpations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit more, like back in high school. Um, but I've been pretty good at taking my met my inhalers, so not not so much anymore. Have you ever been to hospital uh as an inpatient, as in you know, stayed in there overnight for asthma? Yeah, when I was in high school I had to have a tube put down my throat. Oh, okay. So you so you so you uh you had you went to hospital and had a uh you so you stayed in hospital for a few days did you with an asthma exacerbation yeah I did yeah okay but currently you're just on ventilin and clinol and you haven't got any of those direct uh those inhalers at the moment I'd be pretty good I'd be pretty good just on the clinal and the subutal okay when sorry how old were you when you had that severe asthma extirpation uh I think I was like 17 16 maybe sure okay um just to quantify how short of breath you are um I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you no you won't have will you yeah um are you able to like walk up flight of stairs okay walk on the flat okay without getting too short of breath or um are you short of breath of rest? Uh I'm definitely not short of breath at rest like except for that feeling I was describing it does when I'm walking upstairs I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be. Sure. Yeah okay but you're not short of breath at rest at the moment. No no no I'm not okay fine. So what what I think um and just just to go over is there anything you would hoped about getting other than the uh a prescription for your inhalers was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting from this well I just want to know that I'm okay to just like keep I just don't want to have to get um that that intubation again. Sure yeah no absolutely well I'm really glad you've talked to me today. I think what we can do is is give you a prescription for uh some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within the hour, I would hope. Um, and uh I think what the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So this is these are tablets which um you can take for five days, uh two tablets in the morning, and uh that should just dampen down your asthmatic response. Okay. Okay. Um now there are some side effects to the steroids, which I should really tell you about, but please read the label that's associated with don't be too worried about the side effects. There are uncommon most you know, most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated. And uh you probably do you have you had them in the past, do you know of? Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Have you had steroids in the past? Um I can't remember, probably. Probably, yeah, I would like to, yeah. So um they they can come, they can make you your mood change, can be slightly low or too slightly high, can give you a high blood sugar. Um and uh okay, they can also cause rash nausea, um headaches, but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help your acid an awful lot. Um what I like to do is is send you these the some prescriptions for your uh inhalers are ongoing, so you um you can once you get better from this asthma attack, you can you can use the clinal modulate in the morning with ventilin as a PRN, but so uh a ventilin when you need to, um when you're getting ready. If you should start to use the ventilin more than uh every three hours uh uh at any time, it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So um see a doctor in some capacity. Uh and the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Have you do you know what spacer is? Have you used one before? Yeah, yeah. I somebody taught me how to use one a while ago. I don't I don't really use it to be honest. But have you got one? I think I do. I have one somewhere. Okay, all right. Well, um I'll send you another one, and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially uh a couple of puffs to prime it inside, breathing in and out, um uh for five or five or ten breaths. Okay, uh yeah. So uh was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage? I think you got me covered. Okay, um, and uh might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but uh I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better if you're okay with that. Thanks. Alright. Alrighty. Well, thank you very much. No worries, any deterioration in your symptoms like worsening shortness of breath, um, or just generally concerning symptoms, uh pain in the chest, tightness, uh feeling lightheaded, uh, then seek further medical attention anytime, please. Okay. Alright, sounds good. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.
