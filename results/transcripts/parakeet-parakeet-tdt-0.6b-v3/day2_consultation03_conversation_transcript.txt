Um, do you have any other illnesses at all? Um I've well I've got kind of been told I had polyps in my nose in the past and occasionally get some kind of heart burning feeling. Um that's all fine, and you know, I take a Renese if I need to, and if my polyps are playing up, I've got a spray. Um other than that, I think they said ages ago I had something called quite remember, but flabrentitis, something like that, but again, nothing, nothing on the telephone. Sure, okay. So are you on any regular medication? You mentioned the spray for your nose? Yeah, so no, I I only take the spray for my nose when I need it for and um sometimes take over like Renese, but I just get that from the chemist. Sure. And and the spray for your nose, where do you get that from? Is that from a doctor? Uh yeah, they gave me a prescription ages ago. Yeah. Do you remember the name of the spray at all? Unfortunately, I don't know, sorry. That's all right, that's good. Uh and you're not on any other medication at all? No. No, okay. Do you have any uh any allergies to any medication? Uh no, just latex. Latex, okay, all right, that's good to know. Um, and um in terms of your family, are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all? My brother had neurofibromatosis, I think it is. Right. Um other than that, everyone else is okay. Okay, good. That's good to hear. Um, and in in terms of your own kind of background now, are you are you working at the moment? Yeah, so I'm a I'm a jockey. Um, but because of all the kind of the symptoms of the game, especially sometimes when I get a ringing, I can feel a bit dizzy. Um I've just had to do far less training. So kind of beginning to yeah, impacting work um a little bit now. Okay, so you have to execute. You mean jockey like with horses, is that what you're talking about? Yeah, all right, okay, okay, fine. Um, great. Um uh and uh do you live alone? Um I uh live with my partner. Oh, okay, right. Um, do you have any pets at all at home? No, no pets. Okay, fine, fantastic. All right. Um is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what's been ha going on recently? Um no, just like like I said, like the ringing um occasionally, and when I get that, I can sometimes feel a bit busy, but the main thing is really the lack of hearing and the numbness that's got me up to life. Yeah, no idea what's going on there. Okay, fine, all right. Um so w what what I think we go on. So just like there was one thing I think that's because I can panic and you can look online and get a bit frantic. I I guess what I'm trying to think is, you know, is there something particularly serious that you know will need to be sorted and obviously reading anything because make you really frantic is it nothing so serious I will die from it. I don't know. I just I think I'll be able to do that. So um uh obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via a video uh portal, but um from what you've told me, this doesn't seem to be you know anything um that you're gonna die from. However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today. Okay, I would like you to come into one of my clinics, I'd I'd like uh GP to assess you. What what you what you're describing might be something called bell palsy. Yeah. Um we can go into that explaining what that is if um if that's confirmed on on physical examination. Um that's not usually a life-threatening problem, but um part of the reason why I'd like you to come in is just that we can just do uh uh what we call a a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on and confirm whether that might be the diagnosis. Have a look have a look inside the ear, see if there's any pro anything to see within the ear. So um uh so in answer to your question, no, I don't think that you need to worry about that. I I think you know, preliminarily I can I can reassure you. However, do you know to in order to definitively reassure you? I think you need a physical examination today. Okay. So so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send a message to our admin team. I'll ask them to book you in for a face to face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics um within central London. Okay, and then you can ring the su the support team number. I'll leave that number in your notes. You can bring them after five minutes and then they'll slot you into a place that's convenient for you, okay? That's fine. All right. So someone will will see you and hopefully we'll be able to reassure you further. But please make sure the appointment gets done today. Okay, yeah, they will do. That's fine. Thank you very much. All right then. Okay, nice to see you. Take care then. Bye-bye. Bye.
