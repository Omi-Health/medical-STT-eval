Is that I I don't know, I can just sort of feel it. Sure, you know, um, but I've I've also I've been feeling a bit like a bit tired at work. Haven't really been like exercising has been a bit difficult because I've been feeling tired. Um and yeah, performing performing daily activities has has been a bit harder than usual. Okay, all right. And um how long has that been for the tiredness and you know not wanting to exercise? Um only after only for a couple of weeks or so. A couple of weeks, okay. And then and the last day or so, that's when you get the cough and the pain in the side and you've coughed blood. Okay, all right. Um you said you felt a bit warm. Have you measured your temperature at all? Um with the back of my hand, yes. Yeah, just for hold of that. Okay, fair enough. All right. Um, okay, and now can I just ask, um, do you smoke at all? Uh no. Okay. What do you work as? Um, I work in an office, just a desk job. Okay, all right. And um do you live alone? Uh yes. Yeah. In a flat or a house? Flat. Okay. Do you have any pets? Cat.

So um you're on you're taking Metatraxia at the moment. When was the last time you had Mr. Prixate? Uh this morning. Oh, you had it this morning, okay. Okay. Oh, right. All right. Okay. Um, um, a couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and um get an idea of how unwell you are. Okay. Um, the first thing I'd like to do is to try and measure your pulse. So what the way we're going to do this is that if you're if I can get you to try and locate the pulse on your wrist. Okay. Not everyone can do this, so don't worry if you can't. But if you if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse, it's just under the thumb. If you put your fingers up and down like that, you might be able to feel the pulse. I've got it. You've got it, okay. You sure? Yeah. All right. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting, okay? So I'll just get my stopwatch up. Okay, so if you can um you've still got the pulse? Yeah. Okay. So if you can start counting now, please. One, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, ten, seven. If you can stop now, so that I think that was about eleven or twelve. Um, so that would make your heart rate about 66 to 74. That's that's okay, good. Fantastic. And the next thing I'd like you to try and do, okay. Um, it depends on the lighting, so it may not be possible, but the next thing I'd like to try and do is just to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger, and then let me see how quickly the redness comes back. Okay, so if you can see what I'm doing now, my fingers come up right behind the screen. I'm squeezing it, okay. Just watch me first. It's all right just watch me first. Yeah, I'm I'm squeezing it, and then you can see that it goes pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour. Okay, so if I can get you just to put your finger up to the your camera, and then with the other hand, just try and squeeze it and you've got very good circulation. Okay, perfect. That's great. Thank you so much. The last thing I'd like to do is I'd like to have try and have a look down your throat. Okay. Are are you doing this consultation via um a phone or a laptop? Phone. A phone. So sorry, say that again? I've got a rest of my laptop. Okay, okay. So if you if you um position your device up above your head, put your head back, mouth open wide, and let me see if I can have a that's fantastic to say ah perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent. Lovely. Okay. Last thing is if I can get you to feel inside your neck, just on the sides here, okay, uh, by your Adam's apple, tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not. No, I feel pretty normal to me. Okay. Okay. All right. Um, um uh I sorry, I've forgotten your name. Um Doris. Doris, okay, Doris. Um, so so Doris, um, what what I think we need to do is um this sounds like you might have a chest infection, okay. If you're coughing up blood and you're feeling your heart racing, um uh I think you need to be examined today. Someone needs to listen to your chest and um maybe check your blood pressure as well and check that you're stable. I have to say, examining you now from what limited examination I could do online, your everything does seem to be okay in terms of you you don't seem acutely unstable. However, if you've got this kind of pain um when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood, would you do we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a pneumonia or chest infection, and um that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope, and you may need um an antibiotic. This is one thing I need to ask you. Have you been on any long haul flight recently? No, no. Okay. Have you ever had any clots in your legs or clots in your lungs? Blood clots. Not that I know of, no. No, okay. Anyone in the family have that? No. No. Okay. All right. Um, what I think we'll do is um we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today. Okay. Um, I would like someone to listen to your chest and to check your blood pressure and to recheck your pulse as well. Just make sure and check your temperature, make sure all those parameters are okay. You may well need an antibiotic, okay. Um, do you have any allergies to any antibiotics? No. No, okay. Um, I I'm not I'm gonna not I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now because I think you need to have that basic assessment first um before we proceed to the next step. But that's what I would predict the next step might be. Um, I'm going to leave a number in the notes for this appointment for you to ring our support team, and then they will book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs today, and then they'll do that assessment and then we'll take it from there, okay? But we don't think I'm dying of lung cancer. Um, given the the way in which you uh have presented now, just one day with the fever and this slight pain uh concurrent with the the blood and the the phlegm, that's not usually how lung cancers present. It's more insidious over a longer period of time with other symptoms. Um, however, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding when we see you. Okay. All right. Are you are you worried about lung cancer? Well, you know, you start coughing up blood and you think you're gonna die of lung cancer. So of course, yeah. So just remind me how old you are again I'm sorry. Forty-five. Forty-five okay it's something we do need to be cognizant of okay um and we may end up having to do a follow-up chest x-ray if things don't settle down. But at the moment it it seems more like a chest infection rather than a lung cancer. That's good to know. Yeah that that is good to know yes because that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are okay because chest infections can become nasty as well and can lead to infection inside the body and we want to avoid that as well. So let's get you checked out today and hopefully we can put your mind to rest and get you on the right course of treatment. Perfect thank you very much. Alright you're welcome all right take care then all the best bye.
