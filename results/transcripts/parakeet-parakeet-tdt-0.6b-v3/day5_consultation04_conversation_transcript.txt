Um so what we can do is we can arrange a face-to-face examination where they can um see you in a clinic and do an abdominal examination and advise further from them when we've got more of an idea what's causing the problem. Um would you be happy to call the support line and arrange that appointment? Yes. Okay, that's fine. So we'll we'll do that. In the meantime, if it gets a lot worse or you you're not holding any fluids down, um we should see you before then. Um did you say your pregnancy test was a month ago? Yes. Okay. Um your implant on was just put in a year ago. Yes. The other thing we would need to do is to to do a pregnancy test today if possible. I would do it. So if you can do that today, and if it's positive, we need to see you straight away so it gives a call back. Yes. Okay. Have you got any other questions? No one. No, I'm that's it. Right, okay.
