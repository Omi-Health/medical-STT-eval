I've been a bit slower, and you know it's uh it's it's a bit of a stressful period just around the um end of the year. All right. Okay. Is that affecting your um your mood at all in the in any way?

Um, yeah, occasionally, no, cigars and things on company parties. Okay, so not not regular. Um, and what about alcohol? Um, occasionally I would have some. I'm not a very big drinker. Again, socially would work. Um, so um sir, just having listened to your story. Um really just to summarize, you know, it's the last four days you've been feeling journey quite unwell, sore throat, runny nose, a bit of a dry cough, bit of muscle pain, weakness, um, had an initial fever but now settled. Um I don't think there's a lot to worry about. I think you probably have you know a bit of a viral, what we say viral illness, and maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection or maybe uh early signs of a flu. Um these normally lasts for about seven to ten days and just gets better really um over time. But things you can do to really help yourself um is get plenty of rest. I'll probably advise you taking a day or two of work if you can. Um making yourself, you know, pushing fluids and make yourself well hydrated, continuing with the regular parasitical and ibuprofen, um, and and we should see how things go really. Um if next week you're still not better, I'd like you to come back and see me. Um is that clear? Is that does that make does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, that's that's that's all good. It makes sense. Uh I think I thought I'll take uh a couple of days off. Yeah. And uh see how it goes. And things to look out for if you're really not getting better, if you if you have a high fever or your breathing is becoming a bit more laboured or chest pain, I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner. Give me a call. Um and we we can help you out, okay? Yeah, yeah, understood. All right, I'll uh I'll take care. Great. Have a great day. Good luck with your work. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
