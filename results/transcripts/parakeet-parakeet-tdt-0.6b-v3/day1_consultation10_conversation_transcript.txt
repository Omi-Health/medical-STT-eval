Next door. Hello. Hello. Hi. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, I can hear you. Hi. Right, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Sure. Um, I'm Manda Jackson and I'm 19 years old. 19 years old, okay. Amanda, and how can I help you this afternoon? Um, so it's been going on for a few days now. Um, it's not happened before, and I'm a bit worried. I it's kind of hurts when I kind of pee. Um, and yeah, it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more. Um, and it's really like I can't like go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. Um, and it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in at the bottom of my tummy as well. Right, okay. I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you. Um so you mentioned it's been going on for the last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. Um you said you're going to the toilet more often as well. Is that right? Uh yeah, it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days, I think actually. Maybe just under a week. Oh, under week, sorry. Um sorry, no, I I didn't explain it properly before. Um, yeah, no, I it's been going on for about just under a week. Um, and yeah, I do notice sort of burning, stinging when I when I go to the toilet. Yeah. Have you noticed any any anything in your urine, for example, any blood or um discoloration of urine? Um, I think well, today I noticed um that it was like a bit pink, the the urine. Okay. Yeah. I think just today. Have you noticed any of any kind of frank blood? I mean red blood at all in your urine. Um I think it was picked in, probably. I don't know, it was pink, so okay. Um fine. Well we'll definitely definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on. Um you also mentioned some tummy pain as well. Can you tell me a bit more about that pain? Yeah, it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy. Um, mainly when I go to the loo. I think that's when it's worse. Okay. Um can you describe it as a crampy pain? Is it more of a burning pain? Um I wouldn't describe it as crampy. I don't think it's like a period pain. It's a bit different. It's it's hard to say, an achy pain, I suppose. Ache pain, okay. And does a pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back, towards your sides? Um no, no. Okay, all right. Um any other symptoms at all? Like, for example, nausea, vomiting. No, no nausea vomiting. Okay, any temperatures or fevers? Um, no, no, not that I've noticed. Okay, all right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working okay? Uh I I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway. So I don't think it's any different than what it usually is. When we say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have? Um, I think I have um IBS. Um, so I just kind of pass up my bowels like quite quite a lot. Um and sometimes it's quite it's quite variable, like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, it's sorry, this is a bit disgusting, but like sometimes it's a bit um harder and it's kind of hard to predict. Okay, all right. But you've noticed no new issues. No no no new symptoms in your bowels. Um, no, not that I'm gonna do it. All right. Um and Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions, as you can imagine. Um uh can I ask, are you currently uh are you currently sexually active at the moment? Uh uh yeah. Um I have uh uh a long-term um boyfriend okay and um have you noticed any other discharge from down below so from from the fun passage um not no I don't think so nothing unusual okay have you do you use any form of contraception uh yeah uh I'm um on the pill the pill what kind of pill is it a combined pill or the mini pill uh combined pill okay fine um when was the last time you had um unprotected sex if you don't want me ask um uh I mean I mean unprotected is in like no no condoms or anything yeah exactly um I I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend just like I don't know we've just kind of agreed uh so um I guess a week ago two weeks ago something okay all right quite quite I guess what I'm trying to get at is whether um uh there's any chance you could be pregnant at all uh I know you're on the pill but um we we nonetheless we do have to ask um when was your last when was your last period um two weeks ago two weeks ago okay all right just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better okay um fine in terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you uh eating and drinking okay uh yeah yeah eating drinking okay um I did have one kind of concern I don't know so I smoked uh this is quite bad but I smoked weed for the first time uh like a week and a half ago I I just wonder whether it's related at all probably not but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. Sure. Well thanks for sharing with me. Um so uh I I don't think it's is related to your symptoms I think it's probably just pure pure coincidence. Um but uh you know I do strongly advise you to you know um make it a regular habit if you can um just for your just for your general health moving forwards okay um fine moving on in terms of your health otherwise do you have any other medical conditions apart from the IBS is there anything else I should be aware of no okay great and what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the um combined pill apart from the pill um I take um something for the IBS as well um it begins with an M. It's really hard to pronounce like mebe something maybe yeah okay yeah yeah that's it yeah yeah that's right okay and then that's for the cramps the crampy pain yeah yeah and do you have any allergies any medications um yeah I think there was an antibiotic um called Clindus clindamycin okay okay that I took like a couple years ago something and yeah that that didn't go too well right with me okay sure I'll make a note of that um in terms of family history any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys no no problem anything else good and socially tell me a bit more about your home situation who's at home with you um so I am living in Halls at the moment, uh uni. Um, so uh I'm just living with a flatmate, I suppose. Um, but my family uh live kind of outside of London, not too far away. Um so yeah, uh my family are fine and I see them now and then. Very good. Yeah, things I think I think things are okay generally. Great. And what are you studying at university? Um studying uh English. English, okay, good. And how are you enjoying your course? Yeah, yeah, it's it's going well. Thanks. Just kind of started uh a few months ago, a few months ago. Yeah, I really enjoy it. Yeah, yeah. Very good. Good. Um in terms of smoking and alcohol, do you do you participate in either? Uh as I admitted before, I tried weed for the first time, uh, but I don't smoke. Uh I drink occasionally, um kind of socially. Um with friends after what made you have your first joint last week? Um I d I was just a party. Um there were some other people doing it. Um I kind of was a little bit tipsy, so probably wasn't thinking quite straight. Um, but yeah, I I completely agree. It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure. And obviously your doctor tells me I take off to you, so uh I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid it. Great. Um fine. So uh at this is I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think um, you know, I I'm reassured by the fact I I I think it's um probably just a simple what we say, uh UTI or uh cystitis, bladder infection. Um you know, you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about. So things like fevers and back pain um would be more worrying for me to hear. Um, so some of these we we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. Um, so we've got a choice of two antibiotics, something called trimethoprin or nitroferentoin, which is a three-day course. Normally they're usually quite effective for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well, if you can, so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there. Um start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids. Um if you are having some pain, simple paracetamol um would probably be advisable. Um we'll see what the urine sample shows. Um, and if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. Um, but if things are still not getting any better next week, come back and see me and we can have another look again. Okay, okay, uh great. Um with with the urine sample, um, how do I go about doing that? So uh well good question. So I will give you I will organize uh for you to come in and drop off a sample, uh one of our practices, um, which we can test there and then with a urine dip and then send off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results. Okay, perfect. Okay, great. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call, okay. Fever, back pain, vomiting, great, okay. Yeah, I'll okay. Have a good day. Okay. Great. Thank you. You two have it. Bye bye.
