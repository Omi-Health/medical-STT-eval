Um 2112 and 1986. And your address for me, please. It is uh number one London Street. Um NW36PQ. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. We are, yes. Okay. So I understand you're having a headache. Is that correct? Uh yeah, I've had a um a sort of a fairly sort of bad severe headache for the past four days. Um I've been sort of feeling a bit hot as well. Um I've got got a bit of a temperature, I think. I haven't measured it, but um I think I've yeah, I think I've got fever. Okay, right. And um so what started for us? Was it the headache or the fever? Um so um headache started uh first, um, and then sort of yeah, fever sort of came along a bit afterwards. Okay, afterwards. Right. And what have you taken so far for your headache? Um so I've had some paracetamol and some ibuprofen, but it's not really helping at the moment. Okay, so just a few more questions with regards to your headache. So do you find it difficult to look at the light? Um no, my uh my like um it's fine, light doesn't seem to bother me too much. Okay, uh and is it any pain when you try to move your neck from side to side up and down? Is there any pain? Um I've got sort of general aching muscles, um, not necessarily sort of in my neck, it's kind of a bit all over really. Okay, all over. Right. And have you been sick with this head headache? No, no, I haven't I haven't been sick. Okay. And do you have a cough? Uh no, no cough. Okay, so there's no cough or cold, yeah? Uh no, no. Okay, and you your ears are okay, there's no earaches? Um no, it it seems to be okay. That's that's fine. Okay, all right. And with this headache, have you experienced any pins and needles in your face, arms and legs? Uh no. No. Any muscle weaknesses at all? Um, just uh I suppose general aching, body aching. Not not any weakness, but where you couldn't, you know, hold a cup or anything like that. That's what I mean. Uh no, um I'm sort of yeah, I'm seem to be sort of fine with that sort of stuff, but yeah. Okay. And um just a few more questions. Do you because I don't have any of your background history? Um, do you suffer from any medical conditions? Uh no, um general medical history is fine. Fine. And no surgical history that in no medical or surgical complaints, yeah? Uh no. Um I I suppose uh I have been away to um uh Thailand um uh week or so ago. Um I've had some like uh usual mosquito bites from sort of travelling around and uh it's a friend of mine has also been a bit unwell, but um uh yeah, that's the only sort of like history per se. Right, and um do you have any kind of shivering at all? Do you're shivering with the fever? Um I um uh I I do feel cold quite a lot. Um, you know, it's um no sort of shivering, but definitely like a bit cold. Hot and cold, yeah. Yeah. Okay, right. And are you using yeah, you've mentioned about the paracetamol algorithm now, but are you on any red regular any medication, anything that you're using at all? Uh no. Okay. Um any allergies at all? Uh no. Um right. Okay. And okay, so uh I I believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you. Yeah. Uh it it's not of possible for us to do that online. I think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination, and uh I think you would need one quite urgently. Okay, so the things that's got running in the back of my mind are um kind of uh viral illnesses that can one can get with um sort of mosquito bikes or foreign travel like area. Um the the other common thing around Thailand it will be like some dengu, but that would have like you would have some uh blood spots or bleeding or something, but you don't have at the moment, do you? Uh no, I've I mean I've got a bit of a rash, but nothing like uh no no no no bleeding. Okay. So where's the rash? Um it's uh rash is kind of all all all over my body. Like how would it not really localized? How would you describe the brush? Um uh sort of red and itchy. Red and itchy. Yeah. Okay. So if you were to put a glass on top of the rash, does that rash go away? Uh yes. It goes away. Okay. Okay. So what we need to do is we need to urgently examine you, and that's sometime today. Okay. And um after our examination, there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital, but I'm not sure as yet. So I'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible. Okay. So I'll write night notes in and recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor, preferably in the next few hours' time. Okay. And um, in any case, if that's not available, I'd like you to take yourself to AE. Okay. All right, any questions at all? Uh no, sound serious. It's you know, obviously, when I've spoken to you, you you didn't take the box for many theories, but you're in the middle somewhere, let's put it that way. Okay. Um, if if you you know things like we have to rule out is meningitis and all, but then you just have a general muscle ache. You didn't say that you had things like you had problems looking at light or something. So those are things when we think of meningitis, but and then it's the uh in meningitis, you get a non-blanching rash while in any kind of virus it you know, the rash usually goes away. Saying that we don't know whether these are the beginning stages, so that's why I'd rather, but I would rather you see a G GP as soon as possible if uh we've got a slot available, but if not, I think you need to be seen and maybe have some blood tests and examinations. Okay. Okay, cool. Thank you very much. All right. You take care then. Bye now. Cheers. Bye.
