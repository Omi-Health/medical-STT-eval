Hello. Hello? Hi, hi. Hi, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you well. Hi, my name's Dr. Gohill. I'm one of the doctors that works at Babylon. Can I doctor? Can I check your name and date of birth, please? Yes, my my name is uh Roberto Mendoza. Okay. I'm I was born on the 1st of January of um uh 1992. Okay, and are you in a space that's quiet and you're able to talk? Oh sorry, I um over 1990 sorry, I'm 48. Sorry, I forgot the perfect. So you're 48. And are you able to talk at the moment? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Tell me, uh it says here you have a your uh you're having problems going to the toilet. Yes, so I have a I have a I don't know how to say it properly in English. Uh I mean with something vulgar, like diarrhea. Okay, so it's lasting for like three days. And uh yeah, I I don't know. Uh I don't know what would cause it. Uh um uh I have a bit of uh pain, nominal pain, and I had a bit of vomiting. And uh yeah, but this is kind of like the what is happening to me. Okay. Tell me how you were three days ago before this started. Did you have any medical problems? Uh so I have I have I have a asthma and I take some uh some um inhaler. Okay. I don't know, uh I take an inhaler, um and um uh I have an allergy. I have an NP NKDA allergy. Okay. So I don't know if it's because I don't know. Yeah. And apart from asthma, do you have anything else? I don't know. Maybe it's well because you know it's this thing here in the stomach stuff. I I always have in the back of my head my father because he died about 10 years ago of bulb cancer. Okay. So yeah, this is kind of the my my worries. I don't know. Okay. So you've um you've had the diarrhoea for three days and now you're having pain and vomiting? Yes. Yes. Has the diarrhea been getting better or worse? Uh uh I I think it's not getting better or worse. It's kind of like uh uh like eatle like normal. Okay, like uh it it it hasn't gone away, it hasn't worsened. Okay, and how often do you go to the toilet? I go I need to go, I I can't go to work because I need to go like every I don't know, is this feeling like I go to the toilet and then when I finish I need to I feel I need to go again? Okay, and and uh and yeah, so I need to be like close to the toilet. Uh that must be that must be hard. Yeah, yeah. Have you had to drink more water than normal? Uh I don't know. Maybe I'm not drinking enough water. Yeah, I drink uh I think I yeah, I don't know. I I think I don't drink enough water. An important question: have you noticed any blood? Uh no, I haven't noticed any any blood. And you mentioned tummy pain. Can you tell me more about your tummy pain? Like where it is and if it goes anywhere. So the pain is mainly uh focus in in the center area of the abdomen, like under the belly, under the belly button. Yeah. And uh yeah, and sometimes I can hear my stomach uh like uh the crumbs. Yeah. You've been able to eat and drink. Uh yes, but yes, but I I go to the toilet all so often, so I I I yeah, I try not to eat a lot because I yeah, I just went to the toilet every 10 minutes. And you said the tummy pain's in the middle of your tummy. Does it go anywhere else? No, no, just there. And it it seems to be alleviated a bit toilet, and maybe it's like trap gas, I don't know what it is, but okay. And when was the last time you vomited? I think it was this morning. This morning. I but the thing is like because I'm not eating anything now, so I I haven't vomited again. Did you have any breakfast? I don't know. I didn't uh no, sorry, yes, I did actually. I did. Hold on. I had some fruit. I had some fruit. Okay. And that and you vomited that uh afterwards? And afterwards I didn't have anything, then I got a bit of nausea and I vomited, and then uh yeah, and that was it. And that was it. And I haven't eaten since then. So now I'm I I think I'm okay, but uh yeah, and I don't yeah. Did you notice any blood when you vomit? I think I do. I think I do, but this uh uh no no actually I can't say sorry, I'm sorry. I I I don't think there is blood because uh yeah, it was it was a strawberries that I was having for breakfast, so yeah, it wasn't blood. Okay, and um yeah, did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain? Uh I I don't know. To be honest, sometimes I have when I get a bit of anxiety, I I use my inhaler. Yeah, and but my inhaler kind of um ran out the one because you know I'm a foreigner, so I have uh this brand, but I bought the new one here. Okay, and uh I don't know maybe this new one has caused it this problem. I don't know. Okay, it's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this. Normally it's when you eat um bad food or food that has gone off. Uh-huh. And you normally get symptoms like you have suggested. But just to double check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing? Uh uh I I always have problems with my breathing because of the asthma. Like when I actually I need to use my inhaler a little bit, but apart from the normal, I haven't I haven't. Okay, and how about chest? Have you noticed any chest pain? No, I haven't I haven't noticed any chest pain. Okay, and how about um walking and talking? Are those all both okay? Uh walking and talking uh yes, yes. Uh I uh but uh but yeah, I don't walk very far because uh I yeah, I need to I need to go to the toilet now and then, so I'm spending some time at home. And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain? Oh it does a little bit. Okay. Sorry, I was just writing some things down. Sure. So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain. Okay, and it's normal. This is normally called gastroenteritis, so an infection of the tummy. Oh, okay. Normally, when patients have this, we always do three things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because you're losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers. So if you start getting a temperature, then you need three is stay home for the time being until you get slightly better. Okay, and normally I yeah, normally things like antibiotics don't help, they make the situation worse. Okay. So that's I didn't go ahead. Sorry, I think. No, I was saying I didn't have any fever recently. I I was sweating a little bit last for bed, but I I'm not sure if if I had a bit of fever, but very little, or but I don't think so. I don't think. I don't know, maybe. So I think that's what we should do for the time being. If you feel you're getting much worse, then I would suggest you go and see or GP in real in real life in person, so they can look at your belly. Okay, I will yeah, I will book then. I will be booked to I will wait a couple of days to see, or one more day, and then I will book. Great. Cool do you have any more questions for me? Uh no that's uh that's it. I was maybe just concerned about my father's uh medical history if that would uh yeah could add some kind of risk. So the the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had. But if your things don't get worse then that's something that we can look at from the GP. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah that sounds good that sounds good. Thank you very much. Thank you very much doctor for your time. Bye bye bye bye
