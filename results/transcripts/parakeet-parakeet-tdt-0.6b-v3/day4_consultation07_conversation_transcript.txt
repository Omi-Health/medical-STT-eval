Hello, can you hear me okay? Hey, yes, I can. Can you hear me? Yeah, good, good. So my name is Joe. I'm a doctor here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? Hey, my name's Vincent. And your date of birth. 9th of May 2016. Okay, great. Sorry. And are you in a uh a safe place? Oh sorry, a safe and conf confidential place to talk and just happy to go ahead with a consultation. Yes, yes I am. Great. So how can I help? Yeah, so I have a call that I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week, and it's been causing me problems. I've had to stay away from work for about three or four of those days because of our bad. Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week. And what came what came first? Uh the sore throat came first and then after a day or two the cough. Okay, okay. And uh are you quoughing up anything? No, it's very dry. Okay. So I'm just gonna ask a few questions about the uh your current symptoms and then a little bit about your background um and something else about what we can do uh a little bit later on in the consultation to help you. But before we go on, anything you're particularly concerned about or have any ideas what might be going on? You said that you had a cold. Well well, I mean you know you know how we all are. Once this happens, you Google it, and there seems to be all kinds of bad things. Could be, it could be could be a cold or obviously because it's tuberculosis, it could be cancer, always comes up. So it'll be good if none of those. Right. So yeah, I can provide a little bit of reassurance. Um and uh we can talk about those a little bit as well. And was there anything you're particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation? Um well uh yeah, so reassurance, so like hopefully some sense that's not anything too serious, but also if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better or any advice, or maybe even a sick note, so that if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer, I can get one. Sure, sure. Okay. All right. So we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms, and I'm sure we can give get a um those things, uh sick and some reassurance. Um about your concerns. So um you mentioned that you started with the sore throat about a week ago, developed into a bit of a dry cough. Um I'll just ask a few questions around those. So um, do you have any shortness of breath? Yes, yes, I've been having shortness of breath. Oh yeah, I've been having shortness of breath, yeah. You are short of breath. And uh do you have any wheeze or chest pain? Yeah, a bit of a you're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well. Yes. Okay. And how uh when did you start to develop the shortness of breath? Let's see. So the sore throat, so today is Friday, so throat was about last week, Friday or Thursday. Cough was Saturday or Sunday. So the so the shortness of breath was I think shortly after the cough, so maybe a day or two later, so three, four days ago. Three or four days ago that you started developing prescription. And is the cough worse at night time? No, no, it's the same throughout the weekday. Same throughout the day. Um, and uh when you say you're short of breath, just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are. So are you able to um so like walk up a flight of stairs, for example? Um, or or are you short of breath at rest? Uh yeah, it's it's like when I'm doing walking, um, and I do exercise now and then, so it hasn't been super bad, like hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual and a little bit worried. And you're a bit concerned about that, okay. So I just need to ask a few uh things about your background as well. So um, do you have any other medical conditions or medical history? No, just no, no parts medical history, no. No post medical, no history of asthma. No. Um, and any uh uh history of uh clots on your legs or your lungs? So these are DVTs or P's. Uh no one in your family's had those clots in the legs or lungs? Well, my mother had lung cancer. Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke? No. Have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos? You know, don't know if asbestos ever smokes. I mean, once or twice in Amsterdam, exactly, but not really. Okay. Um, and uh this just going back to the your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough, it's a dry cough, no, you're not coughing up any phlegm. Um, do you do you have uh and you don't you say you don't have any chest pain as such? Um uh are you taking any medications currently at the moment? Uh no, I'm not okay. Are you allergic to any medications? Not to any medication, but I'm allergic to peanuts. Peanuts, okay. Um and uh you mentioned that your mother had uh lung cancer. Um any other family history of any significant illnesses uh when running in your family? No, no, that's the only one, just lung cancer from my mother. Just lung cancer. Okay. And you say you have a cold, so do you have sinus congestion or um no? It seems to be all entirely with just my throat, like my nose is turning up. So just your just your throat and any recent travel or have you always lived in the UK? Uh no, so I I haven't always lived in the UK. Like so I was born in the US and moved over about 12 years ago, but in terms of recent travel just to Europe, nowhere to exotic. Okay, so no so no recent travel, no significant recent travel any anywhere. Um okay. And are you coughing up anything other than um so you you're not coughing up blood or anything like that? No, no. Um good. And uh are you feeling feverish, hot, cold, sweaty? Yeah, so a little bit feverish uh um at first, so the first three or so days of this, but then it's the fever's gone away. Okay. And in general, do you have a sorry? Yeah. Yeah, I was just gonna say also had a bit of a headache. Uh like medics are common go either, but like right now, it's fine. Okay. And in general, would you say you're feeling you're you're beginning to to feel better, worse, or or sort of um staying the same? It's so it's like it's up and down. So let's see. So I it started last week and I stayed home from work two days this week. I think it was maybe Tuesday and then Thursday, so like I felt better and then worse again and then better and then worse again. So it's been like kind of constant but constant in the variable that makes sense. Okay. And I just need to ask any other sort of risk factors um that you may have. So um no sort of significant weight loss um or unexplained weight loss. Any waters? So no weight loss, but I have been have been losing my appetite recently. And I mean I usually eat a lot, so I don't enjoy eating as well, but like that's been a bit concerning. You've been losing your appetite recently. Yes. And you're a little bit concerned about that. But you haven't you haven't lost any weight that you think of. No, not that. And any um sort of rashes or anything? Uh and you no, no rash. Okay. Um so I would ask to examine you now, but um I I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat at least to see if there's a probably I might think about doing that. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck that you can feel? Uh no. Not the no, okay. Um and so finally you you were talking about uh I mean it sounds to me that um you've been a little bit up and down, sore throat, developed a dry cough. Um you are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say we're just coming to the end of the consultation now is if you feel significantly worse, um uh if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness or breathlessness that you are concerned about, then I would advise you to seek medical attention again, see a GP and actually see somebody physically. Um but I think for now I can sort of uh try and reassure you that um if this clears up as I expect it would, so expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days. Um if it's not please get in touch with the medical professional again. Um and uh I would expect it to, and so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis. Um your concerns about lung cancer are was that the other thing you're concerned about? Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, so so um again, if you're not getting better, please see somebody again. Um I've just got four seconds now, so nice talking to you. And have we got a we gotta tidy up? Yeah, okay, so um uh and I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days off work, um, and paracetamol, lots of fluids, um, and uh rest up. And as I say, if you're not feeling better, please get in touch. Okay. All right, thanks a lot. Have a good day. Thank you. Right.
