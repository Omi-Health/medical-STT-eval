Hi. Hi, hello, I'm Dr. Jacob. Welcome to Babylon. Hello. Hi. Hi. So just before we start, is it alright if you could confirm your name for me, please? And your date of birth? The 14th of July 1996. And your address for me, please. And 28 Quicks Road SW191EZ. That's correct. And just to conclude that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Thank you. Okay. So you mentioned in in our notes that you've got some tightness. If you could like to tell me a bit more about it, please. Yeah, so about two to three days ago I was running with a friend, and usually I could talk to her whilst I ran, but I found myself actually short of breath. I'm not really short of breath when I'm walking. But definitely if I'm walking briskly now. And I've used my blue inhaler, but to no avail. That hasn't really helped me. Okay. So yeah. So I'm having I'm just wheezing a bit and coughing and just generally a bit short of breath. Wheezing and coughing, okay. And you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler. So how often are you using the blue inhaler? Um I think I'm just using that as and when I have symptoms. Yeah. So at the moment you are having shortness of breath. So are you using it every day at the moment? Um yeah, and morning and evening to kind of prevent it as well. Okay, and um what which colour? What's the name of your preventer? Um it's a blue. Um I think in totality um my history of salbutamol, clenol, cetraband and hydrocortisone that I'm taking as well. Okay, so could you repeat that? Your salbutamol, clenol? Uh cetra ben and hydrocortisone. And hydrocortisone. So you have eczema also, yeah. So what's that? Sorry. You do have a history of eczema then. Um my brother's asthmatic and my sister has eczema um and I've got a few issues that I think could be eczema as well. Okay, right. So coming back to your um, you know, your shortness of breath, you've mentioned your wheezy and your coughing. Are you bringing up any phlegm at all? Um no, I don't um I'm not covering up much butum. Okay, no spiritual, okay. Right, tio. And um how are you using your um your clenol? So are you using it every day? Um I think I'm using that every day, and the style butamol is just like as and when. So, how are you using the clenol? Is it twice a day? Um, yes. Twice. Okay. And have you ever been admitted in hospital because your asthma was so bad? Um, no, I haven't. Okay. Right, tier. When was the last time you had an asthma attack? Um, about three to four years ago. Three to four years ago. And what what did the DP do at that time? Um, just um encouraged me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative. Okay, so you didn't have any stero steroids or antibiotics? Not that I can remember. Okay. Um have you ever had oral steroids in the past? Um, no. When was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse? Um, about two years ago. Okay, two years ago. Okay, but your asthma was pretty under control till till now, isn't it? Uh yes, just in the last two times. So, do you do a peak flow meter at home? Peak flow reading where you blow into you know, do you do that now? Um just every now and then. I haven't done it over the last since I've had symptoms. Okay, so what was what's your peak flow reading then your good? Like normal peak flow reading. Um I think 100 30. Okay, let's say it's about um 380. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, right. So that's your normal, yeah? Right here. Okay, so what we need. Okay, do you have any allergies at all? Um, I have hay fever. Sorry, could you repeat that please? Sorry, I have hay fever. Hey, okay, no, no, any med allergies to medication. Oh no, sorry. Okay, so you're not allergic to anything. Okay, so no allergies. Okay, excellent. Right here. So, what we need to do that, obviously, we eat you haven't had an asthma check for some time, and it looks like you can be having a small small exacerbation. So, what I would like you to be seen by one of our GPs in the next few days. In the interim, what I'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when you use it maximum about every two to four four hours. But if you're using it that often, that means pretty much that you know your asthma is really bad. You can use it, but that's not ideal. The blue uh the browning, your clenal, the brown inhaler, you can up the dose. If you're using just two puffs twice a day, you can increase it to four puffs twice a day. Yeah. And while this is to do while you're waiting to see us. Now, mentioned, you know, you're doing what you know, increase the uh clenal to four puffs twice a day, and you're using the asthma, you know, the blue inhalers every two to four hours, and your breathing's getting really worse, then you wouldn't need to take yourself to AE. You shouldn't wait for our appointment. Okay, so when your doctor sees you, what we're going to do is we're gonna examine your chest, yeah. Make you do the peak that we're reading. So, depending on what we find, you might need some antibiotics or some steroids. But anyway, while you're at home, we are going to by increasing your clenal, we are increasing your steroid intake anyway. Okay, so yeah, so any questions you wanted to ask me. Am I yeah, so book an appointment, call support, book an appointment to see, and I will recommend that you do the face-to-face. In the interim, increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day, and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly. But if your breathing's getting worse and you've not seen us, do take yourself to A. All right. Okay, okay. Thank you so much for your time. You're welcome. Take care then. Bye bye now. Bye. Bye.
