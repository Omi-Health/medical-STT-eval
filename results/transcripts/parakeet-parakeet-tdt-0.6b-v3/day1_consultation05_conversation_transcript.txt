Hello. Good morning, Kim. How can I help you this morning? Um, so I'm some some pain uh in my tummy, like the lower part of my tummy. Okay. Um and I'm just becoming quite hot and sweaty. Right. I'm sorry to hear that. When when did your symptoms all start? About two days ago. Okay. And whereabouts in your tummy is the pain exactly. Uh like below my belly button. It's like quite sore when I press on it. Okay. Did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual? So it uh it hasn't been, it's more gradual and it's just it's getting a bit worse now. Okay, okay. And can you describe the pain to me? Uh it's kind of like a I guess a burning pain. Uh and it's just right there in that spot. Like it that's mostly where I'm feeling it. It hasn't spread anywhere else. Justin, just below your belly button, you weren't mentioned. Yeah. Okay. Um and is the pain constant or does it come and go? It's pretty constant. It's like getting worse. Um it's not like I I can still move and walk around. Uh I mean, I'm still kind of functioning. It's just uh I'm aware of it the whole time. Okay. Um and with the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms at all? So for example, let's let's focus first on your bowels. Are your bowels working okay? Yeah, I had a bit of constipation, but that's better now, that was like since last week. Okay, so you've got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose tools? No. I'm I'm my bowel movements are normal now. Okay. And what about your water works? Are you passing urine okay? Yeah, I'm fine. That's fine. That's I did notice that I was a little the urine was a little pink in colour, but I haven't like it hasn't really been burning specifically or hurting when I pee. And uh and I did notice I was going to the I was peeing more regularly, but I have been drinking lots of fluids, so I wasn't sure. Um I wasn't sure um like you know if that was related to the pain. Okay, when you mentioned pink urine, do you was there any blood at all in your urine or is it difficult to say? I can't say. I mean maybe. Okay, all right, but otherwise it doesn't hurt uh or or of sting when you pass urine. I I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that. Um just that I'm peeing more than off more regularly. Okay. Um uh moving up towards uh uh other symptoms. Have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all? Just a little nauseous, um, but no vomiting. No vomiting. Any temperatures of fevers? I haven't really I felt a bit hot and sweaty, but I haven't really measured it, so I can't really say. Okay, fine. Um and Kim, do you have to ask um uh you know all or all female patients? It's just questions about your cycles, if you don't mind me asking. Um are you currently um are you currently sexually active? Uh yeah, I've I've had the same partner. I am we were last sexually active about four days ago. Um my last STD screen was normal, which was about six months ago. Okay, so you've had no other partners since then? No other population since then. Okay. Um and do you use any contraception at all? Um on the implanar. I had the implant on inserted about a year ago. Implement. Okay, fine. Um are you still having periods? Yes. When was your last period? Uh my last period was about three weeks ago. I mean two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, okay. So is it any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implement in, but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? It's something for us to think about potentially. Well we don't use any other barrier methods, so we just use the I just have the implanar and the same partner. Um theoretically, if the implanton hasn't been working, then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect. Okay. Well something for us to think about um uh maybe worth doing a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that. Um okay, and and so just to summarize so far, if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple of days is tummy pain has really affected you, mainly lower down towards your belly button, it's quite burning. You said it's getting worse. Um you noticed some pink urine, um, but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine, your bowels are working okay. You felt a little bit nauseous um and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right? Yeah, that sounds very accurate. Is there anything else perhaps uh you feel like you should share with me at this stage, which you think might be important? I don't think so. I think you've come we've covered everything that's really bothering me. Yeah, okay. Um tell me tell me a bit more about your um medical history otherwise. Are you normally fitting well? Yeah, quite well. I haven't had any surgical, I don't have any surgical history. I don't have any previous I haven't had any operations before or and I'm not on any other medication. I just had the implant. Okay. Um in the past, any similar symptoms? I've never had I've never had these symptoms before. No, okay. Um fine. Um any other family history I should be aware of? Anything relevant family uh related to bowels, maybe related to gynee history? No, not that not that I'm aware of that. Okay, all right. Um and socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? Uh I live in a share house and with two other two other roommates. Okay, um and uh are you currently working? Yeah, I currently I am currently working. What do you do for work? I am an accountant. Okay. Um do you smoke at all, Tim? No. No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Uh socially I drink, but uh I don't think more than normal. No, okay. Okay. Um just before I go to examination, I just want to go through just some few screening questions, that's okay, yes or no. Uh we've we've covered the majority of them already, um, but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else. Um, how's your how how's your chest? How's your breathing? Um I don't feel short of breath or or I'm not having any problems, or I don't have a cough or anything that's worried me. Okay, any uh funny heartbeats or rhythms, palpitations? Not that no. Okay. Any headaches, any problems with your vision? No. No, okay, alright. Um fine, okay. Um, so really just um moving on. Um, so based based on your story, really, uh uh Kim, it's it's a it's a difficult one. It's it's it's um we know you've got some primary pain, we don't exactly know what's causing it. It could be a few different things that could be causing your pain. Could just be uh, you know, it could just be a urine infection, for example, could this be something related to your gut? Um could this be something related to your you know a pregnancy related cause? Um, and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out um what's going on here. Um which I can organize for you today. Okay. Um and based on those tests we we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed. But certainly if if if it's been going on for the last couple of days, um uh uh, you know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for a maybe a urine infection, and so with some anticipation. Yeah, I think can we do that instead of me going for tests and then seeing how that goes? Yeah, absolutely. So um I think it's certainly worth you know covering you with some antibiotics today. Uh, but I still want you to bear in mind, you know, uh having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here, and um and I want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days' time if your symptoms are not getting any better, or indeed if they're getting worse. So things to look out for would be you know, worsening tummy pain, um, if you're feeling really hot or sweaty, the temperature's not coming down, um, vomiting, etc. Does that make sense? Yeah, I think I'm happy with that plant. Okay. Um, you can try just regular painkillers, uh, paracetamol uh will be advisable. Um make sure you drink plenty of fluids. You can try some cranberry juice as well, which uh can sometimes help with your urine symptoms. Um take the antibiotics uh and give me a call if you know if you are worried about anything else. Uh sure, that sounds great. Thank you very much. Um, should I just collect the script at my pharmacy? Yeah, but I'll send it straight to your pharmacy. Start the antibiotics today, something called trimethoprin. Um take two tablets, uh one tablet twice a day for three days. Okay, that sounds great. Let's say you get on. Okay, thank you very much. Great, all the best. Bye.
