All right, Laura. Well, how can I help you this afternoon? Uh yeah, so I have uh soreness in my fingers and my finger, like the skin on my hands is kind of cracked. Okay. When when did this all start? Um a couple of months ago, like three, four months ago. Okay, so it's been that long, has it? Yeah. Okay, and so you mentioned your the is it the skin on your hands mainly that's dry. Yeah, I haven't noticed I mean I have dryness like you know, in other parts, like my legs, but it's not it's not very it's not severe. It's just you know, I've always, you know, I don't hydrate very much, so like it's very it's very bad in my hands. Okay. Can I ask why have you come to see me today? Uh is it because it's got worse recently, your symptoms. Yeah, I mean it it's gotten to a point where where it it hurts a lot and I can't really do my job, so I thought I should probably get it checked out. Yeah, that sounds like a very sensible plan. Um which part of your hands are affected mainly? Uh the palm. Yeah. Okay, alright. Um have you noticed any itchiness in your palms? Yeah, it's itchy, not all the time, but yeah, it does get itchy. Okay, any bleeding at all? Uh I don't I mean no, I don't think so. Scratching yourself often and bleeding. Um yeah, I guess when I scratched it, yes, it has bled sometimes, but yeah. Otherwise it it hadn't bled on its own. Okay. Um fine. Uh okay, sorry, I'm just gonna write a notes as we go along. Um and you mentioned the skin is quite correct as well, is that right? Yes, that's right. Okay, alright. Um I know it's a long time ago, but do you remember how it all started? What were you doing at the time when it all started? Is it anything you may have done to bring your symptoms on? Uh I mean I am a I do work as a housekeeper. Um to be honest, I'm not always very good about wearing gloves. Um, so that's good. Um I switched jobs uh four months ago. Um I've been working for as a housekeeper for for a while though, but um that's the only thing I can think of. Yeah, I think that might be quite important actually. I think there's definitely a maybe a correlation between the two. Um fine. And so you mentioned something about having general dryness. Is that you mentioned your legs as well? Yeah. Yeah, but isn't it sorry? Is that something you've you've had for a while now? Yeah, it's not really it's not really major. Um dryness in my legs. Right, okay. And I think trouble. Okay. Well, I'm just gonna ask you some very brief yes or no questions. That's okay. With your symptoms, have you have you had any other symptoms such as fever or temperatures? No. Any nausea or any vomiting? No. Any problems with your bowels? No. And any problems with your urine or water works. No. Otherwise you feel well, do you in yourself? You're eating and drinking, your appetite is well maintained yeah I feel I feel good okay alright fine um in terms of your past medical history do you have any other conditions at all I have diabetes do you know if that's type one or type two type two diabetes okay anything else um no any skin problems no eczema dermatitis for example no that I know of no I haven't been diagnosed no okay which medications do you take forming okay do you have any allergies either to any medications or in general no family history wise is it anything I should be aware of diabetes as well diabetes as well yeah okay again any skin problems uh no not that I know any history of asthma or bowel problems uh no no okay all right um fine in terms of social history you mentioned that you work as a housekeeper um and you you're not always very good at wearing gloves um you recently changed jobs which what where which kind of places do you work in is it mainly residential or is it commercial uh it's a hotel hotel okay after the whole thing like the bedroom bathroom okay do you think there might be a relationship between the two, between the kind of the products you're using and your symptoms? Yeah, I I usually use both for bathrooms, but yeah bathrooms and corridors, not always. Okay. Have your symptoms stopped you from doing any work? Have you had to take time off work recently? Uh yeah, like the past three days, I haven't been able to go to work. Okay, alright. Can I ask a couple of questions? Do you smoke at all? No. Do you drink much in a way of alcohol? Pints a week. Once a week? Uh a couple of pints a week. A couple of pints a week, okay. So very minimal alcohol there. Um have you tried anything for your symptoms? Have you tried anything over the counter, any creams? Yeah, I've tried uh E45. Any luck with that? Yeah, no, I didn't really do anything. No, okay, alright. Um I also tried an anti-stamins, anti-but it didn't help. Okay, alright. Um, Mrs. Parkinson, so I think um based on your story, I think I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis, which is very common in particular people in your in your in your field who are using cleaning products, not using gloves, you can sometimes get a bit of a reaction between the chemicals and your skin. Um moving forwards, there's a couple of options. So, firstly, what we try and do is you know avoid the trigger. So in your case, I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times. Okay, but in terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin, um, we can try some steroid creams to help with inflammation, as well as some stronger emollients, um, which you really need to kind of coat on throughout the day three, four times a day for the next couple of weeks just to help with the moisturizing of your skin. Okay. Um if it still hasn't got better in about a week to two weeks' time, are you willing to come back and see me again? And we can maybe think about other things we can give to you. Okay. Is that all clear? Uh yeah, that sounds good. Great. Do you have any questions for me? Um where do I get the medicines from? So I'll I'll I'll do a prescription for you now and uh send over to your pharmacy. Okay, great. Yeah, um so you said a couple of weeks it should get better, right? I think I g I think a minimum couple of weeks, uh, 10 days to 14 days. Um, and if it still hasn't got better, or indeed if it's getting worse, if it's spreading or your dryness is getting worse, come back and see me sooner. Okay, great. Thank you, Laura. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Bye bye now.
