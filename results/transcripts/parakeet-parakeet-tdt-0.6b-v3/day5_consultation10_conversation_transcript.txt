Hi there, it's Dr. Smith from Babylon. Can you confirm your name, date of birth, and your home address, please? Um the computer. Um I can't hear you at the moment actually. Could you turn it up the volume up? Can I give me a blow now? Yeah, that's better. Thank you. Um okay, sorry about that. Are you in a private place you can have a consultation? Um what can I do for you today? Um I've been having this blinding headache for a few days. Um and it's like really bothering me and uh I find it very hard to focus or like I can't even go to work. Okay, and any headaches in the past before this? Not really, just a on and off. Um I recently had a one for like two days, um, but it just went away with Aperrofen, so nothing like for longer than two days before. So how did this start? Um it just started all of a sudden I woke up one morning with a headache and that was three days ago and I just keep having it. Doesn't really go away with Apobroffin either. I try that, but it just it gets a little bit better, but like doesn't go away. Okay, and whereabouts in your head is the pain? Um it's kind of all over, but I feel like over my right eye is a bit stronger. Okay, any problems with your vision or any problems tolerating the light? Um lights definitely make me more sensitive. Like um, I don't really like strong lights. Um and um yeah, vision, I think I get it's shooting lights sometimes. Um not sure how to explain it, just a bit of a weird kind of vision okay and um any any nausea or vomiting um no feeling a bit sick but not vomiting any tingling or numbness or weakness anywhere um no any change in your smell or taste no no at all um and in the past when you've had headaches what have they been like um I would say quite a normal headaches just um a bit of a pressure in between my eyes um but nothing major okay and with with this has it been there all the time or is it coming and going? Kinda all the time um so when I take up a drop and it gets a bit better so it's a bit like less um it bothers me less but then I still have it is still there um and what would you say the severity is if if 10 is the worst pain you've ever had and zero is nothing what would you say the pain is like I guess it's mostly eight and then it kind of comes down to maybe a five okay and what about at night time are you able to fall asleep? Um yeah I'm sleeping well is it waking you up in the night time? No no no but I can wake up with it in the morning. Okay any worse when you change position or bend over or cough or anything like that? Um sometimes when I stand up quickly I get a bit of a stabbing pain. Um or if I turn my head like it I kind of feel like something is moving inside. Okay. And have you had any uh eye checks recently? Um yeah, I actually had one recently and nothing changed my vision. Okay. And have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears or pain over the sinuses? Any or phlegm? Any any nosebleeds or coffee acne blood or anything? No. And just recently have you been well or have you had any general problems? Any change in your weight or tiredness, lack of energy, anything like that? Um no change of weight, maybe um lack of energy, but maybe because I'm just having this headache so I find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities but you know, when you have this constant headache. Like you've been at work recently? Um I work from home but couldn't really manage to do it all the time. So sometimes I just do the day off. So you've been you've had a headache for three days. H how many days have you missed off work? Um so I work from home all these three days and um first day I worked from home and then um the second day I just took the whole day off and today I just tried to work at home the first half of the day, but I I just stopped in the morning because I couldn't focus. Okay. And any other medical problems in the past? Um I think I only had a problem pain um when I was younger, but no cause was found and that went away, but that's the only thing I know of. Okay. Have you been abroad recently at all? No. Do you take any medications? Um, just a pill. Which one? Um Mercillone. And when did you start that? Um about a year ago. Any side effects with that? Uh no, I don't think so. Have you noticed any any um increased frequency of headaches since you started that? Um, I guess this headache is just very recently, so nothing um three years ago where nothing really changes. Okay. And when you'd had when you've had when you described your headaches in the past, you said they were just general. Did you have any visual symptoms? No. Nausea vomiting with them? No, nothing, none of them. Um yeah, I had a choice in the pharmacy when I got the pill and they said it was normal. And when was that? Uh a year ago. Okay. Um, and any allergies to anything? No. And who do you live with at home? Sorry. Who do you live with at home? Uh just by myself. Okay. And do you smoke? Uh no. Do you drink any alcohol regularly? Yeah. How much in a normal week do you think? Um, probably like three beers once a week. Okay. And do you take any other drugs at all? Um no, apart from the aperrop and I take sometimes and the headache gets really bad. Um so I mean it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache, and you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well? Yeah. But you haven't had a high temperature? Have you checked your temperature? Uh no, I didn't, but I don't really feel overish or anything. Okay. Um, I mean it it it could possibly be a migraine type headache, but in fact, it's still ongoing for three days. We probably should put you into an appointment to get an examination. Um obviously it's if it settles in the meantime, then we can cancel that, but we should do a neurological examination, look at the back of your eyes as well. Okay. Um in terms of medication, I can prescribe you something similar to ibuprofen but a bit stronger, which you can take instead of ibuprofen, and you can take paracetamol at the same time. Okay. So if you're happy to book a appointment with us with the support line for us to do a full examination and start the medication, which I prescribed you take it with food. If if you're you said that when you go to bed your headaches okay and not waking you up in the night time. Yeah, it's not. Um, but you mentioned migraine and that um reminded me that my mum suffers from like she has migraines. Okay. Any other family history of medical problems? Um, no, I didn't answer it, but I know that my mum like she has quite bad migraines, she like has a vomiting and everything like that. Okay, that's fine. Um, I mean, if if in the meantime before your appointment your headache is getting unbearable, getting worse or changing, then call um if it's that bad, then you should go to AE and have an examination. Um you can call us for further advice on that. Okay. Um, when when you have a an examination with us, we'll check your blood pressure as well. Just to make sure your pill is still appropriate for you. Because sometimes if we if we do think it's a migraine then you would have to change your pill if you've had these flashing lights and things like that. Is there anything in the pill that can cause it or is it well it's some pill so that pill if you were having my regular migraines with um flashing lights or other symptoms it wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill particularly we'd have to change it to something else. Alright. But you can carry on with that for the moment. Okay. Have you got any other questions? Um so whether you like um send me a referral to a specialist or teleport to book an appointment with the support team then we can do a full examination then. Okay. Perfect. Alright then take care. Thank you very much. Bye.
