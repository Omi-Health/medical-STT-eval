So just before we we start, is it all right if you could confirm your full name for me, please? Yes. Maria Trabalotsa. Okay. Date and your date of birth. That is the 1st of October 99. Okay. And your email address for me, please. Yes. Mtraba at gmail.com. Okay. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Yes, I think I am, yeah. Good. Right. You've mentioned in your in in your patient notes that you're having some sort of lip swelling and you after you had a sandwich. Is that correct? Yeah, that is, well, I don't think I don't think it was it wasn't a sandwich, but it was it was something with prawns. So basically, I I sometimes go with my friends to to this place called Fet Fuck. And we we regularly have like usually I have like a normal vegetarian soup or something. And yeah, and then I wanted to try something new. Um so what happened was I I ordered a prawn soup. It's it's it's it's called a lax, it's like a soup. I ordered a prawn one this time. Yeah. Um yeah, and then my feel start like my lips start feeling a little weird, just in the in the corner, sort of on the left first. And then I don't know, and then we went back, we had a little bit of a chat of banter. I wasn't really paying attention. Um I feel that that there is a swelling. Yeah, there is like a swelling on my on my upper lip, and it's kind of getting bigger. I don't know what to do. Alright. So when did you have the prawn soup? What time? That was that must have been just after work. So maybe like around seven. Okay. Around seven o'clock. And um, how long did it take to develop the swelling? Well, I wasn't really paying attention, so it must have been like must have been like a half an hour, maybe. Okay, in half an hour you develop the swelling, yeah. Yeah. Okay, and it's getting bigger and bigger. Yeah, it's it's it's you can still feel it like really pumping blood, and it's kind of getting bigger, it feels like it's getting worse. Okay, so just a few more questions. Um, so you mentioned about your swelling of your lips. Is there any feeling of swelling in in your throat? Like your throat is closing up. Any feeling like that? Yeah, actually, I I feel like I can't breathe that well right now. Okay. And do you feel like like your chest is tight? I don't know if it's the chest, it's just generally feels a little difficult. Okay, but yeah, it might be, I'm not sure. Okay. Right. And just a few ha have you ever had these any kind of lip swelling in the past? After eating any food? Yeah. Well maybe. I remember like a year ago. A year ago I was out with my friends. And I think we went like to late night kind of Chinese place. And I remember that I was quite drunk to be honest. And I remember that after like having that very late I've woke up the next morning quite swollen up and had also like felt really bad and quite difficult breathing. Right. But I don't know what it was I had. It was like a curry or something I think okay uh and what did you take at that time? Did you use anything like antihistamine or anything when you had that last time well I generally have asthma so I tell I I take oh what's it called salbutamol inhalers? Yeah. Yeah so I do take that regularly but I've always taken it I generally have acid and any other inhalers is it just the salbutamol that you use any other brown inhalers no I don't think so no okay right and um so do you use antihistamines like cetrazine, loratidine peritin any of those kind of things no about no I do sometimes but I don't know which ones. So I have a peanut allergy as well. Yeah. Like I've always had it. Yeah. And I think I do get antihistamines for that, but I'm not sure which ones. And any point because you had peanut allergy. Any time you had to ever use like an injection? When I was a kid, I think I remember my mom told me about it, but I don't know what it was because I was small and I changed doctors since. Right. Has your mom ever said that you had to go to hospital because you had a severe allergic reaction? Yeah, as if I was like six or something. I I I think. Oh, sorry, the swelling is getting oh, yeah. I think well I was right. Are you okay now? You're busy right now, to be honest. You feel easy. Okay. Right. Do you have any kind of uh antihistamines with you at the moment? No, I don't think I have. Right, okay. So right. Alright, I I'm really a bit worried about you at the moment, Maria. It um I think we need to call an ambulance because um from what history you've been telling me, it sounds like you could be going into what we say an anaphylactic reaction. That's when your throat and your chest, you know, closes in, and you might need an injection, like what your mom's um, you know, what your mom told you as you were a young child. Okay, right. So is there any anyone with you at the moment, or are you alone? I'm alone at the moment. Okay, so hang on the line while I'll call the ambulance, okay, and I'll send them right to you. Okay. And somebody just came. Somebody just came. Yes. I'm not alone anymore. Oh, okay. Somebody just came. So just call the ambulance. Make sure that person's with you till the ambulance comes. Yeah. Um, and because we are worried about an anaphylactic reaction, so you need to go straight away. Could you ask the person whether they have any antihistamines around in the interim while we're waiting? Yes. Uh mom, mom. Do we have any antihistamines around? Yes. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we do. Straight away. And if mom can call, mom, if you can call the uh 9999, yeah, and say that you're there is a suspected anaphylactic reaction and they need to come straight away. Okay, yes, she says she will. Yes. So straight away take the antihistamines in the meantime. All right. Okay, okay. And after you come up from the hospital, do give us a ring back. We might need to sort you out with your injections and things like that. Okay. Yes, yes, I'll do. Yes. All right. Okay, then take care. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye.
