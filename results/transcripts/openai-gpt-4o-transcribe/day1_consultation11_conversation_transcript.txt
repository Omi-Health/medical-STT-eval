Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Can you hear me okay?
I can hear you, but I can't really see you.
That's perfect.
Is that okay? Am I meant to...
It's a connection on the screen.
It's audio. No, no, it's absolutely fine.
Now, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age?
So, my name is Dan Chowdhury. I am 27.
27, okay. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan?
So, I've just been having some troubles. Basically, I guess it's been a little while now, and I've just been feeling not so great.
And it's all come from, like, I think it's diarrhoea, and it's just coming out, like, loads of it.
Like, I go to the toilet, and it's just super watery, and yeah, it doesn't feel very solid.
So, it's just pouring straight from my bum and just coming out.
Yeah, it's just not been very pleasant, and it just doesn't feel like it's getting better.
Wow, no, sorry to hear that. I think that there's a lot going on there. When did it all start, your symptoms?
So, I think it was a few, when I think about it, so Monday, Tuesday, I think it was about three, it's been about three days now.
Okay. And is it mainly diarrhoea? So, you mentioned watery stools. How many times are you going a day, would you say?
So, I feel like it's, like, almost every hour when I'm awake.
Right, wow. Okay, so you're losing a lot of fluid there.
Yeah, so, I mean, I'm trying to drink a lot of water, but yeah, it's just quite a lot, and it's, yeah, I think, I feel like it's just fluids coming out.
Okay. Have you ever seen any blood in your stools?
So, no, I don't remember anything, like, no, I think it's just, nothing like that, there's nothing like that.
Any tummy pain, any pain in your tummy?
Yeah, I mean, I feel a cramp, and then I know it's time to go, right? So, around every hour, I just feel something come up, and then I have to go, so, yeah, I mean, that's kind of the first sign.
Where is this crampy pain, which part of your tummy?
It's kind of, so, when I think about it, it's like, it's like at the bottom, I don't know if that makes sense.
Well, why don't we start with, is it in the middle, or is it to one particular side?
I think it feels pretty, like, in the middle to me, not on any side, left or right.
And does this pain come and go, or is it there constantly?
It comes and goes, it comes and goes.
Okay, and if I was to ask you on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you've ever had, how bad is this pain?
Okay, so, like, so, what do you mean by pain? So, I think it's maybe, is this pain making you double over? Is it ten out of ten the worst pain you've ever had, or is it more of a kind of a mild pain, like a three out of ten?
I guess, so, when I think about it, like, when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it, so I can still sit down, and I can still, like, cover it up, and people don't really notice. I don't know what that means, but maybe is that, like, a six or a seven?
Sort of a six, I think. Okay, okay, all right, good. Apart from pain and diarrhoea, any other symptoms, like nausea, vomiting?
Yeah, I definitely feel kind of nauseous, like, and, like, I have vomited, like, I think it's maybe something to do with, like, whenever I have, like, milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit, and actually, like, yeah, one time I just, like, had some milk, and I just completely vomited it.
Not easy, okay, always.
I've been trying to avoid it, but, yeah.
But the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhoea, is that right?
Sorry, could you repeat that?
The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhoea, is that right?
No, no, it's not.
Okay, okay, all right. Any other symptoms, like fevers or temperatures?
So, yeah, I think I'm pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time, and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that, but it's, yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm not, like, not a normal temperature.
Okay, so you're feeling hot, okay. And in terms of your waterworks, are you passing urine okay?
Yeah, but I guess less frequently, maybe, but, yeah, it seems to be okay.
Okay, all right, fine. And you said that it mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you, for example, gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else with diarrhoea, for example?
So, my brother has actually had something like this for, he has it as well for five days as well, and I'm not, yeah, I can't think of what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally deals with this stuff a lot better than me, but, yeah, that's why.
Is your brother now better?
So, he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not really sure. He said he's had something for a little while as well.
Okay, all right. Are you having anything to eat or drink? I can see you're drinking your coffee, but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down?
So, it just feels like the fluids do go down, but it just feels like it's going straight through. It just feels like it's going straight through.
Okay, all right, fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat, which you kept in?
So, I had some, I mean, I had some lunch today, but, again, it just came out pretty loose.
Okay, all right. And, Dan, moving forward, are you otherwise fit and well, or do you have any other medical history?
So, yeah, I think otherwise I'm fit and well. Yeah, I mean, I'm an okay weight, and I can't think of any related medical history. I mean, like my, yeah, no, I don't think so.
Oh, thank you. You don't take any regular medications, then?
So, I, no, I mean, I've been taking some, like, paracetamols and stuff like that lately, but I haven't been, I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that.
Okay, and do you have any allergies to any medications?
So, I don't have any allergies that I know of.
Okay, what about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems?
So, with bowel, like, is the colon, like, something?
Yeah, so I mean by bowel is the whole gut, really, anything from the mouth or anything?
So, yeah, my dad actually has colon cancer at the moment.
Oh, dear, I'm really sorry to hear that. How is he?
So, from what I heard, he's kind of, so I don't speak to him that often, so I don't know the exact details, and I don't exactly know the full things of, like, the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing, but he's sort of in his third stage. I'm not sure what that means exactly.
Yeah, okay.
So, yeah, it's, he's, yeah, you can, I can see he's kind of weaker, and it's affecting me a lot, and that's, he's quite, I guess he's had it for a little while now.
Well, I'm really sorry to hear that. I'll make a note of that, because it's important to know these kind of details. And socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan?
So, not my brother. He doesn't live with me. I live with my sister and my mum.
Okay. And how are things at home?
I think...
What sense do you mean that?
In general, day-to-day life, are you managing okay? Any particular challenges?
I mean, I think, yeah, it's been tricky going to work with all of this. I dislike taking time off work. I feel like I just want to go when I can, so I try and go. I think at home, yeah, I just haven't really, I don't normally actually eat with my family. I normally buy stuff and that kind of thing, so I don't think it's affected them. And I haven't really been, I haven't really gone into detail with my sister or my mum about it. Yeah, I'd just rather deal with these things.
You mentioned work. What is it you do for work?
So, I work at an office in central London. So, I work in government.
Government. Okay, right. Just a couple of last final questions there. Smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
So, I smoke for like socially, but not like regularly. So, normally if it's a Friday or something like that, I might have a cigarette or something like that.
Sorry?
And alcohol?
So, alcohol, you know, I might have a beer during the weekdays, not many, maybe on Fridays I have more alcohol. Yeah,
