Hello. Hi, my name is Dr. Kumar. I'm one of the GPs here. Can I just get you to confirm your name and date of birth for me, please? Yeah, I'm Maria. Yeah. Date of birth? Sorry? And your date of birth? 27th of March of 19. Again, how can I help today? So, I'm having like a really, really strong headache. I don't know what is happening. I'm quite concerned. So, it started in the morning. I feel like dizzy. My vision is a little bit blurred. Like it's really painful and I'm getting really concerned, especially because I'm having like these changes in the vision. Okay. So, it started this morning. Was it a sudden onset headache? Did it come on suddenly? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And did it come on really bad or did it start off like a slight headache and build up to a severe headache? It came like kind of suddenly. And if 10 is the worst pain you've ever felt in your life, how bad would you say the pain was between 1 and 10? Well, I had the kidney stone, so let's say that that's 10. I have now maybe 5, well, 6, 6 probably. 6 out of 10. But it's more about me being really concerned because this is very weird. Okay, now that's fine. Have you ever had a headache before? Sorry? Have you ever had a headache like this in the past? Well, not really. Okay, so it's a first? Yeah, like this, no, definitely. It's something new. Okay, okay. If you had to say where across the head the headache is, is it across the front, around the back? It's in one side, the left side only. And tell me, what visual problems are you getting? My vision is quite blurry. It's really weird, like some zigzag lines. I don't know how to describe it properly. Okay, and have you tried any painkillers for this already? Yeah, I tried paracetamol, but it didn't work. To be honest, I feel exactly the same. Okay, and what time did you take the paracetamol? How long ago was it you've taken it? Well, the headache started like four hours ago, so I would say like maybe three hours ago because I couldn't stand it. Okay, and your visual problems are still ongoing now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel a little bit better. I cannot stand screens, but yeah, definitely. And when I move, the thing is that if I leave bed, I start to feel like even worse if I move. So I just want to have my head like really not moving. Okay, okay. So have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit? Oh yeah, oh, I forgot to mention, definitely. I vomited twice. Actually, as soon as the headache started, I also vomited. So initially I thought it was something that I ate, but then the headache started to be really bad, and I still feel nausea. To be honest, I'm about to vomit very soon, I think. All right, okay. You've mentioned in the past you've had kidney stones. Any other medical problems? Sorry? You've mentioned that in the past you've had kidney stones. Have you had any other medical problems in the past? Well, not really. Okay, so previously? Yeah, like this, no, definitely.
