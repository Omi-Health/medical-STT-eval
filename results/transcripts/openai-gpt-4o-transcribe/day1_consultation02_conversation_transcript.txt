Hello? Hello, can you hear me well? Yes, I think it's a bit better. It's not very clear, but let's continue anyway. Okay, let's start again. So how can I help you, sir? Yes, so it's been a few days now. I have like a sore and a red skin. It's kind of, it's really itchy and it's like super annoying. So I'd like to find something quick to solve it. No problem, I'm happy to help. Whereabouts on your skin is it affected? Mostly like my chest, my hands, my arms. Like really, it's super annoying, like it's itching a lot, like all the time. And I can't even sleep at night. I really need something quickly to solve it because even at work, when I'm in a meeting and I have to think about my work and focus, like actually focus on my work, it's really annoying because I can't actually think about what I have to say. I'm always like disturbed by this disease. No, no, okay, I'm sad this is obviously affecting you and we'll try our very best to get it sorted out for you. Have you had anything like this before in the past? So yes, earlier I was like prescribed for my eczema and they gave me like some cream and something to, when I was in the shower I had to put something. Okay. Did it help? I mean, at that time, yes, but when the symptoms appear again, I tried those and it didn't work. I've tried a few things, like I bought a steroid cream at the pharmacy last night, but it apparently didn't help because it's still itching a lot today. Okay. Yeah. Do you remember the name of the cream you bought? Steroid cream. Okay, steroid. Would you say the symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different? It's much more like itchy and my eczema was more like only in the arms and now it's also on the chest and on the hands as well. Yeah. I like, for instance, hiking during the weekends and I can't really do it anymore because it's like very, like I went into that last weekend and it was super painful and I have to take like showers every day to be able to kind of ease this itching part, which is very, very annoying. No, well, okay. So you mentioned the itchiness. You also mentioned it's been quite sore. Have you noticed any bleeding or discharge from your skins? No. So my skin is a bit cracked in some parts, like kind of cracked, if you see what I mean. Okay. But yeah. You haven't noticed any other pus or blood coming out of your skin? No. And you mentioned it all started three days ago? Four days ago. Four days ago. Are you aware of any triggers or anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start? So, for example, have you changed your shower gel, any clothing? Have you been around anyone else? No, it's actually like it's very annoying because I'm thinking about maybe I should change something because I haven't and I don't understand and I'm kind of afraid of asking people around me because it's kind of, you know, I don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions. It's kind of intimate. And so I will do your help now. No, no, no. Okay, that's okay. Fine. So just to re-summarize, for the last four days you've had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, mainly your chest. And did you also mention your arms and legs as well? No, just the chest, hands and like inside the elbows. Okay. Anything on your face at all? In my what? On your face? Oh, on my face? No. No, okay. And apart from this, any other symptoms have you noticed, for example, have you noticed any temperature or fevers? No, just itching. Itching. Nothing else. Okay. So your bowels are working okay, your chest is okay, no cough, no breathing difficulties? No. You're passing urine okay? I think so. Okay. All right. It's always good to know, so I mean, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Any what? Any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? So I had eczema before, so maybe it's this, but it seems like more like my eczema was only on the arms, so I'm not sure. I really have no idea. Okay. No, that's okay. So normally at this stage I'd like to examine you to see the rash yourself and see exactly what type of rash it is, but from what you've told me, you mentioned you've got some dry skin and some cracked skin as well, and it's been very itchy. And so with your background of eczema, sorry, there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you which I completely forgot, my apologies. Apart from the eczema, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? No, I just had asthma in the past, but not anymore. Not anymore, okay. And do you take any regular medications at the moment? No. No, okay. Do you have any allergies to anything? Sorry, yeah. Sorry, I was going to say, do you have any allergies to anything? Hello? Hello, yes. Oh, can you hear me? Sorry, I think it cracked. Do you have any allergies at all? Oh, allergies, no. No, okay. And tell me about your situation at home. Who do you live with? So I live with a few flatmates. So you know I'm 31, I have a full-time job, and so I'm living with a few people to save money. Okay, and what do you do for work? I work at a pharmaceutical company, so it's been a few years now. It's kind of interesting, we're working, I'm a kind of project manager. Do you want to know more about it? Okay. No, no, no, that's absolutely fine. There's a couple of questions I want to ask you which can sometimes affect your symptoms. Do you smoke at all? No. No, and do you drink much in the way of alcohol? You know, once in a while I like hanging out with people once in a while, so yeah, I'd say a few beers per week, something like this. Nothing crazy. I used to drink a lot more when I was younger, but it's been okay. Okay, I've got to say at this stage, I've got to say the sound quality is not great, but I will continue because we've come this far. So based on everything you mentioned, sir, I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema, the reason being that you said it's quite itchy, it's mainly affecting your chest and your back, and having looked at your skin, the rash does appear quite familiar. You mentioned using steroid creams yesterday from the pharmacy. I wonder whether giving you stronger prescription of a steroid may be beneficial, which I'm happy to prescribe to you today, as well as I'm going to give you some emollients which helps to moisturise the skin, which you can use in the bath and shower, and it's definitely worth using that for the first seven to ten days before we make a decision on whether it's working or not. It's also worth using antihistamines, which you can sometimes buy over the counter, things like loratadine or pyrroton, which can help the itchiness of your skin, and it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap, because if that's causing your symptoms then we need to have a discussion about that next time I see you. Okay, I have tried antihistamines lately but it didn't really help. Could you say that again, sorry? I have tried the antihistamines, but it didn't really help. It didn't, okay. So something for you to think about, you can get different types of antihistamines, I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well, something like fexafenidine, which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying, it's not going to do you any harm, but I certainly think using the steroids and the emollients on a regular basis over the next week to ten days should hopefully control your symptoms, but do come back and see me next week if things don't get better. That sounds good. Okay, do you have any questions for me? No, that's it. Okay, well I wish you all the best. Thank you very much. Thank you, have a good day. Bye, thank you doctor, bye.
