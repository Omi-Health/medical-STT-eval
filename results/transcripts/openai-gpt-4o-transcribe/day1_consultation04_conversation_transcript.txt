Alex? Oh, hello? I can hear me. Yeah. Okay, great. How can I help you this morning, sir?
All right. So I've been feeling I've been feeling kind of under the weather for the past four days
it started with a
Sore throat and runny nose and it's sort of
It's sort of going into a cough now
The sore throat is kind of going away, but I'm starting to cough
Okay, and you mentioned a runny nose
Again, what kind of discharge is coming out? Is it clear or is it a bit more colored?
Yeah, yeah, it's it's clear but
It's sort of getting my nose stuffed all the time. It's very hard to get it free. Okay, so you feel quite congested?
Yeah, quite congested. Okay, fine. You also mentioned a cough as well. Can you come a bit more about that?
Yeah, that started recently like just
maybe yesterday and
It's a it's dry for now
It's not very painful, but it's sort of there all the time. Okay, and is it worse at any particular time of the day?
Sorry, is it worse at any particular time of the day for example in the evenings, nighttime, mornings?
Or just throughout the day?
No, it's sort of constant. I forgot to mention that I'm also having night sweats
That's very odd actually
Makes me a bit tired
I can imagine, yes, and this is again been going on for the last three four days has it? Yeah, yes. Okay
Right, okay. Have you noticed any fevers or temperatures at all?
I
Had some some fever in the beginning, but it's now sort of going down. I've been taking some paracetamol and ibuprofen
And they help. That's very sensible
Very good
In terms of your chest otherwise, have you any difficulty breathing or any pain in your chest?
So no pain in chest, but I noticed that I
Feel a bit winded on
Exertion so if I I haven't been going going to the gym best
Because of that
When you say winded, do you feel more short of breath would you say on exertion?
Yeah, yeah, and that's mainly on exercise, but when you're resting there's no problem
Yeah, yeah when I'm resting it's okay, so I've been actually going to work and sort of managing
Okay, just a couple of other questions sir, if you don't mind. Any pain in your ears at all?
No. You don't feel blocked or any discharge coming out of your ears?
I don't think so. Okay, fine. What I'm gonna do, I'm just gonna run through a few
Yes, no questions if you don't mind, just a review of your systems. Any headaches at all?
Yeah, yeah that that's still that's still there. Whereabouts are the headaches?
Just sort of general
And they're not they're not always there, but you know every now and then they would come and go
Okay, and with these headaches have you any problems with your with your eyesight, your vision?
No. Any difficulty with seeing bright lights?
No, I don't think so. No, okay
And just moving down now, in terms of any any feeling of nausea or any vomiting?
None of that. Okay, tell me about your bowels, are your bowels working okay?
Yeah, yeah, I think so. You're passing urine okay?
Yeah, yeah. How's your appetite sir?
Yeah, I've been drinking a little bit more than the usual, but so other than that it's good.
And you're eating and drinking, are you eating okay otherwise?
Maybe a bit less than what I would usually have. Okay, have you noticed any funny rashes at all on your skin?
No, no. And any general muscle pain or aches, joint pains?
Yeah, yeah, that's sort of started in the past couple of days. Yeah, okay
All right, and just have a look at the rest of your history. Are you otherwise fit and well or do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of?
Otherwise I'm fine. There isn't anything that I'm taking or being treated for. Okay, so you're otherwise fit and well.
Any allergies at all to any medications I should be aware of?
No, no. Okay, any family history at all sir, anything relevant in the family that I should be aware of? Anything like diabetes, high blood pressure?
Yeah, my grandma has diabetes. Your brother? My grandma. You say grandma, sorry my apologies. Grandma, okay. Do you know what type of diabetes it is? Is it type one? I think it's type two. Okay, anything else which you think is significant?
Yeah, I think one of my great granddads had an eczema. Okay, just moving on to what we say social history, just to get to know you a bit more as a person. Who do you live with at home? I live alone. Okay, and you said you're working at the moment, is that right? Yeah. What do you do for work? I'm an accountant. Okay, and how's your work going at the moment? Has it been affecting your work? A little bit. I've been a bit slower and you know it's a bit of a stressful period just around the end of the year. Okay, is that stress affecting your mood at all in any way? No, I think it's the good kind of stress. It's good work. If there's anything you ever want to talk to me about, you can always come and see me about your mood and stress, anxiety. We're happy to help. No, no, I like my job. It's just, you know, it's a bit more work than usual. Okay, and just very briefly, in terms of smoking, do you smoke at all? Yeah, occasionally, you know, cigars and things on company parties. Okay, so not regular. And what about alcohol? Occasionally, I would have some. I'm not a very big drinker. Okay, and socially with work? Yeah. Okay, so just having listened to your story, really just to summarize, you know, it's the last four days you've been feeling generally quite unwell, sore throat, runny nose, a bit of a dry cough, bit of muscle pain, weakness, had an initial fever, but now settled. I don't think there's a lot to worry about. I think you probably have, you know, a bit of a viral, what we say viral illness, maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection, or maybe early signs of a flu. It normally lasts about seven to 10 days and just gets better really over time. But things you can do to really help yourself is get plenty of rest. I'll probably advise you taking a day or two off work if you can, making yourself, you know, pushing fluids and make yourself well hydrated, continuing with the regular paracetamol and ibuprofen. And we should see how things go really. If next week is still not better, I'd like you to come back and see me. Is that clear? Does that make sense? Yeah, that's all good. It makes sense. I think I'll take a couple of days off. Yeah. And things look out for if you're really not getting better, if you have a high fever or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored or chest pain, I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner. Give me a call. And we can help you out, okay? Yeah, understood. I'll take care. Great. Have a great day. Good luck with your work. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye.
