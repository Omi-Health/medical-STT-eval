Hi there, good morning. Hi, good morning. I'm Dr. Dean Mezzer from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Okay, great. So before we start your appointment, could you please confirm your full name and date of birth? Yes, sure. My name is Tim Gowers, and I was born in 1958 on the 8th of August. That's great. Thank you so much for that. You look a lot younger. That would make you roughly about 50 years old, 51 years old. Is that correct? Yeah, around that. Yeah, about 60. Yeah. Okay, perfect. Nice to see you this morning. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes, I am. Yeah. Okay, fantastic. So how can I help you today? Yeah, I was having a bit of chest discomfort. So I was doing some gardening a couple of hours ago, and I felt not exactly a pain, but like a pressure on my chest. Feels like someone's sitting on my chest. And I've noticed a bit of nausea, no vomiting, but pretty sweaty, short of breath. And it kind of feels like someone's sitting on my chest. Right, okay. Do you have these symptoms right now or have they gone off now? No, they're still present. Okay, so you've still got the chest discomfort right now? Yes. Okay. We're probably going to have to call an ambulance for you. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to task my colleague next to me to sort that out. While we do that, I'm going to ask you a few more questions, okay? Sure. A bit more information to the ambulance team when they arrive, okay? Sure. So just to double check, where exactly in the chest is the pain? It's in the middle of my chest, over my pecs. So yeah, but not necessarily to one side. It's quite a diffuse pain. Right. Is it spreading anywhere else, like down to your arm, up to the jaw, the neck, anything like that? Yeah, it's mainly my left arm. It's feeling a little bit painful in my shoulder as well. Right, okay. Do you remember what you were doing at the time? Yeah, so it started just when I was gardening, so nothing that was too strenuous. I was just kneeling down and yeah, wasn't running or anything. I wasn't doing any physical exercise. Cool, okay. And how much activity do you do normally? Do you walk a lot or do you run or do you go to doing anything? No, I generally don't do much activity at all. Have you had this before? No, this is the first time actually. Right, okay. Are you aware of any palpitations, like your heart beating faster or more prominently than normal? Yeah, it's beating a bit faster now. I think that's because I'm a little bit stressed about the situation, but I haven't noticed it beating faster than usual today. So I know you're stressed. We've got an ambulance coming on the way, okay? So we'll take care of everything, so don't worry. Okay, thank you. Are you alone in the house with you at the moment? No, no one's in the house at the moment. Okay. And is your front door open? Yes, it's open. Okay, so maybe we'll speak maybe in the hallway to the front door. Have the front door open so that in case people need access, they can access you. All right, so are you a smoker at all? Yeah, I smoke a fair bit, so I smoke about 10 cigarettes a day. Yeah. How long have you been smoking for? For the past 15 years. 15 years, okay. Do you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol, diabetes? Yeah, I have high blood pressure, but not diabetes. Okay. Have you ever had your cholesterol checked? No. Okay, all right. Now, in terms of what happens from here, the ambulance team will assess you, and then they may take you in to one hospital or another based on how bad, what the ECG looks like and what kind of treatment you might need, okay? Okay. What I'm going to do is we'll stay on the line for the time being. Okay. Until they come, and then once they come, then I'll hand over to them and I'll explain what's going on, all right? Okay, sure. Okay. Thank you. We'll end the conversation now for the purposes. Yeah, that's okay. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, thanks. Bye. Thank you. Bye.
