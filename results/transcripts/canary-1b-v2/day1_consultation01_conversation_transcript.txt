I need to stay close to the toilet and yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities. Okay. Sorry to hear that. And when you say diarrhea, what do you mean by diarrhea? Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often or are your stools more loose? Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stol, going to the toilet quite often, and like some pain in my lower stomach.

And can you describe the pain to me? Yeah, it feels like a cramp, like a muscular cramp, and yeah, I feel a bit weak and shaky. Okay. And is the pain, is it there all the time or does it come and go? It comes and go. Does the pain move anywhere else, for example, towards your back? No, just mainly in my stomach. Okay. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well. What do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been having, have you been feeling feverish for example? Yeah, it doesn't feel like yeah, I just feel weak. I haven't had a fever at the moment, but I did notice a temperature when the symptoms started, so yeah, around three or four days ago. Did you measure your temperature then? Yeah, I didn't measure my temperature, no, but I felt just a little hot. Okay, okay. Any other symptoms like swimming or like? No. And any vomiting at all? Yeah, so I vomited at the start of the symptoms, but now I've stopped vomiting. You stopped vomiting, okay. And was your vomit, I know it's not nice to talk about, but was it just normal food color? Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit. Yeah, and there was no blood in your vomit, is that right? No blood, no. No, okay. And any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned a tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhea, you mentioned your vomiting. Anything else that comes to mind? I had a loss of appetite. I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids. Okay, so you're drinking fluids. What kind of foods have you managed to eat, if anything? Just soups and yeah, light foods like smoothies and yeah, liquid foods mainly. Okay, fine. And so you started three days ago, the symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms to kick on? So, for example, things like taking away food or eating outside or being around other people who had similar symptoms? Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago. But other than that, I've been eating normally. I think, I think, unusual, yeah. Do you remember where you ate? Yeah, I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Okay. Anyone else on well with similar symptoms? So no one else in the family. So a wife and two kids and one child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea, there's no one with the same symptoms. Okay, okay, fine. Right, and in terms of your overall health, are you normally fit and well? Yeah, I mean, other than asthma, I use an inhaler, everything else is fine. Okay. And is your asthma well controlled? Yeah, that's fine. Just, yeah, use an inhaler and that's under control. Fine. And you don't have any other tummy problems, bowel problems that I should be aware of? No. No, okay. And apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications? No, no other medications. Okay, fine. And in terms of just your everyday life, you said it's been affecting your life. Yeah. In what way has it been affecting your life? So I need to stay close to the toilet because I go quite frequently during these past three days. Okay. Yeah, other than that, it's Yeah, that's the main concern. And are you currently working at the moment? Yeah, I work. What do you do at work? I'm a accountant.. Okay. Have you been going to work the last three days or have you been at home? Yeah, I've been going to work. Okay. That must be difficult for you then. Yeah, it's been quite difficult. Right. And you said you mentioned you live with a wife and two children, is that right? Yes. Yeah. All right. Just a couple of other questions we need to ask. Do you smoke at all? No, I don't smoke. And do you drink a lot in the way of alcohol? No, I don't drink alcohol. Okay. So normally at this stage I'd like to examine you if that's okay. But having listened to your stories, I think just to recap, you've been for the last three days having loose stolic diarrhea, a bit of stomach pain, mainly in the left hand, and vomiting and feeling generally quite weak and lethargic. You mentioned you had this Chinese takeaway as well three days ago, and I wonder if that might be the cause of your problems. It seems like you may have something called gastroenteritis, which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your stomach, mainly caused by viruses, but it can be a possibility of bacteria causing your symptoms. At this stage, what we would recommend is just what we say conservative management. So I don't think you need anything like antibiotics is really just to make sure you're well hydrated. So drinking fluids. There are things like dirolite you can get from the pharmacy, which it's it helps to replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. Okay. And if you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would say recommend that in the first, you know, first couple of days.. If you're feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. I would certainly advise you to take some time at work. Actually, I know you're quite keen to work, but I would say in the next two to three days, as the infection clears from your system, just take some time off and rest. If your symptoms haven't gotten better in three to four days, I'd like to come back and see you again. Because if it's ongoing, then we have to wonder if there's something else causing the symptoms. And we may need to do further tests like taking a sample of your stall so we can test that, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, sure, yeah. How's that sound? That sounds great, yeah, yeah. Do you have any questions for me? No, no further questions, so Okay, is the treatment plan clear? Yeah, yeah, that's that's very clear, thank you. Great, well, I wish you all the best. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Bye.
