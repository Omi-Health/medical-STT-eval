Well, how can I help you this afternoon? Yes, so I have soreness in my fingers and my finger, like the skin on my hands is kind of cracked. Okay, when when did this all start? A couple of months ago, like three, four months ago. So it's been that long, has it? Yeah. Okay. And so you mentioned your, is it the skin in your hands mainly that's dry? Yeah, I haven't noticed. I mean, I have dryness, like, you know, in other parts, like my legs, but it's not, it's not very, it's not severe. It's just, you know, I've always, you know, I don't hydrate very much. So. Right. Okay. Yeah. Like it's very, it's very bad in my hands. Okay. Can I ask why you have come to see me today? Is it because it's got worse recently, your symptoms? Yeah. I mean, it's gotten to a point where it hurts a lot and I can't really. do my job. So I thought I should probably get it checked out. Yeah, that sounds like a very sensible plan. And which part of your hand is affected mainly? The palm. Okay, all right. Have you noticed any itchiness on your palms? Yeah, it's itchy. Not all the time, but yeah, it does itch. Okay. Any blooding at all? I don't, I mean, no, I don't think so. Scratching yourself, you scratching yourself often and bleeding? Yeah, I guess when I've scratched it, yeah, it has blood sometimes, but yeah, otherwise it hasn't blooded on its own. Okay. Fine. Okay, sorry. I'm just going to write notes as we go along. And you mentioned the skin is quite cracked as well, is that right? Yeah, that's right. Okay, all right. I know this is a long time ago, but do you remember how it all started? What were you doing at the time when it all started? Is there anything you may have done to bring your symptoms on? I mean, I am I do'm not always very good at wearing gloves, but that could be related. I changed jobs four months ago. I've been working as a housekeeper for a while though, but that's the only thing I can think of. Yeah, I think that might be quite important actually. I think there's definitely a maybe a correlation between the two. Fine. And so you mentioned something about having general dryness. Is that you mentioned your legs as well? Yeah. Yeah, but is that sorry. Is that something you've had for a while now? Yeah, it's not really, it's not's just a little bit of dryness in my legs. Right, okay. Okay, I'm just going to ask you some very brief yes or no questions, that's okay. With your symptoms, have you had any other symptoms such as fever or temperatures? No. Any nausea or any vomiting? No. Any problems with your bellies? No. And any problems with your urine or water works? No. Otherwise, you feel well, do you? And you eat and drink, your appetite is well maintained? Yeah, I feel good. Okay, all right, fine. Fine, um, in terms of your past medical history, do you have any other conditions at all? I have diabetes. Do you know if that's type 1 or type 2? Type 2. Diabetes, okay. Anything else? Um, no. Any skin problems? No. Eczema, dermatitis, for example? Not that I know of, no, I haven't been diagnosed with it. No, okay. What medications do you take? No formin. No formin, okay. Do you have any allergies either to any medications or in general? No. Okay, family history wise, is it anything I should be aware of? Diabetes as well. Diabetes as well? Yes. Okay, again, any skin problems? Uh, no, not that I know. Any history of asthma or bowel problems? Uh, no. Okay, all right. Fine, in terms of social history, you mentioned that you work as a housekeeper and you're not always very good at wearing gloves. You recently changed jobs. Which, what, what kind of places do you work in?? Is it mainly residential or is it commercial? It's a hotel. Hotel, okay. I do the whole thing, like the bedroom, bathroom, corridors. Okay. Do you think there might be a relationship between the two, between the kind of products you're using and your symptoms? Yeah, I usually use both for bathrooms, but yeah, bedrooms and corridors not always. Okay. Have your symptoms stopped you from doing any work? Have you had to take time off work recently? Yeah, like the past three days I haven't been able to go to work. Okay, all right. Can I ask a couple of questions? Do you smoke at all? No. Do you drink a lot in terms of alcohol? A pints a week. Once a week? A couple of pints a week. A couple of pints a week, okay. So very minimal alcohol there. Have you tried anything for your symptoms? Have you tried anything over the counter? Any creams? Yeah, I've tried E40 times. Any luck with that? Yeah, no, I didn't really do anything. No, okay, all right. I tried an antihistamine, but it didn't. Okay, all right. Mrs. Parkinson, so I think based on your story, I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis, which is very common, particularly in people in your field who are using cleaning products, not using gloves. You can sometimes get a bit of a reaction between the chemicals and your skin. So moving forward, there's a couple of options. So firstly, what we try and do is, you know, avoid the trigger. So in your case, I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when when cleaning at all times. In terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin, we can try some steroid creams to help with inflammation as well as some stronger emollients, which you really need to coat on throughout the day three, four times a day for the next couple of weeks just to help with the moisturizing of your skin. If it still hasn't gotten better in about a week to two weeks time, I really want to come back and see me again and we can maybe think about other things we can give you. Okay. Is that all clear? Yeah, that sounds good. Great, do you have any questions for me me? Where do I get the medicines from? Oh, so I'll do a prescription for you now and send it over to your pharmacy. Okay, great. Yeah. So you said a couple of weeks it should get better, right? I think a minimum couple of weeks, ten days to fourteen days, and if it still hasn't gotten better or indeed if it's getting worse, if it's spreading or the dryness is getting worse, come back and see me sooner. Okay, great. Thank you, Laura. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much. See you later. Bye bye now.
