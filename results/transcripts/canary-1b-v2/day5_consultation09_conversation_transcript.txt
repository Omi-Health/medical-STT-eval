Yeah, it's Matt Carter and it's 14th of August 1989 and what was the last bit? Your address. It's one Babylon Avenue. And are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today? Yes. Can I do for you? And it coming I don't really know what's been going on but it's just aching all over for. Definitely the last six weeks, it might have been slightly longer than that, but it's just sort of that feeling really tired, run down. Okay, so when when do you think you were last well? Where are we now? We've just started April. Definitely Christmas New Year, I felt relatively well, I think. So since then, actually yeah, I was on holiday in the States and yeah, it probably coincided with sometime around then, end of January, start of February. So do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you came back? Probably a couple of weeks after I came back. And were you well when you were on holiday? Yeah, I had a great time, very active. Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhea, vomiting, anything like that? Um, no, not that I recall. Um, yeah, not, no, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards. Okay, so just tell me what symptoms you've been having in terms of just your general health, any persistent cold symptoms or ear aches, sore throat, chest cold? Cough, shortness of breath, flemme, anything like that? No. Any change in your weight at all? I don't think so. I'm probably less hungry but no weight change, just a bit. Are you eating different amounts? Yeah, probably slightly smaller portions or yeah, more of an effort to actually eat everything that's in front of me. Any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat or abdominal pain? No. Any change in your bowel habit, diarrhea, vomiting or blood in the stool? No. Any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine? No, that's all fine. Okay, and any other general symptoms like rashes? I don't have any rashes now. Okay. In fact, I've got a photo on my phone and if that's helpful. Okay. I'll try and show you, hang on. Because this, yeah, this was weird. This sort of came up and then disappeared after a couple of weeks. Where's the light? I don't know. That. Okay. Yeah, whereabouts was it? I think sort of calf, back of my calf, because I didn't notice it my wife noticed actually When did you first notice it? Probably around the end of February, the middle to end of February and then it didn't actually cause too much icing or anything at the time and I it faded over a couple of weeks I guess. Did you have any fevers at that time? To be honest, that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat I had. So possibly a little feverish, but I'd put it down to that. Do you know where you got that when it started? Had you been walking? Did you get any bites that you noticed? I definitely like I do quite a lot walking and we did quite a lot while we were out in the holiday as well, but definitely yeah. I mean, I don't remember any bites. I don't remember seeing anything bitten, but you often, like, yeah, as you're walking through, I was in shorts and boots, but you feel the outfit. Whereabouts were you in the States? Just sort of near Yosemite. Okay. And any headaches, blood, vision, tingling, numbness? Um, no. So, the sort of headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy. Oh, we can add that. It's better. And have you been able to go to work as usual? Um, I've been going to work. I don't know how effective it's been, but yeah, I've been What's your job? I work for a health technology company actually. Okay. And has your concentration been affected or your tiredness levels in the daytime at work? Yeah, definitely sort of tired and um. And yeah, less energy, sort of. Yeah, I'm engaged then I would normally be. Have you been able to exercise okay? Not as much. I I don't know if it's I haven't been able or I've just been a little lazy with it. I'm not exercising as much as I would normally. Okay. And how's your mental health, your stress levels? I'm pretty good at the moment actually. Like, it previously that has been a problem but, um, other than sort of physically feeling a bit. Crappy, I'm yeah, in a pretty good place. Okay, apart from that rache, any other races on your skin or swelling of your joints or pain in your joints? Yeah, sort of aching shoulders, back, the hips, knees, but sort of not any swelling that you've noticed? No. What happened to wrists, ankles, toes? No. Okay, and any other significant medical problems in the past? I mean, ADHD, but now? Pardon? Asthma and hey fever if they help. Okay, any flower obscure asthma recently? No, pretty well controlled. Do you take any regular inhalers or other medication? Yeah, I've got one of those preventatives, I think, yeah, which I take twice a day, but I haven't used myself. You haven't been used yet, so? I have been using the everyday for the morning and night, but not the, uh, salveolon. Okay. And any, um, do you take any other medications? Um, oh, there's a, I think, um. One of the unnecessary pharmaceutical, it might be kerosene, can I get that from just from the pharmacy? Yeah, that's fine. And do you smoke? Drinking the alcohol? Sorry, occasionally that was. Okay, and who do you live with at home? Just my wife. Sorry, so with this rash we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms and just because of your symptoms which have been ongoing for six weeks that's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels. I think it's important to get some blood tests checking all the neutral things like liver, kidneys, blood count, etc. but also some more specific things like a bacterial infection you can sometimes get including one that you can get which can produce a rash like that. So that would involve blood tests. Are you happy to do that? Yeah, I'm generally happy with blood tests. What's the infection? Well, you can get a you can get a bacterial infection caused it's called it's called Lyme disease that you can get a ration that from a tick foot. So that's something we would do a test for as well. And if that comes back positive then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it. So it's definitely worth checking for, but we would also check just for other things which can cause reduced energy tiredness and aching for persistent over six weeks. Okay. So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line and then when you've had that the test arrange a follow up about a week after you've had the test done. Okay, so do the test first and then and that follow up we can just do over the phone again? Or we can do that over the phone to start with. Excellent. Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you very much. Oh, sorry, you broke up a bit there. Any other questions? Oh, no, not no. Okay, that's great. Take care. Take care. Thank you. Bye. Sorry.
