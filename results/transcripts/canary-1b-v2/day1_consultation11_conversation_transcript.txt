Hello? Hello? Hello. Can you hear me okay? I can hear you but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Is that okay? Am I meant to just make a connection on the screen? It's audio. No, no, it's absolutely fine. Now, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? So, my name is Dan Chowdury. I am 27. 27. Okay. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan? So I've just been having some troubles. Basically, it's been a little while now and I've just been feeling not so great. And it's all come from like, it's like basically I think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out like a lot of it. Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it, yeah, it doesn't feel very solid. It's just it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out. And it's, yeah, it's just not, not being very pleasant and like I just it just kind of hasn't it doesn't feel like it's getting better so wow no sorry to hear it seems like there's a lot going on there well when did it all start your symptoms? So I think it was a few when I think about it so Monday Tuesday I I think it was about three it's been about three days now okay and it's mainly diarrhea so you mentioned watery stools how many times are you going a day would you say? So I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Right, well, okay, so you're losing a lot of fluid there. Yeah, so I mean, I'm trying to drink a lot of water, but yeah, it's just quite a lot and it's yeah, I think I feel like it's just fluids coming out. Okay, have you lost any blood in your stools? So, I No, I don't I don't remember anything like No, I think it's just nothing like that. There's nothing like that. Any, any stomach pain? Any, any pain in your stomach? with yeah I mean I I feel I feel a cramp and then I know it's time to go right so around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go so yeah I mean that's that's the kind of the first sign where is this crampy pain which part of your stomach is kind of I still want to if I think about it it's like it's like at the bottom I don't know if that makes sense um well why do we start with is it is in the middle or is it to one particular side I think it feels pretty like in the middle. to me, not on either side, left or right. Okay. And does this pain come and go or is it there constantly? It comes and goes. It comes and goes. Okay. And if I was asking a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you've ever had, how bad is this pain? Okay. So like, um, so what do you mean by pain? So I think it's pain. Is this pain making you double over? Is it ten? Is it ten out of ten the worst pain you've ever had? Or is it more of a kind of mild pain, like a three out of ten? I guess so. When I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it. So I can still sit down and I can still, like, cover it up and people don't really notice. So I don't know what that means, but maybe is that like a six or a seven? I think it's a total of six, actually. Okay. All right, good. And apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Yeah, I defin've vomited. And when I like, I think it's maybe something to do with, like, whenever I have milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit. And actually, like, yeah, one time I just had some milk and I just completely vomited it. Not to eat. Okay, anyways. I've been trying to avoid it, but, um, yeah. The vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea, is that right? Sorry, could you repeat that? The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhea, is that right? I know, no, it's not. Okay, okay, all right. Any other symptoms like fever or temperature? So yeah, I think I am pretty I feel kind of really hot all the time and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that, but it's yeah, I'm okay. Sure, I'm not like not a normal temperature. Okay, so you feel hot, okay. And in terms of your water works, are you passing urine okay? Yeah, but I guess less frequently maybe, but yeah, it seems to be okay. Okay, always fine. And you said, mentioning three days ago, was when it all started. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you, for example, gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around someone else with diarrhea, for example? So I know, so my, my brother has actually had something like this for, he has it as well for five days as well. And I, I'm not, yeah, I can't think of what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally can deal, deals with this stuff a lot better than me, but yeah, that's why. Is your brother now better? So he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not I'm not really sure. He said he said he had had something for a little while as well. Okay, all right. Are you having something to eat and drink? I can see you're drinking your coffee, but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? So it just feels like the fluids go down, but it just feels like it's going straight through. It just feels like it's going straight through. Okay, all right, fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat, which kept which kept in. So I had some I mean, I had some lunch today, but again, it just it just came out pretty loose. Okay, all right. And Dan, moving forward, are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical history? So I Yeah, I think I think otherwise I'm fitting well. I Yeah, I mean, I'm an okay weight and. I can't think of any related medical history. I mean, like my Yeah, I No, I don't think so. I'll take it you don't take any regular medications then? So I No, I mean I've been taking some like paracetamol and stuff like that lately, but I haven't been I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications? So I don't have any allergies that I know of. Okay. And what about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? Bowel would bow like does the colon like something? Yeah. So what I mean by bowel is a whole gut really. So my, yeah, my, my dad actually has colon cancer at the moment. Oh, dear. I'm very sorry to hear that. How's he? So, um, from what I heard, he's kind of So I don't I don't speak to him that often. So I don't I don't know the exact details and I don't know exactly the full things like the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing, but he's sort of in his third stage. I'm not sure what that means exactly. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so yeah, it's, it's, um, he's, yeah, you can, I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting him a lot. And, um, that's, I think he's quite, I guess he's, um, had it for a little while now. Well, I'm researching. I'll make a note about it because it's always important to know these kind of details. Um, and socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan? So, not my brother, he doesn't live with me. I'm I live with my sister and my mom. Okay. And how are things at home? Generally, in what sense do you mean that? Just in general, everyday life, are you managing okay? Any particular challenges? I mean, I think, yeah, it's been it's been tricky going to work with all this. I don't like. Taking time off work, I feel like I just want to go when I can. So I try and go. I think at home, yeah, I just I haven't really I don't normally actually eat with my family. I normally I'm buying stuff and that kind of thing. So I don't think it's affected them. And I haven't really been, I haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mom about it. Yeah, I'd I'd rather deal with these things. So. You mentioned work. Where do you do for work? So I work at a I work at an office in central London. So I work in government. Government, okay. So office, okay, right. Just a couple of last final couple of questions. Smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink a lot in terms of alcohol? So I smoke. I smoke for like social, but not like regularly. So normally if it's a Friday or something like that, I might have a cigarette or something like that, but Sorry. And alcohol? So alcohol, you know, I might have a beer during the weekdays, maybe not that many maybe. On Fridays, I have more alcohol, but yeah, I buy a lot more units on it, I suppose, not every week, but maybe. Once or twice a month, but yeah, I'll go out with my friends and we'll drink a lot, so that's yeah. Well, thank you for sharing with me, that's very helpful to know. So, Dan, just as a conclusion, just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis. Okay. A bit of a basic infection of your stomach, of your gastro. There's nothing to worry about. I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days, just like it did for your brother. Drink, make sure you drink a lot of like normal water. I just feel like every time I Well, it's just coming out. Their fluid is probably best, but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. So you can get things like Dyrolite, which is a fluid replacement we can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth recommending that. Do I need a prescription for that? No, you can just get it over the counter. Okay. You can try just, you know, regular paracetamol if you are feverish, but if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so 48 hours, I want you to give me a call back because, um, you know, if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations, okay? But I think let's see how you're the next one to two days. Okay. And we'll catch up soon, okay? Okay. So you're saying that I should, I could, uh, I'll try and buy this diarrhea light. What, what should I do in terms of, um, food and that kind of thing? Should I just go to the fluids? Food dissolve. Yeah, absolutely. So clear fluids. You can use soft diet, things like soup, mash, and then gradually build up as much as your body can tolerate. Um, but really let's try and keep ourselves well hydrated first, okay? Okay, is it okay for me to continue having like paracetamol and things like that? Absolutely, if you're having if you've got a bit of a tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think paracetamol is very sensible. Okay. Okay, try and avoid alcohol if you can. Okay, I'll try, yeah. Okay, all right, Dan. Okay. Thank you for your help. All right, thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks for helping me out. Was that bad enough? Okay.
