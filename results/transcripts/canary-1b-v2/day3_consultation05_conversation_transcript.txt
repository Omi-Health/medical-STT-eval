Okay, and your address for me please. I live on SW 400 NG. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Yeah. Okay. So you've mentioned that you're feeling dizzy, is it? You know, I'm Yeah, I'm feeling I'm Yeah, I'm just feeling very sick. That's probably because I'm feeling dizzy. My room is kind of spinning. And I can't I can't walk properly. Well, I can walk properly, but not straight. And my ears are buzzing a bit. I'm just feeling a bit off. off. Okay, he's buzzing. So when did it all start? Started probably about two hours ago, maybe, but I I had a similar sort of thing about a month ago, but I didn't really think anything of it because it settled quite quickly. This has been going on for a bit more now. Okay, so you said you mentioned it started a few hours ago. So when did it start? What were you doing? I was actually making my husband some breakfast and I, yeah, I just suddenly felt very fuzzy and dizzy and a bit sick. Okay, so you mentioned it's like the room spinning around? Yeah. Okay, and is how long does it last for? Or is it there now continuously? Yeah, it's it's there the whole time. So it's there now for the past two hours, you'd say, yeah? Yeah. Okay, did you have any kind of viral illness in the recent past, past couple of weeks? No cold cough, nothing. No, I've been pretty healthy, I think. Yeah. Yeah, okay. You mentioned that you have some ear buzzing kind of kind of thing? Any kind of ear pain or ear discharge, anything like that? No, nothing. Okay. Do you have a temperature at all? I don't think so. Okay. Right. You also mentioned that you can walk but you're not walking straight. Why is that? Is it because I think just because the room feels like it's moving a bit. It feels like the room. That's why you feel like you're a bit unsteady, yeah? My legs and arms and everything are working fine. I just I don't feel like I'm stable. The room is spinning. So there's no weakness of your arms and legs, okay. Okay. Right. So you mentioned you had something like this a month ago. So how long did that episode last? Probably only about five, ten minutes. Okay, right. And do you have any hearing problems at the moment? Like, is it muffled or something? It's just a little bit of a buzzing noise in my ears, but otherwise I can hear everything. Okay. Right to you. Okay. So have you been physically sick? No, but I am feeling very sick. Nausea, okay. Right here. And I don't have much information about your past medical history. So, is there any medical conditions you'd like to tell me, surgical medical conditions? I've had premature ovarian failure and I've taken HRT. Okay, HRT and premature ovarian failure. Okay, and any other medications at all? No. Okay, do you have any allergies at all? No. Okay, right. Okay, so talking to you today in the most common, you know, diagnosis we would feel you're suffering from at the moment is something called labyrinthitis. Yeah. Okay, that's when your middle ear, there's some inflammation going on there and there's some imbalances in the crystals there in your middle ear. Okay, so what the most important treatment is actually giving you some kind of middle ear sedative so that you won't feel like you're going around in a boat, kind of feeling. Okay, so that's what we need to start because to actually make you able to function a bit more, we'll start using certain medications. I would still like you to be seen by one of our doctors to take a look inside your ears to just make sure. So this is like just symptomatic relief. Like if you have a fever, we just give paracetamol. So just to make you able to come and see one of the doctors and things like that. While you're with the doctors, we'd like to do your blood pressure, just examine your, you know, how you're walking and everything. Okay. While we're waiting, while you're waiting on seeing the doctor, if you develop any weakness of your legs or arms or, you know, a sudden headache, any of those symptoms or you start being violently sick with it, then you know you would need to take your dog to A and E. But if not, wait for the appointment, wait for the doctor to examine you, and we'll take it from there. So I'll send a prescription across to your pharmacy. It looks like it's the Lloyd pharmacy on our system, is that correct? Yes. So we'll send you across that prescription. It's called Semital. It's one tablet three times a day. So I'll give it for about ten days worth. In the interim, obviously in the next few days, you'll get to see one of my doctors and we'll have to take it from there. Okay, thank you so much. Any questions at all? Do you need to take those tablets with food or can you just take them any time? It doesn't really matter. You can take it because sometimes you know you get the symptoms as soon as you wake up so probably you'll feel a little sick to eat anything so we might as well just take the tablets. Okay, that's great. Thank you so much. That's so helpful. Just make sure you call support to book that appointment. Okay? I will. Thank you very much. Goodbye now. Bye.
