Hello? Hello? Hi, can you hear me? I can hear you. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you now. Excellent. Just before I go any further, can you confirm your name and your age, please? Oh, yeah, my name is Jessica Smith and I'm nineteen years old. Okay, and how can I help you, misses Smith? Um, yeah, so, uh, I mean, this is this is a bit embarrassing, but it's kind of, uh, hurting when I when I use the toilet when I pee and, um, it's been going on for a few days, so I'm a little worried about it. I'm not sure what to do. Right, well, thank you for coming. in. Hopefully we can help with your symptoms. As you mentioned, it started a few days ago. So can you tell me a bit more about what kind of pain it is that you're experiencing? It's not too bad. It's kind of like a stinging kind of pain. It's not like unbearable, but it's definitely it definitely bothers me my feet. And yeah, I also maybe sometimes get some like pain kind of lower down in my stomach when I go to the bathroom. Okay. Yeah. And the pain in your stomach is it can describe the pain to me? Is it cramping, burning, sharp? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe sort of cramping. I'm not really sure. But it's not like it's not like cramping like when I get when I have a period or something. It's like, I don't know. Okay. Okay. Fine. And have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal? No, I don't think so. I haven't noticed it. No. Okay. Fine. Have you noticed any funny color to your urine? So has it been any blood in your urine or have you noticed any other darkening of your urine? There was a little bit of blood earlier today, but other than that, not at all. No. It does kind of, it kind of like, doesn't smell very, it smells a bit weird, I guess, but no, not really anything, nothing drastic. Okay, fine, okay. Right, let me just write a few notes down as well. Fine, and you mentioned the tummy pain that also started a few days ago. Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards the back or towards your flank, the sides? No, not really, no. No, okay, fine. Were there symptoms? Have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Uh, no, not, not at all. Okay, any fevers or temperatures? Sorry, any fevers or temperatures? Sorry, I didn't hear you. No, no fever. No fever, okay, fine, sorry. Um, okay, um, in terms of your bowels, are your bowels working okay? Um, I think so, yeah. Any, any diarrhea, l loose stol? No, not that I've noticed at all. Okay, all right. And Jessica, sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions just to get a full history. Hope you don't mind me asking, are you currently sexually active? Yeah, I am. Okay, and is that with a regular partner? Yeah, so I've had a boyfriend for about a couple months now, yeah. Fine, okay. Have you noticed any other discharge from below? I haven't noticed anything. No, okay. When was your last, um, last STD screen, if ever? I don't think I've ever had one. Okay, fine. Um, and do you use any form of contraception at all? Uh, yeah, we use condoms. We use condoms, okay. And when was your last period? A couple of weeks ago. A couple of weeks ago, okay. Is there any chance you could be pregnant, perhaps? Say again? Is there any chance you could be preg pregnant? I don't think so. It's always worth asking young females like yourself. So if that obviously, if you are worried about the pain not getting any better, then I would always advise you to do a pregnancy test to rule that pregnancy. Okay. Fine. So just moving on, moving on. Are you otherwise feeling well? Yeah, I think I'm feeling okay otherwise, yeah. And so by that I mean, do you have any other medical problems, medical history? So in the past I'veve had some IBS, but other than that, I think no serious medical problems that seem, yeah. Okay. Do you take any regular medications? No. I did a little bit ago or a couple of days ago, try some overcounter bicarbonate to try and help with the pain, but it wasn't, it wasn't really helping. Okay. So you tried that and it didn't help. Okay. All right. Do you have any allergies to any medications? Yeah. I'm allergic to clindamycin. And what happens when you take clindamycin? I get some like a swelling, basically. Swelling, it seems like a pretty severe allergy to it, is that right? Okay. Yeah. Fine. In terms of your family history, is there anything I should be aware of related to kidneys, bladder, bowels, gut? No, I don't think so. Not that I, not anything I know about. Okay, all right. And tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's living, who's at home with you? So I live in a flat near my college with a couple like friends of mine. So I'm not like living at home or anything. Okay. And what do you say? That's what you're asking about, sorry. Okay. And are you working at the Moon or are you a student? I'm a student. Okay. And what are you studying? I'm studying biology. And how's that going? It's good, yeah. It's really, it's really interesting learning about how the world works. Yeah. Great. Do you have any aspirations for the future in terms of careers? I don't know. Maybe a doctor one day. You never know. I recommend it. We need doctors. What about smoking and alcohol? Do you drink much in the way of do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? I don't, I don't drink, I do drink like on weekends. So socially, okay. All right. Right, excellent. So at this age I would proceed to examination, but based on your story, just to summarize really, so the last three days you've been having a bit of burning pain when passing urine, a bit of crampy, tammy pain lower down, essentially, but no other fevers or back pain, if I understand correctly., I think you probably do have what we call a simple UTI or a urinary tract infection, a black infection, which can be readily treated. So I'll give you a course of antibiotics today. Something called either nitrofurantoin or trimethoprin, and it's normally a three day course. So one tablet twice a day for three days, and that should hopefully help your symptoms. But I also advise you to drink a lot of fluids. Let's try and flush that infection out of your body if you still not feel better by the end of this week, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me and we can have another look at your symptoms. Okay, so three days of the medication and then wait a little bit. If it still doesn't go away, call back. Yeah, absolutely. And things to look out for would be, you know, if you're having kind of high temperatures, a back pain, just generally feeling more and well, you know, I do want you to give me a call back because then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up to your kidneys, which is something we want to avoid. So do give me a call if you have any concerns. Okay. Okay. Is there something like, should I be worried about like not having sex or anything within the next week or anything like this? I mean, if you can try and avoid it, I think that would be sensible. It's great at using barrier conception. I recommend you to continue using barrier conception. But if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up, that will probably be the best for you and your boyfriend. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. Great. Okay. Thank you so much. No risks. Wish you all the best. Yeah. Thank you. Take care of yourself.
