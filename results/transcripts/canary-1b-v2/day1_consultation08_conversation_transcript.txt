Okay. Oh, I can. Hello. Hello, Tini Honey. Hello. Just before we go any further, can I confirm your name and age, please? My name is Isa and I'm 26. 26. Okay. And how can I help you this afternoon? So basically, I've been really stressed at work for the past few days and I've realized that I've got really dry, itchy skin. Okay. Sorry to hear, work has been so stressful. Tell me more about your skin first, Liu. Tell me, you mentioned it's been dry and itchy. Where about in your skin?? All over my arms and my hands, mainly. Okay. And is this something you've had before? I know. Never had that. So did it, did it come about quite suddenly or was it more kind of a gradual thing? I think it started a few days ago. Okay. And has it spread anywhere else? Has it spread to your, to your chest, your legs, your face? No. Okay. So apart from being dry and itchy, any other symptoms? Has it been sore? Has it been, have you noticed any cracked skin? is quite red and I'm using coconut butter for the past few days. Okay. Has that helped? I don't have any spots. Okay. No fever, please. And I'm not sweating either. Thank you for mentioning all those. Okay. So the coconut butter hasn't helped with the itch? No. Okay. And you mentioned work has been quite stressful. What do you do for work? I work as a teacher. Okay. And in what way has work been stressful? I think the kids have been really annoying these days. Okay, well, I've been working really long hours. Okay, all right, well, I'm sorry to hear that and I hope it gets better. Going back to your skin, is there anything you've done perhaps, which may have triggered your symptoms, anything you've touched or, you know, for example, shower gel, soaps, fabric cleaner? I went swimming a few days ago. Okay, is that the first time in your life or have you been before? No, I've been before. Okay, and did your symptoms start after you went swimming? Yes, did. Okay. That's good. Okay, all right. You mentioned you've had no other fevers, is that right? No fevers, no vomiting? No. No. How's your health otherwise? It's pretty good, yeah. I'm not on any medication. Okay, well, we'll get to medication just a second. Do you feel genuinely run down? Do you feel tired? Yeah, I think I have been quite tired. Okay. Okay. Are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, I've been drinking and eating as normal. Your appetite's fine, is it okay? And your bowels, are your bowels working okay? Yeah. No, no problems with vomiting or loose doors. No. Okay. And your waterworks are all okay, your plastic urine okay? Yeah. Okay, all right. So just moving on, in terms of your other medical history, is there anything else I should be aware of? I'm currently taking MicroGym. Microgynon? Yeah. Okay, do you know what that is? Uh, no. Okay, it's a contraceptive pill. Okay. Does that make sense? Is that something you, is that, does that ring a bell now? Oh, yeah. Okay. Are there any other medications you take? Oh, no. No. So in terms of your medication, there's no problems of skin problems in the past, things like eczema or dermatitis? No, I think it might just be the weather. Sorry, what was that? You think it's I think it might just be the weather? The weather? Yeah. Oh, you think the weather? Okay, you think the weather? Okay. No, it's okay, no problems. We'll move on. And do you suffer from allergies? Are you someone who suffers from allergies? Food allergies, medication allergies. I think I'm lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerant, okay. That could be helpful to know. Fine. In terms of family history, is there anything in the family that you're aware of? Yeah. So my dad has asthma and my mom has hay fever. Hay fever? Yeah. Okay. Fine. But any, again, any skin problems I should be aware of? Uh, no. No. Okay. All right. Socially, who do you live with at all? Can I ask, do you smoke? Are you a smoker? No, I don't smoke. Do you drink much in the world of alcohol? No. Recreational drugs? No. Okay. And you said you worked as a primary school teacher. Yes, that's right. The reason I'm asking is sometimes stress can be a contributing factor. You felt you noticed yourself finding life has been more stressful recently. Okay. Do you think that might have any correlation to your symptoms? I mean, I don't think so. Okay, well normally at this stage I'd like to proceed to examination, but based on your story, it's difficult. I think you know, you essentially the story is you've got a dry, juicy rash on your, maybe your hands you mentioned, and your arms, which started, perhaps, after swimming a few days ago. But no other symptoms you're feeling otherwise well, no fevers, no bleeding or excrement from the skin. I wonder if you may have something called dermatitis. Have you heard of that condition before? I have, yes. Okay. Well, I can give you a patient information leaflet about that which gives a bit more information about the disease, but it's something that we can readily treat with a couple of options. We have steroid creams I can give you which will help with inflammation and something called emollients which can help with the dry, dry skin. And that's something you just need to kind of paste on your skin throughout the day for the next few days. And hopefully that helps your symptoms. Okay, cool. Thank you very much. You can also try antihistamines. So you can get things over the counter, Puritin., luratidine that can sometimes help with the yiciness. Yeah, that sounds good. Okay, and that's probably why I recommend Paracetamol in this occasion wouldn't be helpful. Painlasting wouldn't be helpful in this occasion, but let's see how the next few days go. And if you're still not getting better, come back and see me next week and we can have another look at your symptoms. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Rick, do you have any questions for me? Uh, no. Okay, well, I wish you all the best. Have a good day. Well, thank you very much. Thank you.
