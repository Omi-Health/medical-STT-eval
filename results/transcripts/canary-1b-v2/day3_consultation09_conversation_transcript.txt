Hi. Hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. So, just before we start, is it okay if you could confirm your name for me, please? Sure, my name is Mary Smith. And your date of birth? My date of birth is august 16, 1976. And your email address for me, please? My email address is Mary.Smith at gmail.com That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Absolutely. Right. So you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw, is that correct? Well, I think that's just like the first thing that I typed, but it wasn't really what I, you know, I just typed it and then I clicked submit, so that was a, I mean, it's part of the problem, but I would say that more of a problem for me is that I can't quite move my left arm. I mean, I can move it, but it's, it's, it's numb, and then I also feel some, like, tingling in my fingertips. Okay. Okay, so numbness in the left arm, yeah? Yes. How long has it been going on for? So I've started taking this boxing class. I've been taking boxing class for a few weeks and I feel like maybe it's probably been, I'd say for at least two weeks and it's kind of gotten worse. Like at the beginning I just kind of felt a little bit of tingling and then it's gotten, it's gotten worse since then the numbing kind of started. I can feel it both in my, you know, a little bit in my elbow and then in my arm. as well as in my hand. And so now because it hasn't gotten better, I tried to get a massage. It's not better. Or, you know, I tried to take a warm bath. It's not better. So I figured I'd call you and just figure out what's going on. Right. So, have you mentioned a massage and a warm bath? Any medications that you've taken so far? Well, it's, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's My muscles were sore, uh, a little bit. And I've been taking this boxing class. So, you know, I kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand. So that's been a little bit painful. So I've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that. Okay. But like I said, I mean, I tried massage, I tried some hot bats, and that didn't help with this numbness thing. Sure. I'm just kind of getting a little worried. Of course. And also from you just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards. Is that, you know, the tingling numbness is elbow below, not from your shoulder.? Well, it's kind of funny. You know, sometimes I feel it in my shoulder. Like if I try to, if I try to, like, move like in boxing and stuff, I will even like, maybe feel a little bit of pain. But I would say if I'm just like resting, if I'm sitting like right now, I can feel like it's numb and I actually feel tingling right now. Not in all of my fingers, just in some. Yeah. So which fingers do you feel numb? Okay. So it's my second, third and fourth finger. Second, third and fourth finger. And is it your palm side or, you know, the back of your hand side which is numb or both? No, it's it's this side. So the front side. It's the front side. Okay. Right. And have you been dropping things at all? Like, you know, when you try to hold on to things like a glass or something, have you been dropping it? So not so much with the glass, but I will say, well, I play a little bit of a piano and so I just noticed that it's been kind of harder to get the notes. I can I can grasp I can grab a glass, but because I use my right hand most of the time, you know, I'm not left handed, so it's kind of hard for me to So you would say there's a mild weakness, mild Yes. So just to get my facts right, so you would say it's definitely weakness rather than because of the pain you can't hold it. There's two different things. So you know, sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you. No, no, it's not hurting. It's not hurting. It's like numb. I can feel it, right? Okay. Yeah. Fine. So you have definitely having some sort of some form of weakness. Okay. Any neck pain at all? No, not no neck pain. No neck pain at all. Okay, right. Okay. So just a little bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system. Do you have any past or medical history that you'd like to share? Well, I guess because of this, you know, I'm not sure if it's boxing. I also had a really bad cold like a month ago. I mean, I was out, you know, drinking with friends. One of our colleagues just had his three year anniversary. And we kinda went crazy and we were like out partying until, you know, late hours and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me. And then after that I was sick for probably good like two weeks, I was at home. I think I must have had some kind of like a flu or something. So that and then I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago is like I all of a sudden just couldn't see from the, uh, from my left eye. Like I lost some, like a little bit of a field of vision. And but that just didn't last very long. I mean, that just lasted maybe for., I don't know, twenty, twenty minutes. And I kind of thought, I don't know, maybe it was the, the cold, you know, and the virus and all that. So I guess that's what I can, you know, that's the last thing I can remember. But in general, I'm pretty healthy. I mean, I, you know, I work out a lot and I don't really have any medical problems. Do you have any headaches at all from the in the recent past? Sometimes I get headaches, but I think they're just tired headaches. You know, sometimes I'll get kind of tired, but I think that's probably because I work too much or, you know, because, like, I'llll go for a workout and then I'll really just exhaust myself and then I just kind of feel this fatigue. Or sometimes, like this morning, for example, I just felt really fatigued and I couldn't even get myself to the gym. But, you know, since I have this numbness, it's kind of like hard to work out, right? Do you wear glasses at all? Do you have glasses, contact lenses? No. No, so no glasses. Right. And you haven't had experienced anything like a seizure, a fit, anything like that. What is a seizure? Like when you shake, you lose consciousness and you start shaking. Oh, no, no, no, no, not like that. No fits. Yeah. Okay. And your weakness is only in your left arm. So, legs for walking and all this normal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Walking is normal. Yeah. You mentioned for a while you couldn't see, you know, the outside peripheral vision from your left eye. How long did that episode last for? You know, I think it was only maybe like twenty minutes or so. It's almost like it happened. And I thought, oh my God, it's probably I'm still like sick from this, you know, virus thing, cold. And so I just kinda slept it off. And then when I woke up it was gone. Sure. Okay. Okay. So are there any regular medications that you're using? Not really. I just take ibuprofen every now and then. I take vitamin D. I take some, I like my GP really wants me to take iron supplements. But they're this huge bill. So I most of the time I just forget. But vitamin D I take. And then sometimes I take melatonin to help me sleep. Okay. All right. And any family history you'd like to share? Any significant family history? I know that my dad has, I don't know if it's hypo, I think it's hypothyreosis. Yeah. And then my, like, he's got he's got some autoimmune stuff going on, like, that much I know. And then my mom, my mom, she's she's actually not in a great shape. She's got diabetes type 2. She's got hypertension. She's got gosh. Gosh, what is it? Oh yeah, she's got high cholesterol and I think that's it for her. Yeah. Right. Any neurological conditions in the family? Nerve related conditions. No. Okay, that's one. Okay, so, yeah. So after, you know, speaking and examining, you know, yourself on this, I think it's quite important that we investigate it a bit further. I'm just wondering if there's something a bit more than just the boxing here. Okay. A few things that's made me think other than just like a boxing injury is, for instance, you know, when you said you can't, your vision went, peripheral vision was not there for about twenty. So, and that with the weakness of the arms make me think, is there something else going on rather than just the injury? What do you think maybe going on? Sometimes, you know, you do get things like MS, multiple sclerosis. So people with multiple sclerosis can have visual problems like what you've experienced and sometimes you know the odd numbness tingling sensations going on. Okay. Oh my God. Will I be in wheelchair? If we catch it a bit early, there are treatments for it. Okay. I'm not obviously I'm not suggesting that you do have it, but it is quite important to find out whether you have it or not. That's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be dealt with here. Yeah? Okay. So what we can do is I'm going to do an urgent, very urgent neurology referral. Yeah. What they what that might entail is the brain scan and things like that. Hello. I see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm here. I'm here. I know this might sound a bit of a shock to you, but I think it is important that we investigate this a bit more seriously. Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. Okay. Any questions at all? Well, what's okay. So you're going to do the referral. So should I be taking any drugs or? No, that's something we can't do. The treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that when you have an acute, you know, acute reaction or things like that. But saying that first we need to adopt a firm diagnosis. Yeah. Now while you're waiting for this to be done, if there's any weakness, you know, if the weakness progresses to your legs or there's any kind of headaches, vomiting, fits and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better, then that would be an AME. Okay, got it. Okay, thank you, doctor. Yeah, I'm sorry, I appreciate you are a little worried, but you know, it's good that we know that you've come and spoken to us today and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling. Okay? Thank you, doctor. Appreciate your time. That's okay. You take care of us. Bye bye. Bye bye now.
