Hello, can you hear me okay? Oh yes, I can. Can you hear me? Yeah, good, good. So my name is Joe. I'm a doctor here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? Hello, my name is Vincent. And your date of birth? Uh, ninth of may 2016. Okay, great. And are you in a safe place, oh sorry, a safe and confidential place to talk and just say, you know, I'm am. Great. So how can I help? Yeah, so I have a call that I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week and it's been causing me problems. I've had to stay away from work for about three or four of those days because of how bad it is. Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week. And what came first? The sore throat came first and then after a day or two the cough. Okay, okay. And are you coughing up anything? No, it's very dry. Okay. Okay, so I'm just going to ask a few questions about your current symptoms and then a little bit about your background and something else about what we can do a little bit later on in the consultation to help you. But before I go on, is there anything you're particularly concerned about or have any ideas what might be going on? You said you had a cold. Well, I mean, you know how we all are. Once this happens, you google it and it seems to be all kinds of bad things. It could be, it could be a cold or flu, obviously, but it could also be tuberculosis, it could be cancer, it always comes up. So it would be good if none of those. Right, so yeah, I can provide a little bit of reassurance and we can talk about those a little bit as well. And was there anything you particularly expected or hoped to get out of this consultation? Well, yeah, so reassurance, so like hopefully some sense that it's not anything serious, but also if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better or any advice or maybe even a sick note so that if I need to stay away from work for a little bit longer I can get one. Sure, sure. Okay, all right, so we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms and I'm sure we can get a googled. Those things, some reassurance about your concerns. So you mentioned that you started with sore throat about a week ago, developed into a bit of a dry cough. I'll just ask a few questions around those. So, do you have any shortness of breath? Yes, yes, I've been having shortness of breath. You are short of breath. And do you have any whiess or chest pain? A little bit of a cough. You're feeling a little whiessy with some chest pain as well. And how at when did you start to develop a shortness of breath? Let's see. So the sore throat, so today is Friday. Sore throat was about last week Friday or Thursday. Cough was Saturday. So the sore throat was the thing shortly after the cough, so maybe a day or two later. So three, four days ago. Three or four days ago you started developing shortness of breath. And is the cough worse at night? No, it's the same throughout the day. Same throughout the day. And when you say you're short of breath, just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are. So, are you able to, so, like, walk up a flight of stairs, for example, or are you short of breath and rest? Oh, yeah. It's like when I'm doing walking and I do exercise now and then. So it hasn't been super bad, like it hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual and I'm a little worried. And you're a little concerned about that. Okay. So, I just need to ask a few things about your background as well. So, do you have any other medical conditions or medical history? No, no past medical history now. No past medical history. No history of asthma? No. And any history of clots on your legs or your lungs? So these are these and these or these. No one in your family has had those clots on the legs or lungs. Well, my mother had lung cancer. Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke? No. Have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos? You know? Don't know with asbestos. I've ever smoked. I mean, once or twice in Amsterdam with black arts, but not really. And this just going back to your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough, it's a dry cough, no, you're not coughing, you have no pH. Do you do you have and you say you don't have any chest pain as such, are you taking any medications currently? No, I'm not. Okay. Are you allergic to any medications? Not to any medication, but I'm allergic to peanuts. Peanuts, okay. You mentioned that your mother had lung cancer. Any other family history of any significant illnesses running in your family? No, no, that's the only one, just lung cancer from my mother. Just lung cancer. Okay. And you say you have a cold, so do you have sinus congestion or No, it seems to be almost entirely with just my throat, like my nose is spinning out. Just your throat and any recent travel or have you always lived in the UK? Uh, no, so I I haven't always lived in the UK. Like, so I was born in the US and moved over about twelve years ago, but in terms of recent travel just to Europe, no too exotic. Okay, so no, no recent travel, no significant recent travel anywhere. Um, okay, and are you coughing up anything other than, um, so you're not coughing up blood or anything like that? No, no. Um, good. And, uh, are you feverish, hot, cold, sweaty? Yeah, so a little bit feverish, um, at first. So the first three or so days of this, but then the fever's gone away. Okay. And in general, do you have a sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I was just going to say also had a bit of a headache. Like headaches that come and go or other, but like right now, it's fine. Okay. And in general, would you say you're feeling you're you're starting to feel better, worse or sort of staying same? So it's like it's up and down. So, let's see. So I started last week and I stayed home from work two days this week. I think it was maybe Tuesday and then Thursday. So like I felt better and then worse again and then better and then worse again. So it's been kind of a constant but constant in being variable, if that makes sense. Okay. And I just need to ask any other kind of risk factors that you may have. So, no sort of significant weight loss or unexplained weight loss. Any waters? So, no weight loss, but I have been, I have been losing my appetite recently. And I mean, I usually eat a lot, so I don't know, I enjoy eating as well, but like, that's been a bit concerning. You've been losing your appetite recently. Yes. And you're a little bit concerned bit worried about that. But you haven't you haven't lost any weight that you think of. No, not that. And any sort of rashes or anything? Any? No, no rashes. No, you can't go. Okay. So I would ask to examine you now, but I I don't know if I could look inside your throat at least to see if there's a probably Oh, we can try it. Oh, no. Well, no, it's okay. I'm sure I might think about doing that. Have you any lumps or bumps around your neck that you can feel? Uh, no. Not a lot? Not the no. Okay. And so finally you were talking about, I mean, it sounds to me that you've been a little bit up and down, sore throat, developed a dry cough. You are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of the consultation now is if you feel significantly worse, if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathiness or breathiness that you are concerned about, then I would advise you to seek medical attention again, see a GP. And actually see someone physically. But I think for now I can kind of try and reassure you that if this clears up as I expect it would, so expect this to kind of be getting better in the next four or five days. If it's not, please get in touch with the medical professional again. And I would expect it too. And so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis. Your concerns about lung cancer were that the other thing you were concerned about? Yeah. Yeah. Again, if you're not getting better, please see someone again. I've just got four seconds now, so nice talking to you and we've got to tidy up. Yeah. Okay, so and I'll provide you with a synote just to give you a few more days off work and paracetamol, lots of fluids and rest up. And as I say, if you're not feeling better, please get in touch. Okay? Okay, thank you. Have a good day. Thank you.
