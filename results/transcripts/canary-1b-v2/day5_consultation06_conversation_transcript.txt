And when when when were you last sick? I was sick just after trying trying to have breakfast this morning, so maybe about two hours ago. Okay, and have you been passing water okay? Yeah, I've been I've been yeah urinating okay, is that what you mean? Like yeah, yeah, urinating, yeah. Any and what sort of color is the urine? To be honest, I didn't know how to look so I really couldn't say. Okay, and when did you last pass the urine, do you think? Um, at least an hour ago. Okay. And any blood in the stol or in the urine that you've noticed? No blood. Okay. Any episodes like this before? How are your bowels normally? Sorry, I didn't catch that. How are your bowels normally? My bowels are normally fine. I would normally go to the toilet every day. Episodes of diarrhea or constipation normally? No. And is there anything you think might have triggered this off? Have you been abroad anywhere? No, but then my brother has actually been having similar symptoms for the past few days as well. And he does say like everyone is coscotting. So I don't know, that might be from him. So you've been in contact with him, have you? Yes. Okay. And any other medical problems? No, that I'm not. Have you had any other symptoms at the moment, like rash? No, no rash, no, nothing bad. Okay. Any surgery before or abdominal problems or any other medical issues? Well, apart from the fact that this one is giving me abdominal pain, no previous abdominal pain before. Also, I get the odd, you know, menstrual cramps and all that, but, you know, that's, you know, that comes and goes. Okay, and where is the pain that you're getting? It's kind of like, towards my navel area, like I can't touch my navel area, it's just so sore and it gets, yeah, towards like the center of my navel. And does the pain come and go? Yes, it does come. When it comes, I feel the strong urge to go to the loop and then sort of releases me and sort of like comes again. It comes and goes. Okay. And do you take any medication regularly? Well, I take my vitamins, I call vitamin D. Okay. Every day. That's about, that's about all that I regularly take. And do you have a normal diet? Yeah, I've got to, I eat well, normally. Right. Do you smoke or drink alcohol? Well, I don't smoke, but you know, I have a pint from time to time. And do you take any other drugs? No, like I said, I only take vitamins. For my menstrual comes, when it comes, maybe I might take an ibuprofen just to lighten the pain. And when was your last period? Two weeks ago. Okay. Are you on any contraception? No. Are you having regular sexual intercourse? No. Okay. And what's your job? I'm a graphics designer. Have you had to miss work because of this problem? Well, yes, I've had to actually work from home today. I'm working from home today because I can't I can't be out for work. Okay. That's missed. And who do you live with at home? I live with my brother and my mom. Okay. Okay. And have you tried anything yourself for this problem? Well, I've tried a home remedy. I've tried the ORS, you know, thing I bought from my local, my local. Can you just repeat that? The ORS, the salt sugar ORS mix, the salt sugar mix. Okay. And how often have you been taking that? I've taken that I've taken that like three times a day for the past two days. Okay. And do you feel like your symptoms are easing off or getting worse or to be honest, I I they're not getting any better because like I said I've been I've been vomiting literally everything I take so I doubt that even that has had the chance to work. Okay. I mean it sounds like because your brother's had a similar thing, it sounds like it might be some infectious gastroenteritis that you've got, which is usually caused by a virus but it can be from something you've eaten as well. If the symptoms they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts. If the symptoms are continuing to get worse, the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough. Sometimes you do require certain medication to help this if it's sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria. What I would say probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not starting to ease off, I think it's probably important to get a scalp of the stool so we can make sure. that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment. Okay. And we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated because if you're if you're not keeping fluid down then you can get dehydrated. So how do I how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even like drink water? I'm throwing off everything. Yeah, so you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago. So you obviously still. hydrated enough to pass urine but we we should see you so that we can check your hydration and get that sample sent off as soon as possible because if if you come into the clinic you can send that sample off right away otherwise we would have to post it out to you which would take time okay so when can I come to the clinic to have this done so we can we can make you an urgent appointment and then you can you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration but if in the meantime you're feeling more unwell, then we would get you seen urgently in A and E. Okay. So you could call us back in the meantime. Okay. So what I'll do, yeah, if you could, please book me the appointment and then yeah, I'll see how I feel before the end of the day. Hopefully I don't need to go to A and E. And keep drinking, keep going with the rehydration salt, just tiny sips constantly to so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and you vomit. So just tiny, tiny sips, but just keep going with it. And just have very simple food if you're going to have anything like toast or biscuit or something really light like that. Avoid fruit, vegetables, milk, anything like that which might just make it worse. Okay. Okay. So you'll have to book an appointment through the support line. Yes, please. Right. Okay. We'll do that for you. Okay. Take care. Thanks. Thanks. Bye.
