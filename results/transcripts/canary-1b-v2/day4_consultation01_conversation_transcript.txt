Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Yeah, I can, can you hear me? I can. Hi, my name is Dr. Gohill. I'm one of the physicians that works at Babylon. Are you in a quiet and private space to talk? I am, yes. Good. And can I confirm your name and date of birth, please? It's Joe Blogg's, it's the 7th of June 1974. and how old does that make you? Sorry, 54. Perfect. I'm supposedly 53. Great. And it says here, it says you're having chest discomfort. Is that correct? That is correct, yes. I'm experiencing some discomfort in my chest. Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort when it started and how you're feeling at the moment? Sure. It's been going on for a couple of hours now. I'll tell you that it's gone quite suddenly. I was digging in the garden and if I had to describe where it is, it's somewhere in the in the middle of my chest. And it's more, it feels more like a pressure, the discomfort than more than a pain. If I had to describe what that discomfort feeling is, it's like someone sitting on my chest. Okay. Yeah, great. So you've talked about your chest. Are you still in discomfort at the moment? Yes, as you see. Okay. And when it started, how would you rate it out of ten?. Okay. Ten being very unbearable and severe pain. Seven is quite manageable, but it's quite discomforting. Okay, and what about now? It's still the same. Okay, and tell me before this happened, what were you doing? I was relaxing with my wife and we're watching Jeremy Kyle. Okay. Still gardens the garden. Okay, and how often do you do gardening? Every two weeks, so every two weeks. Okay, and are you normally fit and well, so are you normally okay to garden as you would? Yes. Great, and apart from this, do you have any other medical problems? High cholesterol and I've had hypertension, not all have hypertension. Okay, so that's high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Do you take any medicines for that? No, I don't take any medicines. Okay. Okay, and are you allergic to anything? S three. Okay, so let me summarize what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago and you experienced chest discomfort, which was roughly seven out of ten. It feels more like someone sitting on your chest, as opposed to pain. Yes, that's great. And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual, specifically with your breathing? Yes, I have. I have shortness of breath. I feel slightly lightheaded. Okay, and is it getting worse or better? It's remained the same, although I'll say recently I've noticed in terms of sort of breathing I've had some difficulty climbing the stairs and if I have to kind of walk uphill, there's that sort of challenge as well. And when you get short of breath when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain? No pain as such, but there's often calf pain and leg swellings. Okay, so let me confirm you have the pressure at the moment and you have shortness of breath, is that correct? That is correct, yes. So given what you've told me about your past medical history, I think it might be worth it you call an ambulance to get you to the hospital as soon as possible because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart. So while we talk to you, I will call an ambulance who should come to your address. But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone so I can gather some more information that we can give to the paramedics. Is that okay? Should I be concerned about anything? It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol and you've got some chest pain, I'm always worried about the heart first before anything else. Again, make sure we need to take care of your heart before anything else. So apart from this ache-headedness and this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else unusual? Nothing else. I'm not sure if I spoke to you about nausea. I've noticed nausea, but no vomiting. Have you had anything to eat or drink this morning? No. And do you still feel nauseous at the moment? I have, yes, I am, yes. So I have a couple of other questions to ask you and I'm going to reel them off. So apologies for not letting you talk too much. No, that's fine. Have you noticed this pressure radiating to your head? Not to my head, no. And what about your left or right arm? Yes, there is some pain in my left shoulder anal. And does that pain go anywhere else, to your left arm or to your back? Uh, no. And have you noticed any problems swallowing or drinking water? Uh, no. Good. And have you noticed any problems going to the loo? Uh, no problems going to the loo. And you're normally fit and well apart from the two things you told me about? Um, yes, however, there are some problems just performing daily activities. Um, like I said with the day-to-day. With the difficulties climbing up stairs and going uphill, I try to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house, nothing to stress. And do you live at home with your wife at the moment? Uh, yes. Okay. I would suggest if she's there, you let her know that you'll be having an adventure to the hospital today. So she might need to get your things together. Gotta go. The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm and have some water if you need. Don't take any of those medications. The paramedics should be with you very soon. So when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about. Okay. So one is your chest, so your heart, and the second is your breathing, which is your lungs. Okay. So they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate. So don't be worried. Okay. And when you get to the hospital, you'll be seen by a consultant pretty, pretty much immediately. Yeah. That's right. Resturing and calming. Sure. I will let the paramedics do their job and when you're at the hospital, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how everything's going. Oh, that's great. Great. I'll book another appointment to see you soon at the clinic once you've had your adventure. That's perfect. Thank you so much. No problems. Do you have any questions for me? No questions. I'll just wait the ambulance. Great. Thank you very much. No problems. I'll speak to you soon. Thank you very much. Bye. Okay.
