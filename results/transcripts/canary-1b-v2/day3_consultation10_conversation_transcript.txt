Hello, hello, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. So just before we start, is it okay if you could confirm your name for me please? Michael Jonathan and your date of birth? 092983 Okay, and your address for me please? 231 Leonard London Street or sorry London Okay, and that's correct and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Yes. Okay. You've mentioned in our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea. I'm sorry to hear about it. So if you tell me a bit more about it, please. It's been happening for about three days now. Okay. Yeah. It started off was, I don't know, it's just something that I thought would go away pretty quickly. I've had that from time to time after eating certain types of food or going on certain travels. But nothing funky in my diet or no travels recently. And it just kind of kept up. I'm a bit confused as to what to do. So you haven't had anything from outside, nothing dodgy, anything but no. No, no, no. Just a little bit, yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's pretty standard diarrhea where there's like a little bit of abdominal pain. I threw up once. That was a little worrying. Can you repeat that piece that wasn't clear? What did you say? I threw up. Once, huh? After that, we said something. Uh, nothing else was worrying. Okay, right. And with the diarrhea, how many times a day are you going to the toilet? Uh, four to five. Four to five times, yeah. And is there any and it's like water? Is it like water or is it just loose? Uh, what do you mean? Are you going like water or is it just, you know, a bit bit of solid juice, a bit loose kind of thing? It probably depends on the time of day, to be honest. A bit of both. A bit of both. And is there any blood or mucus? No blood. What do you mean by mucus? It's like snoty stuff. In the stool? Yeah. It looks like snot. Do you No. No. So no mucus. Okay. Any fever at all? Uh, maybe a little bit. But it hasn't been that in particular hasn't been too worrying. Are you still able to eat and drink? A little bit of appetite loss, I guess, versus the normal. Okay. But also not something I've, like, if that was alone, I wouldn't have shopped. So, but you're still able to drink a good bit, yeah? You're drinking plenty. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Excellent. Mostly to try and rid. Okay. And what have you taken? Have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea? Nothing yet. Nothing yet. Okay. Okay, anything for the abdominal pain? Uh, nothing yet. Okay, right. And any, unfortunately, we don't have any of your past medical history. Is there something you'd like to say? Uh, I probably had asthma before or I don't know. I guess I still have it. Okay, and are you anything else other than asthma? Uh, my dad had hypertension. Okay Yeah. Hypertension. Yeah, he died of bowel cancer ten years ago. Oh, dear, okay, bowel cancer, ten years ago. And how old was he when he died? 62. Okay, and you mentioned you had asthma, are you using any inhalers at all? Yes. Which ones? LexiPro. Sorry. LexiPro. LexiPro. Yes. Okay, not heard of it. Maybe. Is it like salbutamol? Is it like a blue color? Yellow. Yellow, okay. I'll have to check that one, not sure. Like seed proof. Okay. Bass, find any other medication that you're using over the counter, anything at all? Red, no. Okay. Right? Any allergies? Nothing. Yeah, nothing. No allergies at all. Right, dear. So obviously you know you just have diarrhea is about four to five times a day. You're still drinking a lot and you look like you're not dehydrated, which is a good sign. Okay? When we stop worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day, that means probably you are, you know, whatever you're eating is going straight through. Okay? You still need to drink a lot of water because you're losing a lot of fluids. Okay? When you go to the toilet. The things that one would advise is a soft diet. So avoid dairy, fish, meat, eggs while you're having a diarrhea. Sorry? What is a soft diet? What does that mean? Like, outside of not those things. What do you mean by soft? Okay, so that will be like crackers, toast, jam, those kinds of things that's easily digestible. Like what we would give babies. Yeah. When they start eating, you give simple food for babies. You don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding. So that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about. Yeah. Once you are able to keep most of it in, you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mashed. Once you're okay with that for about 48 hours, then you can start having meat. So just don't have meat immediately once you feel like you're slightly better, because you might go back to square one again. Okay. Are you okay with that diet? Like once 48 hours you're not having any diarrhea, you're fine. Then you can go and start having meat, egg, fish and all that. So that's when your diarrhea is getting better but isn't getting or do you want it to go completely at that point? Or if it's like trending up? No, no, no. You preferably just don't because why do we say this? This is because it takes much more time for meat to get digested. So because your gut flora, the bacteria in your gut is not as it should be, it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these foods while it doesn't take that much of an effort to digest mash and vegetables. Does that make sense? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, so at the same time you could have some, although you can't milk is not a good idea, yoghurts are a good idea because they are probiotics. It helps to build up the normal gut bacteria back. Okay, so those kinds Now things to look out for if your diarrhea doesn't go away in a week's time or if you're passing blood, we need a stool sample because that means you may have some some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics. Okay. Okay. If you're again, as I've mentioned previously, if you're going about six to eight times a day, that means there's a high chance that you are having dehydration and you might need to go to hospital at that point in time. If that happens, you get in touch with us again. Okay. Okay. Any questions? You look a bit confused. Now that's it. Yeah. Okay. And also you could get something called Dyrolite over the counter so it helps to replenish the salt that you've been that's lost through going to the toilet. Okay. If you're a bit confused, you know, you can actually all this is all recorded in your app so you can go back. I'll put that all in detail so if you know, I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything, you can go back and read the notes. Is that okay? That's great. All right then. Take care. Bye. Bye now. Bye.
