Hi there, it's Dr. Smith from Babylon. Can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address, please? I can't hear you at the moment actually. Could you turn up the volume up? That's better. Thank you. Okay, sorry about that. Are you in a private place where you can have a consultation? Yes. What can I do for you today? I've been having this blinding headache for a few days and it's really bothering me. I find it very hard to focus or I can't even go to work. Okay. And any headaches in the past before this? Not really, just they're on and off. I recently had one for like two days, but it just went away with ibuprofen. So nothing like for longer than two days before. So how did this start? It just started all of a sudden. I woke up one morning with a headache and that was three days ago and I just keep having it. It doesn't really go away with alpha gofrein either. I try that, but it just it gets a little bit better, but it doesn't go away. Okay, and where about in your head is the pain? It's kind of all over, but I feel like over my right eye it's a bit stronger. Okay, any problems with your vision or any problems with tolerating the light? Lights definitely make me more sensitive. Like, I don't really like strong light. And, yeah, vision, I think I get this shooting light lights sometimes. I'm not sure how to explain it, just a little bit of a weird kind of vision. Okay, and any any nausea or vomiting? No, feeling a bit sick or no vomiting. Any tingling or numbness or weakness anywhere? No. Any change in your smell or taste? No, not at all. And in the past when you've had headaches, whatches, just a bit of a pressure in between my eyes, but nothing major. Okay. And with this, has it been there all the time or is it coming and going? Kind of all the time. So when I take off the drop and it gets a bit better, so it's a bit like less. It bothers me less, but then I still have it, it's still there. And what would you say the severity is if ten is the worst pain you've ever had and zero is nothing, what would you say the pain is like? I guess it's mostly. eight and then it comes down to maybe a five. Okay, and what about at night? Can you fall asleep? Yeah, I'm sleeping well. Is it waking you up at night? No, no, no. But I can wake up with it in the morning. Okay, and you're worse when you change position or bend over or cough or anything like that? Sometimes when I stand up quickly I get a bit of a stabbing pain or if I turn my head like I kind of feel like something is moving inside. Okay. And have you had any eye checks recently? Yeah, I actually had one recently and nothing changed in my vision. Okay, and have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears or pain over the sinuses? Any cough or flag? No, it's not bad. Any, any nose bleeds or cough, any blood or anything? No. And just recently, have you been well or have you had any general problems, any change in your weight or tiredness, lack of energy, anything like that? No change of weight, maybe lack of energy, but maybe because I'm just having this headache. So I find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities, but, you know, when you have this constant headache. Have you been at work recently? I work from home, but couldn't really manage to do it all the time. So sometimes I just do the day off. So you've been, you've had a headache over three days. How many days have you missed off work? So I work from home all these three days. And the first day I work from home and then the second day I just took the whole day off. And today I just tried to work from home the first half of the day, but I just stopped in the morning. because I couldn't focus. Okay. And any other medical problems in the past? I think I only had a permanent pain when I was younger, but no cause was found and that went away, but that's the only thing I know about. Okay. Have you been abroad recently at all? No. Do you take any medications? Just a bill. Which one? Marcellonne. And when did you start that? About a year ago. Any side effects with that? Uh, no, I don't think so. Have you noticed any, any increased frequency of headaches since you started that? Um, no, because this headache is just very recent, so nothing, uh, four years ago, but nothing really changes. Okay, and when you've had when you've had when you described your headaches in the past, you said they were just general, did you have any visual symptoms, flashlight? No. Nausea, vomiting with them? No, nothing. Have you had your blood pressure checked recently with your pill? Um, yeah, I had a choice in the pharmacy when I got the pill and they said it was normal. And when was that? About a year ago. Okay. And any allergies to anything? No. And who do you live with at home? Sorry. Who do you live with at home? Just myself. Okay. And do you smoke? No. Do you drink any alcohol regularly? Yeah. How much in a normal week do you think? Um, probably like three beers once a week. Okay. And do you take any other drugs at all? No, apart from the epidurphin attack sometimes and the headache gets really bad. So, I mean, it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache and you said you've had some altered light in front of your eyes as well, but you haven't had a high temperature. Have you checked your temperature? No, I didn't. I don't really feel feverish or anything. Okay. I mean, it could possibly be a migraine type headache, but in fact it's still going on for three days. we probably should book you for an appointment to get an examination. Obviously, if it settles in the meantime, then we can cancel that, but we should do a neurological examination and look at the back of your eyes as well. Okay. In terms of medication, I can prescribe you something similar to ibuprofen but a bit stronger, which you can take instead of ibuprofen, and you can also take paracetamol at the same time. Okay. So if you're happy to book an appointment with us with the support line for us to do a full examination and start the medication which I prescribed to you take it with food. If you're you said that when you go to bed your headache is okay and not waking you up at night. Yeah, it's not. But you mentioned migraine and that reminded me that my mom suffers from like she has migraines. Okay. Any other family history of medical problems? Um, no, I think that's it. But I know that my mom like she has quite bad migraines. She's like, has the vomiting and everything. Okay, that's fine. Um, I mean, if in the meantime, before your appointment, your headache is becoming unbearable, getting worse or changing, then call. Then call if it's that bad then you should go to A and E and have an examination. You can call us for further advice on that. Okay. When you have an examination with us, we'll check your blood pressure as well just to make sure your pill is still appropriate for you because sometimes if we think it's a migraine then you would have to change your pill if you've had these flashing lights and things like that. Is there anything in the pill that can cause it or is it? Well, some pill so that pill if you're having regular migraines with flashing lights or other symptoms, it wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill particularly. We'd have to change it to something else. Okay. But you can continue with that for the moment. Okay. Have you got any other questions? So would you like, um, send me a referral to a specialist or to conduct a Yeah, you book an appointment with the support team then we can do a full examination then. Okay, perfect. All right then. Take care. Thank you very much.
