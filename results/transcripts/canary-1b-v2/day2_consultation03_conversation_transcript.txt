Hello? Hi there, good morning. Hi. I'm Dr. Ding Nigel from Gupier Ha, nice to see you. Nice to see you. Hello. So before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth, if that's okay? Uh, yeah, uh, Mary Richards, uh, and my I'm 40 years old, so. You're really okay fine. So you're 40 years old, he said, yeah? Perfect, okay. Um, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yeah. Okay, great. Um, so how can I help you today? Um, so I've been having some, um, problems. I can't really hear very well and I notice that my face has been feeling a bit numb recently. Right, okay. Okay, and how long has this been going on? It's been a few weeks now, about three weeks or something. Right, okay. And is this just on one side or both sides of your face? Just one side, just on my left side. I've noticed that the hearing has kind of gone down a bit. Right, okay. And your face feeling numb, where exactly is that? Which part of your face? Can you show me with your finger? Yeah, so again, it's the left side. It's kind of like around my left ear and kind of. along here, so like my jawlines, just all being a bit numb around here. Right, okay, okay. Has anything else happened in this time? Any other symptoms you've had at all? Not that I have I've noticed. I just occasionally notice like ringing in my ear. Some ringing in your ear, okay. That's, you know, part of it. Sure, okay. And have you had any weakness or numbness in the rest of the body at all? No, no, no, nothing like that. Okay. Have you had any difficulties with swallowing? No. And have you had any difficulties speaking? No, no. Have you noticed any problems with your vision at all? No, that's all good. Okay. And do you have the numbness present right now? Yeah, it's kind of there quite often, quite often, so yeah, right now it feels very, it doesn't feel like when I touch this side of my face. Sure, sure, okay. Just going back to the kind of muffled hearing feeling in the ear, do you have any discharge coming from that ear at all? No, nothing coming out. Any pain in the ear or from the ear? Uh, no. Right, okay. And, um, have you had any fever at all? No, nothing like that. And do you, um, have any, uh, jeans in the ears? No. Do you use cocktail buds to kind of clean your ears out? I don't. Oh, no, no, no. Don't use cocktail buds like that. Okay, all right. Um, I just need to ask a few other general questions. Um, do you have any other illnesses at all? Um, I've, well, I've got kind of been told I had polyps in my nose in the past and occasionally get some kind of half burning feeling. See you then? That's all fine. And, you know, I take a Reneeve if I need to. And if my nose polyps are playing up, I've got a spray. Other than that, I think they said, Ages ago, I had something called, I can't quite remember, but labyrinthitis, something like that. But again, nothing, nothing on the ground. Sure, okay. So, are you on any regular medication? You mentioned the spray for your nose. Yeah, so no, I only take the spray for my nose when I need it for and sometimes take over like Reneeve, but I just get that from the chemist. Sure. And the spray for your nose, where do you get that from? Is that from a doctor? Yeah, they gave me a prescription ages ago. Yeah. Do you remember the name of the spray at all? I don't know the name of the spray at all. Unfortunately, I don't. Sorry. That's all right. That's great. And you don't take any other medication at all. No. No, okay. Do you have any allergies to any medication? No, just latex. Latex. Okay. All right. That's good to know. And in terms of your family, are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all? My brother had neurofibromatosis, I think it is. Right. And other than that, everyone else is okay. Okay. Good. That's good to hear. And in terms of your own kind of background now, are you working at the moment? Yeah. So I'm a I'm a jockey, but because of all the kinds of symptoms I'm getting, especially sometimes when I get a ringing, I can feel a little dizzy. I've just had to do far less training. So kind of beginning to impact the work a little bit now. Okay, so you have to excuse vagrants. You mean, jockey like with horses, is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Oh, right, okay, fine. Great. And do you live alone? I live with my partner. Okay, right. Do you have any pets at all at home? No, no pets. Okay, fine, fantastic. All right. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what'ss been going on recently? No, just like, like, I said, like the ringing, um, occasionally, and when I get that, I can sometimes feel a little dizzy, but the main thing is really this lack of hearing and the numbness that's got me up the side. Just, yeah, no idea what's going on there. Okay, fine, all right. Um, so what I think, go on. There was just like there was one thing I think, just because I can panic and you can look online and get a little frenetic. I guess what I'm trying to think is, you know, is there something particularly serious that, you know, will need to be sorted and obviously reading anything can make you. really panicked and is it basically nothing so serious I would die from it? I don't know. I just I think I'll be okay. So obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via a video portal. But from what you've told me, this doesn't seem to be like anything that you're going to die from. However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today. Okay? I'd like you to come into one of my clinics. I'd like a GP to assess you. What you're describing might be something called Bell's paralysis. Okay. We can go into that, explaining what that is. That is, if that's confirmed on a physical examination. That's not usually a life threatening problem. But part of the reason why I'd like you to come in is just that we can do what we call a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on and confirm whether that might be the diagnosis. Have a look inside the ear, see if there's anything to see inside the ear. So in response to your question, no, I don't think that you need to worry about that. I think preliminarily I can reassure you. However, in order to definitively reassure you, I think you need a physical examination today. Okay? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to send a message to our admin team. I'll ask them to book you for a face to face appointment in one of our clinics in central London. Okay, and then you can call the support team number. I'll leave that number in your notes. You can call them after five minutes and then they'll slot you into a place that's convenient for you. Okay? That's fine. Okay, so someone will see you and hopefully we'll be able to reassure you further, but please make sure the appointment gets done today. Okay, yes, they will do it. That's fine. Thank you very much. Okay, then, okay, nice to see you. Take care. Bye.
