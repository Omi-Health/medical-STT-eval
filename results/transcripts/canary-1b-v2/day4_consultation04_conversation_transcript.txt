Hi. Hi. Hi, how are you? Yeah, I'm all right, thanks. Although she's feeling a little weezy. Okay, my name is Dr. Gemma. I'm one of the patients that worked in Babylon. Can I confirm your name and date of birth, please? Yeah, my name is Tina Smith and I'm 40 years old. Okay, and are you in a space that's quiet and private? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm just in my room. And you mentioned that you're weezy. Mm hmm. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Yeah, so it started like about two days ago. I don't know if it's because I was cleaning the house and like all this dust came out of the carpet and I've always thought that maybe you've got an allergy to like dust or something. So I don't know if it was triggered by that. Two days later, still not going any better. So I'm just getting a little worried about it now. Okay, so you were cleaning the house two days ago and that's when it first started? Yeah, that's right. Did the whizzing start suddenly or was it gradual? So it started after maybe an hour or so And has it got worse over the past two days? Yeah, so it gets a bit worse at night I find. Okay. And have you taken anything for the whizz? No, no, I haven't actually. Okay, so and the whiz has been getting worse and today you're particularly worried. Is it because you're finding it hard to breathe or finding it hard to talk? Yeah, yeah, a bit of both actually. So, I'm feeling like a little bit short of breath. Okay. And actually when I'm, you know, talking to my friends and stuff, finding that sometimes I'm unable to complete my sentences. Okay. It can get really bad, yeah. And when you can breathe and you take a deep breath, do you notice any pain? Um, no, no pain. Okay, and have you noticed yourself feeling dizzy or the rim spinning more than normal? Uh, no, no dizzyness, uh, nothing of that. Okay, and have you been eating and drinking okay, particularly water? Yeah, yeah, I think I'm having like, you know, four or five glasses a day. Okay, and are you normally fit and well or do you have any other medical problems? Um, well, actually, I used to have like a bit of, um, asthma as a child and also in the summer. I sometimes get hay fever. And when you get hay fever, do you take medications for it? Not really. Okay. And your asthma, did it resolve when you were a child? I think mostly, yeah. I mean, sometimes when I run for long periods it can start up a bit, but I have an asthma inhaler used for that. Okay. So do you still have your inhalers? I think I might have one from like a couple of months ago. Okay. But you don't see your doctor regularly for asthma? No, I don't. Okay. And apart from this, do you know if you're allergic to anything? Uh, not that I know of. Okay. And how far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment? Sorry, could you repeat that? How far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment? Uh. Uh, so maybe 5 minutes drive away. Okay, good. So, given that you've had a history of asthma when you were a child and you get hay fever sometimes in the summer, your shortness of breath Hi, I've lost, um, video signal. Can you still hear me? Um, yeah, we've just turned off. Have it. So, given you've got a history of asthma and hay fever, this could be one of two things. But we want to rule out asthma or an allergy first. So what you'd need is visit one of our clinics so we can do some more tests. So the first thing we would do is use a small device on your finger to check the amount of oxygen in your blood. Okay. And from that we can tell if it's asthma or something else. Right. Okay. Before this happens, if you've got something like an antihistaminic which you normally take for hey fever at home, I would take one just in case it's an allergy you've had from the dust. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah, I don't have any antihistamines at home unfortunately. You might be able to get one on your way to the doctor's surgery. If not, they can prescribe one. Okay, okay. So can I just get it over the counter then? Yes, and they're normally about four to six pounds. Great. Is there anything else that you're particularly worried about or want to ask me? Um, not really. I mean, I have before taken steroids for asthma. I don't know if that's relevant. Yes, that is, and you may need to take some steroids now, but we can't we won't be able to know until we've done those tests first. So I'm going to write a letter for your GP just to let him know what's happened and the consultation with the GP in person shouldn't take too long. Okay, how long do you think it will take? Probably ten minutes. Okay, that's great. Cool. You should get the letter over the app and then we can take you yourself to the GP. Okay. Cool. Thank you very much. Okay, bye. Okay, thank you. Bye bye.
