There's no good leaves. Hi. Hello. Hi there. Hello there. Thanks for being here. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Yes, it's Adriana Katrin Gieva, and I'm 26 years old. Okay. Adriana, how can I help you this afternoon? Well, I have this like really crazy headache that's been going on for a few days and it really annoys me. Oh, dear. Okay. When exactly did I start this headache? Around three days ago, maybe. Three days ago, okay. Okay, and where about in your head is this pain? It's basically like it kind of feels all over my head, but like mainly around my right eye. Okay, and is a headache there all the time or does it come and go? It's it kind of comes and goes, but I mean it is there all the time, but like sometimes it's stronger. Okay, so it comes and goes. Okay, and if I were to ask you on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst type of pain you ever had, how would you rate this headache? It's probably a eight. If I were to ask you to describe the headache to me in terms of the nature of the pain, is it sharp? Is it dull? Is it crampy? Is it throbbing? It's kind of it's dull but sometimes it gets a bit sharper. So basically it developed gradually, I guess. It's like the first day it just started when I was at work and by the end of the day it was like pretty pretty like it was a lot basically and then I was thinking okay maybe I'll just go to sleep and then I woke up the next morning like it was even worse basically. So you think the headache is getting worse in the last three days? Yeah. Okay. Have you tried anything which has made the headache better? So I tried ibuprofen. So I took like a few for the last two days basically. That helps. But it doesn't really help. No. In the past it did help me, which is why I decided to try it. Okay. All right. Except the headaches, any other symptoms at all? So for example, any problems with your sight or your vision? Not really, but just when it started I got this like. This like weird shooting lights and like now like light is quite annoying my eyes. So when you say annoying, does it hurt to look at bright lights? Yeah, yeah, it hurts. So, okay. And have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision? Not loss of vision, I wouldn't say. It's just like some lights from shooting lights, basically. Okay. Any nausea or any vomiting? Well, I'm like basically I'm sick with the headache, but I no vomiting. When you say sick, you mean you feel sick, okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, no vomiting. Okay. Any neck pain or neck stiffness? No. Okay. And any difficulty with speaking or speech? No. Any difficulty with weakness in your arms and legs? No. It's hard to focus though. So I had to take a couple of days off work actually. Oh really? Okay. Okay. No problem. Well, I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on. Any recent head injuries at all? No. Okay. And have you had anything like this before in the past? Have you ever had it before in the past? Yeah, I mean, headaches, you mean? Or similar to this kind of headache, isn't it? Yeah, I mean, I had, but usually after I take ibuprofen, it kind of goes away. So, but this time it's just not. It's not okay. All right. Any temperatures or fevers? No. Any rashes at all on your skin? No, not at all, I've noticed. Okay, and just moving forward, are you otherwise fit and well, Adriana? Am I what, sorry? Are you fit and well? Do you have any other medical history? of migraines at all? Not myself, I've never had a migraine, but my sister and my mom have them quite frequently. Okay, fine, I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask, do you take any regular medication? No. Are you on the pill? No. Okay, do you have any allergies to any medications? Not that I know of. Okay, so you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines. Yeah. Is that normally well controlled or are they having difficulty controlling the symptoms? So my sister's like better, like it's kind of very rare, but my mom's is like quite bad. Usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that, it's yeah, it takes her out for a few days basically. Okay, fine. Socially, tell me a bit more about your life outside of work. So who lives at home with you? I live with housemaids, so three of them. So we're a four. Excellent. And are you working at the moment? You mentioned this impact on your work. Yeah, so I work well, I work in IT, so I work with computers. a lot, so it's kind of difficult to focus. I had to like reduce the brightness of my screen. Okay. Do you wear glasses? Yes, I do. Have you had any recent eye check done eye test? No, I've been wearing them since I was five years old. Okay. Something to keep in mind if you feel like your eyes are straining. I would always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Have you been feeling more stressed or anxious at work recently? Well, it's been a bit stressful starting off a new a new project, but yeah, nothing out of the ordinary really. Okay, all right, great. Regarding smoking or alcohol, do you drink or smoke at all? I socially smoke and I drink not only socially. Only socially. Okay. Right now, Adriana, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Have you read anything online or talked to people? Not really. At first I thought it was stress or maybe I didn't drink enough water because sometimes when I don't drink enough water I get headaches. But I don't think that's it. And I'm like worried. I don't want it to be a migraine because I know what it's like from my mom and my sister and it's really annoying. So I really don't want to have that. And I know it's genetic. So I've researched that. But I don't know if that's the case. So yeah. Is there anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today? Yeah, maybe just kind of if you have any recommendations of I can take something stronger because apparently ibuprofen doesn't help me. Usually it gets resolved if I have a headache and like after like one or two days, but currently it didn't help me. How many tablets did you take of ibuprofen? Three a day. Three a day. Okay, all right. So Adriana, so really what I think is going on here, I unfortunately I do think this could be a headache very similar to a migraine. The reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it given your mom and your sister also had migraines. I think it's something for us to think about. Now I'm not saying it's going to keep happening, but it may just be a one-off, but it's certainly worth treating it today with some stronger analgesia or painkillers. Now moving forward, we have some options which we can discuss. You try the ibuprofen. Now my only worry is I'm not sure if you're taking the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets three times a day. Oh, right. So there's definitely room for improvement there. Or I can prescribe you something stronger like naproxen, which is another anti inflammatory which can be helpful. We can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or wh codeine, which might be helpful as well? Mm. Yeah. I think codeine is what my mom takes for when she has migraines. Okay. I think it's definitely worth looking into, so I can give you a prescription for that today. With regard to the next few days, it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try to figure out what's, you know, if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse. And, you know, like you come back and see me in about a week's time, a week to two weeks' time. If you are having more frequent episodes of this type of headaches, we can think about giving you medicationations as prophylactic, which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis. But we can have that discussion next time. Okay. In the meantime, if your headaches are not getting any better or they're getting worse, you know, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner, okay? Okay. If you have any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs or you're just not feeling very well, just give me a call and come back and see me. Okay. All right. Great. Great. We'll have a good day. Thank you too. Bye.
