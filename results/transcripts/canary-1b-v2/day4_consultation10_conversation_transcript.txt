My name is Lizzy Irvine, 23 July 1995. Great, thank you, Lizzy. And are you in a confidential and comfortable space to talk? Yeah, especially on a Friday. How can I help? Yeah, just for the last couple of days I've been feeling really sick in my lower tummy and I've had a bit of a temperature, so feeling quite like hot and sweaty and it's jagging, really uncomfortable. Okay, so you've been feeling nauseous and you've had some pain in your lower tummy or you say you've been feeling sick in your lower tummy? Yeah, it's more of a ache. So like a ache in my lower tummy. Okay. And then I think it's feeling hot, sweaty, sometimes I think it's sickness, but yeah, a bit of a ache. Okay. So if it's feeling hot, sweaty, unwell for three days, feeling sick, nausea, with a ache in your lower tummy, any actual vomiting? So yeah, no, just nauseous, no vomiting yet, luckily. And it's only been for a couple of days, but yeah. two days yeah okay and uh any problems with your waterworks or diarrhea no so I'm I'm going to the loo a little bit more often than usual I drink a lot of water but it does feel like more often yeah like nothing too out of the ordinary um and I was I was a little bit like um I don't know, constipated, I guess. About a week ago, by May K now. Okay. So you've been constipated a week ago, things are you having regular bow motions now? You said you had a bit of diarrhea, a bit of watery, did you say? No, it was more like I was just a little bummed up and then about a week ago that kind of cleared and I'm normal now. Okay. And you're saying you're going saying you're going, you're drinking a lot of water, you're going to the toilet more frequently for a wee, is that? Yes, yeah, I'd say so. I tend to drink a lot of water anyway, but I feel like I'm going to the toilet more often. Hmm. Any pain when you passed urine? Um, no, no pain. No stinging? Uh, no, just it seems normal, yeah. Okay. And, um, and sort of no foul smelling urine or anything like that. Um, no, nothing, nothing I can think of. No. You're having, you're saying you're going a bit more frequently, are you having to go with urgency to the toilet for we? No, there's no urgency. Um, yeah, no pain or urgency, just yeah, being quite frequently, but it's all seeming normal. Yeah, I probably wouldn't have thought of it being linked, but yeah. Okay. Okay, so the main symptom is feeling sick with this, you've been feeling bunged up and this, this sort of pain in your tummy. Just to ask a few more questions about the pain in your tummy, is it how would you describe the pain? It's yeah, it's like below my belly button. It's aching kind of more like a, I guess, like a dull ache just below the belly button, kind of, yeah, here. And is it constant or is it coming and going? It's, yeah, it's feeling pretty constant over the last couple of days. And I just need to ask a few questions about your periods and stuff. Any chance you could be pregnant at the moment? Um, I don't know. Um, probably not. I don't think so. I'm very careful. Sexually active at the moment. Yes. Yeah. And um, you mentioned about periods. I did notice a bit of um, I don't know. It's like, not necessarily like spotting, but in like in my, my P is like a little I suppose I think I thought it was my period it's like a little pink. In your P, did you say? So your P is slightly red or slightly pink? Yeah. But I am kind of like due on my I didn't know if that was like yeah, part of it. Okay, so when was your last menstrual period? Around a month ago, yeah, three and a three and a bit weeks ago. Okay, so it's great. And did you say you're sexually active, you're using contraception? I've got the arm, the implants and one sexual partner, a regular boyfriend. So just to go back to your symptom of constipation, can I just clarify when was the last time you had a bow motion? Yesterday. Okay, and do you feel like you are still quite bugged up at the moment?? No, it seems to have cleared up. So I was about a week ago, but I'm okay. Okay now, the last few days. Yeah, it's been okay. Okay. All right. So you just to kind of confirm your symptoms, you're feeling sort of sick, nauseous, with tummy pain, which is fairly constant. How did the tummy pain come on suddenly or gradually? It's only been for the last two days. So I guess, yeah, quite recently. So it's it's come on gradually, is it? Yeah. Not a sudden onset. Okay, and your last menstrual period was just three and a bit weeks ago, and but you say you've had some, a little bit of spotting possibly before in between periods or recently? Yeah, the last kind of week or so, yeah, the last couple of days really, but because I was due on, yeah, I think., yeah, just the last couple of days. Okay, but you're expecting your period soon. Yes, yeah. Sure. Okay, and just to ask a few questions, do you have any other medical problems that I need to be aware of? I'm allergic to moxicillin. Allergic to moxicillin, but no other medical problems that you No, not that I'm aware of any drug allergies? Oh, you mentioned the moxicillin, but anything else? No, that's it. And do you take any medications at the moment? No, no medications, but I'm on the implants, I think it's called Implanon. Implanon, yeah, sure. Okay. Do you smoke? No. Okay, and do you live alone? with your partner? With my boyfriend. With your boyfriend. And any other medical, sorry, any diseases running your running your family? Not any that's brought to mind in my immediate family. My brother is a type 1 diabetic. Okay. Great. So is there anything that you want're particularly concerned about with this sort of nausea and the constipation? I don't know, it's just a really, like, a really horrible ache. And I have a nauseous, hot, sweaty feeling. I'm not really sure why, yeah, why it's happening. But for the last couple of days, that's probably all that's getting comfortable. Yeah. Anything that you had hoped particularly to get out of having this consultation? Anything? Sorry? Was there anything that you had hoped to get out of having this specific consultation other than a diagnosis and getting better and, you know, being on the right track to feel better? Yeah, no, that's kind of I just want to go back to normal, yeah. But a bit more comfortable. Yeah, sure, sure. Okay. So, and then finally, I didn't ask you, do you have any discharge or anything like that from below? No, no, no discharge. No discharge. Okay. All right. So I think this could be a few different things. It could just be simple constipation. You mentioned that you were bugged up but you did go yesterday. So it's and your bowel habits that you've been going regularly but you did mention that you were bugged up. But there could be a few other things going on. I would quite like to see. see you to do some further to do an examination and to do some tests as well. We need to definitely rule out pregnancy with you and possibly do some other examinations or sort of further tests. So would you be happy to actually see a GP face to face soon? Today ideally? Yes, yeah. Yeah. I can make time. Are you and you're feeling hot and sweaty. Have you been feeling? Lightheaded at all or like you're going to faint? No, no, not like I'm going to faint. Okay, all right, well we're just kind of tying up, running out of time a little bit, but I'd really like to see you for some more examination and investigations. If in the meantime, between now and me or a GP seeing you, you feel worse in any way, you get layheaded, you have you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you, then I think take a them quite seriously and see someone more urgently if possible. Okay, is that, was there anything else that you want to talk about right now? I'm glad we've got the ball rolling with this and we can sort of see you again to take this a little bit further. Okay? Yeah, thank you. Really appreciate that. Okay. All right, thanks for your time. Cool. Okay. Cheers. Thanks. Bye.
