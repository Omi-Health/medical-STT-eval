Hello? Hello. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your date of birth? Uh, yeah. My name is April and I'm fifty. You're fifty, okay. April, how can I help you this afternoon? Well, I've just been having this, like, cough for quite a few days and my nose is running. Um, it's just been super annoying and it's not going away. Oh, I do. Okay. When did it all start? Uh, I think it started like, maybe a little bit less than a week ago, like, maybe, maybe five or six days ago. Okay. And you mentioned a couple of things there. You mentioned a cough. You mentioned a bit of a runny nose, is that right? Yeah. Okay. Let's focus on your cough first. Can you tell me a bit more about your cough? It's just so continuous. It's really, really frustrating. It's quite dry and it's just all day. It keeps me up at night as well, which is really annoying. Okay. So it's a dry cough. So you don't bring up any, you don't bring up any, oh, I can hear that. Yeah. You don't bring up any mucky flem or anything like that. No. Okay. So it keeps you up at night. You mentioned the cold symptoms as well, the runny nose. Do you have a sore throat at all? I mean, apart from, I mean, the coughing is giving me a a sore throat, but it's not like, you know, not more than that. You know, just my throat is irritated from coughing, but it's not like it's not that bad when I swallow or anything. Right. Givenny, how are your ears? Your ears feel blocked? No, they feel okay actually. Yeah. No pain or discharge from your ears. No pain, no pain on the ears. Okay, all right. Fine. In terms of your breathing, how's your breath, how's your chest? Is your breathing more laboured? I don't think so. Like, I guess like it's labored when I'm coughing and I can't breathe, but like, not yeah, I don't think you feel like when you walk around you don't feel breath out, do you? I don't feel breath out. No, I feel, you know, generally tired. Okay, okay. Yeah, but not, not anything special with my chest. Any pain in your chest? No, not, not that either. Okay. You mentioned feeling tired. Have you felt feverish at all? Have you got a temperature? I've been having like shivers even when I'm in, when I'm in bed. You know, like when you when you go to sleep and you feel like I should be warm, but but I'm still, still, you know, shivering a little. So I haven't measured my temperature, so I'm not one hundred percent sure if I had a fever, but it feels like I probably had, because I was just I was next to my boyfriend and he was completely warm and totally fine and I just, like, couldn't stop shivering. We kept adding more sweaters and I was still cold. I do, okay, okay, all right. Fine. And in terms of any other symptoms, have you had any nausea? Have you had any vomiting? No, no, no nausea, no vomiting, but yeah, nothing like that. How's your appetite? I mean, it's okay. Okay, I at the beginning, like when I was starting to have the symptoms, the coughing and stuff, I had a little bit of diarrhea, but it didn't it didn't cut my appetite or anything. I just like my stomach wasn't feeling great. Okay, has it got better now, the diarrhea? Yeah, yeah, it got better. It was only like the first, like it started at the same time as the cough started and then it stopped. So I thought everything would be fine. But then the coughs just stopped going. Okay, fine. Any problems with your water works at all? With my work? Your water works, your urine.? Oh, no, no, no, that's fine. You passing urine okay? You're drinking a lot of fluids and passing urine okay? No, I drank a lot of water when I started having the diarrhea. Now that stopped, I just went back to normal. Okay, all right. In terms of anything else, did you notice any funny skin rashes or problems with your muscles or joints? Like my, you know, when I had when I was telling you I had like the I had chills and I was really cold. My muscle was really hurt. Okay. I'm trying to do Pilates, but like it's hurting me so much at the moment. Right. But to be honest, all I feel like doing is. just lying in bed. Right, okay, okay. Sorry, that must be very difficult for you. Yeah, I'm not great. Especially like in my arms, my legs, like just everywhere basically. Or getting quite lethargic and weak, mentioned. Yeah, pretty much. Okay, and April, are you normally otherwise fit and well? I'm normally what? Fit and well. So, do you have any other medical history? Well, I have type 2 diabetes. Okay. I have quite high blood pressure. Okay, and what do you take for your blood pressure? Any medications you take on a regular basis, should I say? I take metformin for diabetes. Yeah. And I take lithinophryl for high blood pressure. Lithinophryl, okay, fine. Any allergies at all to medication? No allergies. No, okay. Regarding any family history, is there anything I should be aware of? My dad also has type 2 diabetes, but I think that's it. Okay, all right. Who's taking care of your diabetes? Is there anyone? Do you have a doctor in hospital who takes care of your diabetes? I just regularly go see a doctor and just check it up. Same with the high blood pressure. Like I have it under control. And since I've started taking this medication, I've just been like regularly checking that it's under control. Right, excellent. In terms of your social situation, who lives at home with you? Just it's just me and my partner. It's okay, fine. Is your partner well at the moment? Yeah, he has nothing of this. Like he's just going ahead like nothing. Like I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him, but right, okay. Not diarrhea, nothing. He's fine. Oh wait, he's got away with it at the moment. Okay. And are you working at the moment, April? Yeah, I am working. But the first day, I skipped because I was feeling just too shit. Yeah. And then I just felt like I had to go back because I had so much to do. I've been going in, but it's not been fun. No, I can imagine. What is it that you do for work? I am a developer. So you work in your IT field. Okay. Yeah, work in IT field. Right, okay. It's not too active a job. No, it's been quite stressful week for me. Not more than usual. I don't think it's related to stress. Like, I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work at the moment. Really, I'm going to take a day off to try and recover. So yeah, I don't think think I did. So the reason I ask is sometimes stress can really affect your immune system. But it's good to know you're not feeling stressed. Do you smoke at all, April? I used to, but I've stopped for about six months now. Okay. And what about alcohol? I mean, yeah, I don't think I drink that much. I don't really know how you count the units, but I guess I don't drink more than, say, three evenings a week, and I rarely get properly drunk or anything. And what is it that you drink? Wine, mostly. And wine? And how much did you drink on those nights? I'd say like maybe two or three glasses. Okay, so yeah, so you're probably just about under the limit of the recommended limit. Something maybe to think about just because of your blood pressure and diabetes, maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can. Yeah. Do you think I should cut down on that? Really, ideally, the right answer is to cut down completely, but in practice, I know that's not realistic. So maybe for the first few weeks, why don't you cut down to two glasses a week and then one week thereafter?. And if you're coping okay, then we can maybe try and cut down altogether. Okay. Okay. Just something for you to think about. Right. So just as we wrap up really, April, I think based on your story, I think essentially, I think you're going through a bit of a viral illness. I don't think there's anything to worry about. You know, you've had a bit of a cough, a bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic. I'm hoping that, you know, you're probably over the worst of it now. It's been five days. I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better in the next couple of days. Normally it lasts about a week to ten days. What? What should I do if it just keeps going on? and on, like if it's still going on in, say, four days. Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to, you know, get some good, good rest, drink a lot of fluids, keep yourself well hydrated. You can take regular paracetamol. If you feel like it's still looking better in two to three days, it's probably worth coming back to see me again, we can check you over. And if you are still feeling feverish and your cough is not getting better, then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest, which can sometimes be a common source of infection. Do you think I should keep going to work or do you think I should just Yeah, so I think, you know, really, I think it depends on you. If you are coughing, then there's a theatrical risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still. So I would say maybe take a day or two free from work if you can and get some good bed rest and maybe think about work early next week. Okay, okay. But if your cough isn't getting better or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner, okay? Okay, but otherwise I don't need to worry. No, no, nothing to worry about otherwise. Okay, all right, thank you very much. Have a good day, appreciate it. Thank you, bye.
