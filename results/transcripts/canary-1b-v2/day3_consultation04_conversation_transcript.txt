Hi Hi, I'm Dr. Jacob, welcome to Babylon. Hi. So just before we start, is it okay if you could confirm your name for me please? Yes, so my name is Richard and your date of birth? 14 June 1996. And your address for me please? And twenty eight Ritz Road SW 1910. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Thank you. Okay, so you mentioned in our notes that you've got some tightness. If you could tell me a bit more about it, please. Yeah, so about two to three days ago I was running with a friend and usually I could talk to her while I was running, but I found myself actually short of breath. I'm not really short of breath when I'm walking, but definitely if I'm walking briskly now. And I've used my blue inhaler, but to no avail. It hasn't really helped me. So I'm having I'm just whizzing a bit and coughing and just generally a bit short of breath. Whizzing and coughing, okay. And you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler, so how often are you using it the blue inhaler? I think I'm just using that as and when I have symptoms. Yeah. So at the moment you are having shortness of breath. So are you using it every day at the moment? Yeah. And morning and evening to kind of prevent it as well. Okay. And what what what color? What's the name of your preventer? It's a blue. I think in totality my history of selbutamol, clenil, cetroben and hydrocorpine that I'm taking as well. Okay. So could you repeat that? Your selbutamol, clenil. Cetroben and hydrocortison. And hydrocortison. So you have eczema also, yeah? What's that, sorry? You do have a history of eczema. My brother is asthmatic and my sister has eczema and I've got a few issues that I think could be eczema as well. Okay, right. So coming back to your, you know, your shortness of breath, you've mentioned you're weezy and you're coughing. Are you bringing up any phlegm at all? No, I don't. I'm not coughing up much because I sputter. Okay, no sputter. Okay. Right, Tio. And how are you using your Klenel? So are you using it every day? I think I'm using that every day and the sound beauty mode just like as and when. So how are you using the Klenel? Is it twice a day? Yes, twice a day. Okay. And have you ever been admitted in hospital because your asthma was so bad? No, I haven't. Okay. Right here, when was the last time you had an asthma attack? About three to four years ago. three to four years ago. And what did the DP do at that time? Just encouraged me to continue using my inhalers as a preventative. Okay, so you didn't have any oral steroids or antibiotics? Not that I can remember. Okay, okay. Have you ever had oral steroids in the past? No. When was the last time you had an asthma atta review with our nurse. About two years ago. Okay, two years ago. Okay. But your asthma was pretty under control till now, isn't it? Yes, just in the last two to three days. So do you do a peak floor meter at home, peak floor reading, where you blow into, you know, do you do that now? Just every now and then. I haven't done it over the last, since I've had symptoms. Okay, so what was, what was your peak floor reading when you're good? Good. Like normal speak flow reading. I think 130. Okay, let's say it's about 380. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, right, so that's your normal, yeah. Right here. Okay, so what we need Okay, do you have any allergies at all? I have hay fever. Sorry, could you repeat that, please? Sorry, I have hay fever.? Okay, no, no, any allergies to medication? Oh, no, sorry. Okay, so you're not allergic to anything. Okay. So no allergies. Okay, excellent. Right here. So what we need to do that, obviously, we, you haven't had an asthma check for some time and it looks like you can be having a small, small exacerbation. So what I would like you to be seen by one of our GPs in the next few days. In the interim, what I'd like you to do is you can use your Blue inhaler as and when okay you can use it maximum about every two to four hours but if you're using it that often that means pretty much that you know your asthma is really bad you can use it but that's not ideal the brown in your klenel the brown inhaler you can up the dose if you're using just two puffs twice a day you can increase it to four puffs twice a day yeah and while this is to do while you're waiting to see us now okay as mentioned you know you're doing what you know increasing the dose. If you increase the Klenel to four puffs twice a day and you're using the blue inhalers every two to four hours and your breathing is getting really worse, then you would need to take yourself to A and E. You shouldn't wait for our appointment. Okay? So when your doctor sees you, what we're going to do is we're going to examine your chest, yeah? Make sure you do the peak that we're reading. So depending on what we find, you might need some antibiotics or some steroids. But anyway, while you're at home, we are going to by increasing your Klenel, we are increasing your steroid intake anyway. So yeah, so any questions you wanted to ask me? I'm not doing that at the beginning. Yeah, so book a point call support, book an appointment to see and I will recommend that you do a face to face. In the interim, increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hour. But if your breathing is getting worse and you've not seen enough, take your tooth to ANI. Okay? Great. Okay, thank you so much for your time. You're welcome. Take care then. Bye bye.
