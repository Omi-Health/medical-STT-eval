Yes, I am, yeah. Okay, fantastic. So how can I help you today? Yeah, I was I was having a bit of chest discomfort. So I was doing some gardening a couple of hours ago and I felt not exactly a pain but like a pressure on my chest. It feels like someone's sitting on my chest. And I've noticed a bit of nausea, not no vomiting, but I'm pretty sweaty, short of breath, and it kind of feels like someone's sitting on my chest. Right, okay. Now, do you have these symptoms right now or have they gone off now? No, they're still present. Okay, so you still have the chest discomfort right now? Yes. Okay. We're probably going to have to call an ambulance for you today. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to task my colleague next to me to sort that out. While we do that, I'm going to ask you a few more questions, okay? Sure. Give a bit more information to the ambulance team when they arrive, okay? Sure. So just to double check, where exactly in the chest is the pain? It's in the middle of my chest, over, yeah, my pectoralis. So, yeah, but not necessarily to one side. And then it's quite a diffuse pain. Right. Is it spreading anywhere else, like down to your arm, up to the jaw and the neck, anything like that? Yeah, it's it's mainly in my left arm. It's feeling a little bit painful and in my shoulder as well. Right, okay. Do you remember what you were doing at the time? Yeah, so it started just when I was gardening, so nothing that was too exhausting. I was just kneeling down and yeah, wasn't running or anything, I wasn't doing any physical exercise. Cool, okay. And how much activity do you do normally? Do you walk a lot or do you run or do you go to do anything? No, I don't. I generally don't do much activity at all. Have you had this before? No, this is the first time actually. Right, okay. Can you? Are you aware of any palpitations, like your heart beating faster or more prominently than normal? Yeah, it's beating a bit faster now. I think that's because I'm a little stressed about the situation, but I haven't noticed it beating faster than usual. So I know you're stressed. We've got an ambulance coming on the way. Okay. So we'll take care of everything. So don't worry. Is anyone in the house with you at the moment? No, no one is in the house at the moment. Okay. And is your front door open? Yes, it's open. Okay.

I'm going to stay on the line with you until they come. Okay. Okay. When they come, what they'll do is they'll be do is they'll put some stickers on your chest and do an ECG and then decide where to take you after that. Okay. And what, what, can I just double check?

Um, I've, I sometimes even have it and it's, it's a, it's a mild reaction to it. Okay. It's very important that you communicate that to the hospital. Okay. Detail you just told me because, um, we may need to consider aspirin despite, okay. Okay. Um, okay.
