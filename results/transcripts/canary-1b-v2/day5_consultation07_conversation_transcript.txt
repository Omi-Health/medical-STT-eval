Hi there, it's Dr. Smith from Babylon. Hi. Can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address, please? Sandra Bluff, 20 February 1958. And your home address? 74 Brother and Hill Court in St Albans. Okay, that's fine. Are you in a private place that you can have a consultation at the moment? Yes, I am. Okay, what can I do for you today? Well, five days ago I started having problems like a cough and my nose is just constantlyly streaming. Okay, and are you normally fit and well? Yeah, normally I'm diabetic, but other than that, like generally pretty good. Right, okay, so just tell me about the last, did you say five days? Yeah, five days or so ago. Okay, how bad is your cough at the moment? It's quite bad, it's kind of quite dry. I'm coughing maybe every twenty, thirty minutes or so. Okay, are you bringing up any phlegm at all? No. No. Any chest pain? Chest what? Any pain in your chest? No. Any difficulty with breathing? Feeling short of breath? Any pain when you take a deep breath? No, that's all fine. Have you coughed up any blood or anything like that? No. And what about your nose symptoms? On the front of the sinuses or anything? Nothing up here but just constant streaming, like using a million tissues. Okay, and any blood coming from the nose? No, it's pretty green. Right, okay. Any other symptoms like sore ears, sore throat? I've been feeling really hot. I don't know if it's fever as such, but to touch I'm pretty hot, but sometimes I'm feeling really chilly, needing to be under a blanket, that sort of thing. Have you checked your temperature with a thermometer? No, I haven't. Okay. And are you eating and drinking normally? Yes. Kind of around when it started I had some diarrhea, but I don't know if that was associated, but since then it's all been pretty fine. Okay. Drinking while holding down fluids okay? Yeah. And passing water okay? Yeah, that's fine. Are you vomiting diarrhea now? No. Okay, that's fine. Have you noticed any rashes? Rashes? Yeah. No, nothing like that. Any headaches or changes in your vision? No, I've had quite aching muscles, but that's pretty much it. Okay, and normally, do you have any chest problems? No. Do you ever get whizzing, short-time? I mean like if I do intense exercise and yes, but not normally. And do you regularly have any infections in your chest or anything that needs treatment normally? No, I've got hypertension, so I'm on some drugs for that, but that's it for me. Okay, any other medical problems? Just the hypertension and the diabetes. Okay, and what type of drugs are you on? I think something called metformin and lysinapril I think is the other one. Okay, and when did you last have your bloodod pressure checked? Oh, a while ago. Do you know if it's been stable? I can't remember. Okay. And with your blood, with your diabetes, have you had a blood test recently? Yeah. Like, yeah, it was normal. It was around three weeks ago. Okay. And do you know what dose of the lysinaprol you're taking? Uh, two hundred. Okay, have you been able to pass water normally? Any increase in frequency that you're passing water or any increased thirst? Uh, no, not particularly. And has your weight been stable? Yeah. What is your weight and height? Uh, my height is 1,75 m and my weight is 65 kg. Okay, and do you smoke at all? No. Do you drink any alcohol? Yes, the odd sherry. Okay. Who do you live with at home? My partner and my dog. And do you work? Yes, I'm an office manager. Okay. And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms? Anything that you've bought in the pharmacy? Um, quite a few LEMZips. They seem to be helping. Do you what do you mean by quite a few? How many in a day do you normally take? Maybe two or three, maybe like at the start of the day and at the end of the day and at the end of the day. Okay. Have you noticed any improvement in that? Yeah, it tends to soothe my throat a little bit for when I'm going to sleep. Okay. Have you any allergies to anything? I sometimes suffer from some like hay fever, but it's not too bad. Any allergies to any medications at all? Not that I'm aware of, no. Okay. So what you've described to me, it sounds like you probably have an infection in the chest because it's you know, you're obviously getting the symptoms from your nose and your chest. It sounds like you might have a high temperature, so it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature. Okay, I can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something. Yeah, most of the time these infections are caused by viruses, so they do normally settle by themselves, but it can take, you know, a week or two and you can persistently have the cough going on longer than that. The important thing to do would be to check your temperature. And if you feel like if the temperature is going on above 37.5, 38, you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down, or your cough is getting worse, you're coughing up a lot of nasty flem or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out of your nose, or any shorts or breath chest pain, then we certainly would need to speak to you again. With the diabetes, you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes. So it's something that we do need to be careful of. Okay, so then we would look at potentially antibiotics at that time, maybe? Yeah, potentially. If it is, if it's not settling or the temperature is on going, getting worse, then we definitely need to talk to you again. Okay. Have you got any other questions? No, that's all fine. It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment with the LEM sip. I wouldn't take and that's that contains paracetamol, so don't take any other paracetamol containing products with that at the same time. The cough syrup isn't advisable in the day time, it's best for your body if you just keep coughing but if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all then it's okay to have a little bit of cough syrup just to settle that down. Okay, cool. Okay. Do you have blood sugar checking equipment? Do you check? No, not at home. No, okay. Well, if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your GP has asked you for. Okay, great. All right then. Take care. Thanks very much. Bye.
