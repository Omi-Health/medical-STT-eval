Hello. Hello. Hi, hi. Hi, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you well. Hi, my name is Dr. Goughill. I'm one of the doctors that works at Babylon. Can I? Hi, doctor. Can I check your name and date of birth, please? Yes, my my name is Roberto Mendoza. Okay, I'm I was born on the first of January of 1992. Okay, and are you in a space that's quiet and you can talk? Oh, sorry, I am 1990 sorry, I'm 48. Sorry, I forgot the term. So you're 48 and are you able to talk at the the moment? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Tell me, it says here you have you're having problems going to the toilet. Yeah, so I have a I don't know how to say it properly in English. I mean, without something vulgar like diarrhea. Okay. Yeah, so it's lasting for like three days. And yeah, I don't know. I don't know what would cost it. I have a bit of pain, abdominal pain, and I had a bit of vomiting. And yeah, so this is kind of like the what is happening to me. Okay, tell me how you were three days ago before this started. Did you have any medical problems? So I have I have I have asthma and I take some some inhaler. Okay. I don't know I take an inhaler and I have an allergy. I have an NKDA allergy. Okay. So I don't know if it's because I don't know because you hate me or yeah. And apart from asthma, do you have anything else? I don't know, maybe it's because, you know, it's this thing here in the stomach stuff. I always have in the back of my head my father because he died about ten years ago of bone cancer. Okay. So yeah, this is kind of the my worries. I don't know. Okay. So you've had the diarrhea for three days and now you have pain and vomiting? Yes. Has the diarrhea been getting better or worse? I think it's not getting better or worse, it's kind of like, like, normal. Like it hasn't gone away, it hasn't worsened. Okay, and how often do you go to the toilet? I go, I need to go, I can't go to work because I need to go like every, I don't know, is this feeling like I go to the toilet and then when I finish I need to, I feel I need to go again. Okay. And, and, and, and, yeah., so I need to be like close to the toilet. That must be hard. Yeah, yeah. You have to drink more water than normal. I don't know. Maybe I'm not drinking enough water. Yeah, I drink, I think I, yeah, I don't know. I think I don't drink enough water. An important question. Have you noticed any blood? No, I haven't noticed any blood. And you mentioned tummy pain. Can you tell me more about your tummy pain? Like where it is and if it goes anywhere? So the pain is mainly focused in the center area of the abdomen, like under the belly, under the belly bottom. Yeah. And sometimes I can hear my stomach, like the crumbs. Yeah. Have you been able to eat and drink? Yeah, but yeah, but I go to the toilet so often, so I, I, yeah, I try not to eat a lot because I, yeah, I just go to the toilet every ten minutes. And you said the tummy pain is in the middle of your tummy. Does it go anywhere else? No, no, just there. And it seems to be alleviated by the toilet and maybe it's like trap gas. I don't know what what it is but okay and when was the last time you vomited? I think it was this morning this morning I but the thing is like because I'm not eating anything now so I haven't vomited again did you have any breakfast? I don't know I didn't no sorry yes I did actually I did I had some fruit I had some fruit okay and that and you vomited that up afterwards and afterwards I didn't have anything then I got a bit of nausea and I vomited and then yeah and that was it and that was it and I haven't any eaten since then. So now I'm I think I'm okay. But yeah, and I don't yeah. Did you notice any blood when you vomit? I think I do. I think I do. But this No, no, actually I can't say sorry. I'm sorry. I don't think there is blood because yeah, it was strawberries that I was having for breakfast. So yeah, it wasn't blood. Okay. And two days ago, did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain? I don't know, to be honest, sometimes. I have when I get a little bit of anxiety, I use my inhaler. But my inhaler kind of ran out of the one because, you know, I'm a foreigner, so I have this brand, but I bought the new one here. Okay. And I don't know, maybe this new one has caused it. Okay. It's a problem, I don't know. Okay. It's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause stomach pain like this. Normally it's when you eat bad food or food that has gone off. And you normally get symptoms like you have suggested. But just to double check, have you noticed any problems with your bre my breathing because of the asthma. Like when I take short, I need to use my inhaler a little bit, but apart from the normal, I haven't. Okay. And what about chest? Have you noticed any chest pain? No, I haven't noticed any chest pain. Okay. And what about walking and talking? Are those all okay? Walking and talking. Yes. Yes. But yeah, I don't walk very far because I need to. go to a toilet now and then so I'm spending some time at home. And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain? Oh, it does a little bit. Okay. Sorry, I was just writing some things down. So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain. Okay. And it's normal, this is normally called gastroenteritis, so an infection of the tummy. Okay. Normally when patients have this, we want to do three things. Number one is to drink a lot of of water and fluids because you're losing a lot at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers. So if you start getting a temperature, then you need to take morphetamol. And number three is to stay home for the time being until you get a little better. Okay. And normally, normally things like antibiotics don't help. They make the situation worse. Okay. So that's I did, yeah. Go ahead. No, I was saying I didn't have any fever recently. I was sweating a little bit last for bed, but I'm not sure if I had a little fever, but very little or but I don't think so. I don't think. I don't know. Maybe. So I think that's what we should do for the time being. If you feel you're getting much worse, then I would suggest you go see your GP in real, in real life, in person, so they can look at your belly. Okay. I will. Yeah. I will book then. I will book to. I will wait a couple of days to see or one more day and then I will book. Great. Yeah. Cool. Do you have any more questions for me? Uh, no. I was maybe just concerned about my father's medical history if that would put you at some kind of risk. So the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your stomach and less likely to be something your father had, but if your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look at from the GP. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah, that sounds good. That sounds good. Thank you. Thank you very much, doctor, for your time. Bye bye.
