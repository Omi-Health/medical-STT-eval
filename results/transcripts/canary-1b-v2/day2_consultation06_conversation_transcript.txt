Good morning. Hello. Hi there. I'm Dr. Dean Mezer from Babylon. Good morning. Good morning. Sorry, before we start, could I get your full name and date of birth? Is that possible? Yeah, sure. My name is Guan Doe and I'm 27 years old. So I was born in 1991, 17 November. That's perfect. Thank you for that. Are you, John, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yeah. Perfect, thank you for that. Okay, so tell me what the problem is. You've been having some difficulty with breathing, is that correct? Yeah, exactly. I'm kind of struggling with breathing right now. I got stung by a wasp recently, well, I'm not sure whether it's kind of bitten or stung, but I'm feeling like slightly anxious that there's a bit of I've got a bit of a rash on my arm where I got stung. And I'm kind of, yeah, as I say, I've got this difficulty with breat breathing and potentially there's a little swelling in my lips and tongue. Feels a little weird. Right, okay. So when did this beast thing or bee bite occur? It was just a few minutes ago. Right, okay. And your lips don't seem swollen to me right now, but do they, which can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen? Yeah, it's just kind of on the right hand side and it's just a little sore. Maybe it hasn't kind of rehe really swollen up yet. Oh, okay. You said you've been having some difficulty with breathing. Yeah. Your breathing seems right to me right now. The reason why I'm clarifying you is because we have to decide whether this is an acute emergency, whether I need to send you to hospital right away, or whether I need more time to ask questions, okay? So, do you feel like you've got difficulty with breathing right now, this minute, as we speak? I don't feel like it's particularly acute, but I'm just kind of a little anxious that it might get a little worse. I just wanted to talk to someone. Sure. Now you did the right thing and I can understand it. It is quite anxiety provoking. Okay, all right. Can I just double check before we carry on and ask any other questions? Have you got history of anaphylaxis? Uh, not that I know of. No, okay. Have you ever been given an EpiPen? Uh, I haven't, no. Okay, all right. Let's take a step back now. So, in terms of the beesing, did you see the bee or you're just assuming it was a bee a B? I find it difficult to tell the difference between a B and a what, but it was one of the two. Yeah, it was one of the two. Okay, okay. And the area of your body that stung, where was it? You say it was your arm? Yeah, it was on my arm. Okay, and you've got a rash there, can I have a look? Yeah, sure. It's just, just there. Okay, okay. That looks okay to me right now. Did it look red to you right now? It's it's slightly red, yeah, and there's a bit of a like a hole where I think that the Yeah, yeah, yeah. The puncture mark, yeah, okay, all right. Now, is there any swelling around that area that you can see? I couldn't see any. Not particularly, I guess it's just a bit, kind of, blotchy and a bit of a rash. It doesn't feel like particularly swollen. Sure, okay, all right. Now, have you taken any medications? Probably you probably haven't because it was a few minutes ago, but have you is it not taking any antihistamines or anything like that? Not at the not at the moment, no, nothing, nothing yet. Okay. Now, if I can just go back, do you have any history of any kind of illnesses at all? I've had eczema before. Okay. That's kind of the main thing. Nothing, nothing. Okay. Have you got a history of any allergies to anything? I'm allergic to penicillin. Okay, good. And in your family, is there any history of any illnesses or any history of any kind of acute? Not that I think is particularly relevant, no, I don't have any. Right, and do you have allergies to any kind of cats or dogs or pets or anything like that? Not that I know of. I've been around dogs and cats. And you have no food allergies as far as you know? No. Okay. Can I ask, do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks or anything like that? Yeah, sometimes, occasionally. Right, okay. Have you ever been on medication for that? No. Oh, no. Great. Now I need to ask a few questions, maybe not directly related to this, but just for general information purposes. So are you working at the moment? Yes. What do you work as? I am a computer scientist. Okay. And are you living alone? Yes. Okay. Do you have any pets at home? I have a cat. Okay. Great. What I'd like to do now, if that's okay, John, is I'd like to have a look inside your mouth. Okay. One of the things that we'd be worried about. if someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction, to see if there's any swelling of the lips or the tissues inside the mouth or the soft tissues of the airway. And I can, I've got a pretty good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put your head back, mouth open wide, sit somewhere where there's good lighting and I just want to have a look inside the throat if that's okay. Perfect, okay, great. Now, can I just get you to do it again? Just say ah this time. Ah okay, fantastic, brilliant. Okay. John, based on how you look, how you're talking to me, how you're breathing and the appearance on your wrist, I don't feel that you're having a life threatening allergic reaction. Now, it's very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite. It's a localized allerg inflammatory reaction that is normal and that immediate reaction, that redness and that maybe slight swelling is usually temporary. What we're worried about is when someone has compromised of their breathing. So you mentioned breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling of your lip. Thankfully, I can't see any of that right now. But that's the most urgent and most pressing thing that we'll be watching out for. Given that it hasn't happened initially, it's unlikely to happen later. Okay, so we have like a stage one and stage two reaction for these types of bites. And usually if you're going to have their reaction, it will happen right away. So we may be coming out of the danger zone now, but I'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens. So for example, you would have swelling of the lips, difficulty with breathing, you might have something called stridal, which is an inspiratory sound that when you're trying to breathe, it makes it like a rasping sound like this. Okay, so thankfully you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me like this is a localized allergic reaction. However, if anything changes, if anything deteriorates, either make an appointment with us or go straight to A and E. And in some cases, if it's progressing rapidly, it's better to go straight to A and E rather than wait for a booked appointment with us. Okay, what I'd like you to do now is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines. So you can buy them at the counter, you can get Piriton or Clorfenamine and you can take some one tablet, four milligrams, up to about six times a day. Or you can just take one a day, whichever is your preference, that's absolutely fine. There's no, no problem. That should be enough to control this. If the redness in your arm spreads and you feel hot or you have signs of any localized infection, we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic. And as I said, if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing, that's early and we need to process that. We need to take some action that needs to be takenen urgently. Have you had any other queries or was there anything else that you were worried about? No, I think that kind of that makes me feel a bit better. I guess, can I get that? Can I get the antihistamine from any shop or like, does it have to over the counter? You don't need any chemist will have it. You don't need to buy it. Yeah, it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually than to get it by prescription. Okay. Now, based on what you told me, I don't think you need any allergic testing. I think this is just a straightforward, localized reaction to an insect bite. However, if it should happen that you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other non-suppositive rations, you might need to think about blood testing. I don't think we're at that moment yet. Okay. So, but that's something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurring pattern. Okay. Okay then. So, we'll leave it like that for now. Okay. I'm going to leave a link to some information about anaphylactic reactions just for you to read about it. it. I don't need to panic, but just for you to be aware of what some of the symptoms are. If such things happen, come back to us. If you're feeling worried, just have a low threshold for having a chat with us. Sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down. Okay, great. Yeah, that makes sense. All right then, John. Okay. Well, we'll leave it like that. Come back to us if you have any further issues. Okay, thanks. I appreciate your time. My pleasure. All right. Take care then. All the best. Bye bye.
