Hello? Good morning, Kim. How can I help you this morning? So I'm having some pain in my stomach, like the lower part of my stomach. Okay. And I'm just getting quite hot and sweaty. Right, I'm sorry to hear that. When when did your symptoms all start? About two days ago. Okay. And where about in your stomach is the pain exactly? Like, below my belly button. It's like, quite sore when I press on it. Okay. Did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual? No, it hasn't been, it's more gradual and it's just, it's getting a bit worse now. Okay. Okay. And can you describe the pain to me? It's kind of like, I guess, a burning pain. And it's just right there in that spot. Like, that's mostly where I'm feeling it. Has it spread anywhere else? Just in just under your belly button you mentioned. Yeah. Okay. And is the pain constant or does it come and go? It's really constant. It's like getting worse. It's not like I can still move and walk around. I mean, I'm still kind of functioning. It's just I'm aware of it all the time. Okay. And with that pain, have you noticed any other symptoms at all? So for example, let's focus first on your bowels. Are your bowels working okay? Yeah. I had a little constipation, but that's better now than it was since last week. Okay, so you don't have any other symptoms like diarrhea or loose stols? No, my bowel movements are normal now. Okay, and what about your water works? Are you passing your urine okay? Yeah, I'm fine, that's fine. I did notice that I was a little, the urine was a little pink in color, but I haven't like, it hasn't really been burning specifically or hurting when I pee. And I did notice I was going to the I was peeing more regularly, but I have been drinking a lot of fluid, so I wasn't sure if that was related to the pain. When you mentioned pink urine, was there any blood at all in your urine or is it difficult to say? I can't say, I mean maybe. Okay, all right, but otherwise it doesn't do or sting when you pass urine. I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that. Just that I'm pissing more than off more regularly. Okay. And moving up towards other symptoms, have you noticed any vom vomiting or feeling nauseous at all? Just a little nauseous, but no vomiting. No vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers? I haven't I felt a little hot and sweaty, but I haven't really measured it, so I can't really say. Okay, fine. And Kim, do you have to ask, you know, all female patients, just questions about your cycle, if you don't mind if I ask. Are you currently sexually active? Yeah, I've had the same partner. I am. We were last sexually active about four days ago. My last STD screen was normal, which was about six months ago. Okay, so you've had no other partners since then? No other partners since then. Okay, and do you use any contraception at all? I'm on the implanon, I had the implanon inserted about a year ago. Implement, okay, fine. Are you still having periods? Yes. And when was your last period? My last period was about three weeks ago, I mean two weeks ago? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago. Okay. So is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implant in bed. Is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? Is there something for us to think about? We don't use any other barrier methods. So we just use the I just have the implant on and the same partner. Theoretically, if the implant on hasn't been working, then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect. Okay. Well, something for us to think about. Maybe we'll have to do a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that. Okay. And so just to summarize, so far, if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple days this tummy pain has really affected you. mainly lower down towards your belly button. It's quite burning. You said it's getting worse. You notice some pink urine, but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine. Your bowels are working okay. You felt a little nauseous and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right? Yeah, that sounds very accurate. Is there anything else perhaps that you feel like you should share with me at this stage which you think might be important? I don't think so. I think that we've covered everything that's really bothering me. Yeah, okay. Tell me a bit more about your medical history otherwise, are you normally fit and well? Yeah, quite well. I haven't had any surgical I don't have any surgical history. I don't have any previous I haven't had any operations before and I'm not on any other medication. I just had the implant. Okay. Have you had anything like this before in the past? Any similar symptoms? I've never had I've never had these symptoms before. No, okay. Fine. Any other family history I should be aware of? Anything relevant family? related to the bowels, maybe related to guiding history? No, not that I'm aware of that. Okay, all right. And socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? I live in a share house with two other two other roommates. Okay, and are you currently working? Yeah, I'm currently working What do you do for work? I'm an accountant. Okay. Do you smoke at all, Tim? No. No. And do you drink much in terms of alcohol? Socially I drink, but I don't think more than normal. No, okay. Just before I go to the examination, just want to go through just a few screening questions, that's okay, yes or no. We've covered most of them already, but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else. How's your how's your chest? How's your breathing? I don't feel short of breath or I'm not having any problems or I don't have a cough or anything that's worrying me. Okay. Any funny heartbeats or rhythms, palpitations? Nothing, no. Okay. Any headaches, any problems with your vision? No. Okay. All right. Fine. Okay. So really just moving on. So based on your story, really, Kim, it's a difficult one.. We know you've got some primary pain. We don't know exactly what's causing it. There could be a few different things that could be causing your pain. Could this be a, you know, could this be a urine infection, for example? Could this be something related to your gut? Could this be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy related cause? And so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out what's going on here, which I can organise for you today. Okay. And based on those tests, we will have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed. But certainly, if it's been going on for the last couple of days, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for maybe a urin infection. And so with some with some Can we do that instead of me going for tests and then seeing how that goes? Yeah, absolutely. So I think it's certainly worth covering you with some antibiotics today. But I still want you to keep in mind, you know, having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here. And I want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days' time if your symptoms are not getting better or indeed if they're getting worse. So things to look out for would be, you know, worsening stomach pain, if you're feeling really hot or sweating, your temperature is not coming down, vomiting, et cetera. Does that make sense? Yeah, I think I'm happy with that plan. Okay. You can try just regular painkillers. Paracetamol will be advisable. Make sure you drink a lot of fluids. You can try some cranberry juice as well. Which can sometimes help with your urine symptoms. Take the antibiotics and give me a call if you're worried about anything else. Sure, that sounds great. Thank you very much. Should I just collect the script at my pharmacy? Yeah, by sending it straight to your pharmacy, start the antibiotics today, something called trimethoprine. We'll take two tablets, one tablet twice a day for three days. Okay, that sounds great. Let's see how you get on. Okay, thank you very much. Great, all the best. Bye. Bye.
