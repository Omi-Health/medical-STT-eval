Alex? Oh, hello. How can you hear me? Yeah. Okay, great. How can I help you this morning, sir? Hi, so I've been feeling I've been feeling kind of under the weather for the past four days. It started with a sore throat and runny nose and it's sort of it's sort of going into a cough now. The sore throat is kind of going away, but I'm starting to cough. Okay. Sorry to hear that. Kind of bad and tired. Okay, I'm sorry to say that. It seems like there's a lot going on there. So let's start with your sore throat first. Um, tell me a bit more about that if you can. Um, so I, you know, I think I it all started with a colleague of mine. She she just kept sneezing next to me all the time. I think her kids are catching something from the, uh, from the kindergarten or something. And, uh, you know, that it started as normal sore throat and okay. It was quite painful for a couple of days, but then it was past. Okay, and did you have any difficulty or pain with swallowing? Yeah, yeah, it was, it was quite painful to swallow. Okay. For one of the days. Did you manage to have a look in the back of your throat in the mirror? No, not really. No, okay, you didn't, you didn't notice any abnormal white spots or redness at the back of your throat? No, I didn't think about looking. That's okay, that's okay. And you mentioned the running nose. Again, what kind of discharge is coming out? Is it clear or is it a bit more colored? Yeah, yeah, it's yeah, it's clear, but it's sort of getting my nose stuffed all the time. It's very hard to get it free. Okay, so you feel quite congested, Gigi? Yeah, quite congested. Okay, fine. You also mentioned a cough as well. Can you tell me a bit more about that? Yeah, that started recently, like just maybe yesterday, and it's it's dry for now. It's not very painful, but it's sort of there all the time. Okay, and is it worse at any particular time of the day? Sorry? Is it worse at any particular time of the day, for example, in the evenings, night time, mornings or is it throughout the day? No, it's it's it's sort of it's sort of constant. Okay. I forgot to mention that I'm also having night sweats and night sweats. That's very odd actually and that sort of makes me a bit tired. Mm. and makes my sleep a bit uneasy. I can imagine, yes. And this has again been going on for the last three, four days, has it? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Right. Okay. Have you noticed any fever or temperatures at all? I had some fever in the beginning, but it's now sort of going down. I've been taking some paracetamol and ibuprofen for that, and they help. That's very sensible. Very good. In terms of your chest otherwise, do you have any difficulty with breathing or any pain in your chest? So no pain in chest, but I notice that I so I feel a bit winded on exertion. So if I I haven't been going to the gym that's because of that. When you say windy, do you feel more short-hot, would you say, on exertion? Is that what you mean? Okay. And that's mainly on exercise, but when you're resting, there's no problems. Yeah, yeah, when I'm resting, it's okay. So I've been actually going to work and sort of managing. Okay, fine. Just a couple of other questions, sir, if you don't mind. Any pain in your ears at all? No. You don't feel blocked or any discharge coming out of your ears? I don't think so. Okay. What I'm going to do, I'm going to run through a few yes, no questions, if you don't mind, just a review of your systems. Any, any headaches at all? Yeah, yeah, that's still, that's still there. Where about other headaches? Just kind of general, and they're not, they're not always there, but you know, every now and then they would come and go. Okay, and with the headaches, have you any problems with your, with your sight, your vision? No. Any difficulty with seeing bright lights? No, I don't think so. Okay. And just moving down now, in terms of any, any feeling of nausea or any vomiting? No, nothing of that. Okay. Tell me about your bowels. Are your bowels working okay? Yeah, yeah, I think so. And passing urine okay? Yeah, yeah. How's your appetite, sir? Yeah, I've been drinking a little bit more than usual, but so a bit other than that. Okay. And you eating and drinking, are you eating okay otherwise? Maybe a little less than what I would normally have. Okay. Have you noticed any funny rashes at all on your skin? Um, no. No. And any general muscle pain or aches, joint pain or whatever? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's sort of started in the past couple of days. Yeah. Okay. All right. Um, and just having looked at the rest of your history, are you otherwise fit well or do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? Um, so otherwise that I'm fine. There's, um, there's nothing that I'm taking or I'm being treated for. Okay. Um, so you're otherwise fit good. Any allergies at all to any medications I should be aware of? No, no, okay. Any family history at all? So anything relevant in the family that I should be aware of, anything like diabetes, high blood pressure? Yeah, my grandma has diabetes. Your brother? And my grandma. You say grandma, sorry, my apologies. Grandma, okay. Do you know what type of diabetes it is? Is it type one? I think it's type two. Okay. Anything else which you think is significant? Yeah. Yeah, I think one of my great granddad had an eczema. Excellent, okay. Okay. Just moving on to what we say, social history, just getting to know you a bit more as a person. Tell me, who do you live with at home? I live alone. Okay. And you said you're working at the moment, is that right? Yeah, yeah. What do you do for work? I'm an accountant. Okay, and how's your work going at the moment? Has it been affecting your work? A little bit. I've been a bit slower and, you know, it's a it's a bit of of a stressful period just around the end of the year. Okay. Is that stress affecting your, um, your mood at all in any way? Um, no, I think, I think it's, it's, you know, it's the good kind of stress. It's good work. Well, if there's anything you ever want to talk to me about, you can always come and see me about your mood and stress, anxiety. We're happy to help. No, no, I like my job. It's just, you know, it's a bit more work. Okay. Okay. And just very briefly, just in terms of smoking, uh, do you smoke at all? Um, yeah, occasionally, no cigars and things on company parties. Okay. So not regular. And what about alcohol? Occasionally I would have some. I'm not a very big drinker. Again, socially would work. Okay. So, sir, just having listened to your story, really just to summarize, you know, it's the last four days you've been feeling generally quite well, sore throat, running nose, a bit of a dry cough, a bit of muscle pain, weakness, had initial fever, but now settled. I don't think there's much to worry about. I think you probably have, you know, a bit of a viral, what we say, viral illness, or maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infectionection or maybe early signs of a flu. These normally last for about seven to ten days and just get better really over time. But things you can do to really help yourself is get a lot of rest. I'll probably advise you to take a day or two off work if you can, making yourself, you know, pushing fluids and make yourself well hydrated, continuing with the regular paracetamol and ibuprofen. And we should see how things go really. If next week you're still a lot better, I'd like you to come back and see me. Is that clear? Does that make, does that make Yeah, that's that's that's that's all good., it makes sense. I think I'll take a couple days off. Yeah. And see how it goes. And things to look out for if you're really not getting better, if you have a high fever or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored or chest pain, I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner. Give me a call and we can help you out, okay? Yeah, yeah, I understand. I'll take care. Great. Have a great day. Good luck with your work. Thank you. Thank you. You too. Have a good night.
