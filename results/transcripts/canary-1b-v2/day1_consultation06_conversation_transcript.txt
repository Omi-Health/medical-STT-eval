Hello? Hello there. Hello, can you hear me okay? Yes, I can hear you. Okay, great. So you're your doctor? I am, yes. Doctor Seed here, Oscar. How can I help you this afternoon? I'm contacting you because I've been quite short of breath lately. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about it? So when did it all start? Well, it seems to have been slowly getting worse over the last couple of weeks. It's become quite troublesome in the last few days. I kind of normally I can walk the shops without a problem, but now I'm having to kind of sit down and catch my breath and I'm even starting to get a little breathtaking just about the house. And it's got me kind of worried. I don't really know what's going on. Okay, okay. Is there anything you're particularly worried about? Well, I've got heart failure. Okay. I was told that a while ago and I got a little breathtaking when I was first diagnosed. Right. And put on some medication that's that's that's that. That helped, but I'm a little worried it's just getting worse. Right, okay. So you mentioned you've been feeling breath short for the last couple of weeks, but maybe the last couple of days has got a little worse and you're now feeling more breath short on kind of minimal, minimal exertion you mentioned. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all with your breath, so for example any pain in your chest? No pain in my chest. Okay. Have you found yourself coughing at all? I've got a little bit of a dry cough, but it's not too troublesome. Okay, okay. And how's your general health otherwise? Are you feeling weak a little run down, but otherwise, otherwise pretty normal. I've noticed my ankles have gotten a bit bigger. Okay, and what do you mean by that? It's just like they've sort of swollen up a bit. Okay, is that both ankles? Yeah, both ankles. Yeah, it's a bit embarrassing. Okay, I can imagine, yeah. And again, over how long has this, have you noticed this for? I kind of noticed it the last few days. Last few days, okay. And is this something that you've had before in the past? I think my ankles did swell up a bit last time the heart failure was a problem. Okay, okay. Fine, okay. So just to really recap, so really the last couple of weeks you've been feeling breathless but worse than the last couple of days. You mentioned you had a little bit of a dry cough and some swelling in your ankles, but importantly, no chest pain. And have you noticed your heartbeat racing at all? So palpitations or skipped heartbeat? No, not really. Okay. And any temperatures or fevers? No. I know. Okay. And what about your appetite? Are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, I'm that's fine. Okay. And your water works? Are you passing urine okay? Yeah, that yeah. I usually piss a lot. Yeah. A bit of the drugs. Sure, okay, all right. Fine. So moving on to your past medical history. You mentioned heart failure. Any other medical history I should be aware of? Well, I was told I had like a they called it like a small heart attack about five years ago. I had I had like some chest pain and they took me to hospital. Okay. And they but then I just got better. Okay. When you say small heart attack, did they give you a name for what happened, a name of a diagnosis? I can't remember. They just called it something like that, small heart attack. Small heart attack, okay. Was it like angina or? No, they said it seemed it was like more than angina. Okay. But I didn't, but I only had to stay in hospital for a few days. Okay. Yeah, I've been okay since then. You've been okay since then. Okay, all right. So apart from the heart, the heart problems, the heart failure, any other problems I should be aware of? No, I think I'm otherwise, I'm okay. Okay. Do you take any regular medications apart from your the diuretics that you're taking? And do you know which ones? Yeah, I take something called furosemide. Furosemide. And do you know what dose you're taking? I can't remember. I'm sorry, doctor. I'll have to check. No problems. Any other medications? Yeah. Yeah, I take aspirin. Okay. And loprilol. That metoprolol was it? Or? Loprilol. Sorry, the connection is not very good. Okay, thank you. Yeah. And symbostatin. Symbostatin, okay, all right. Any allergies at all? Any medications? No, no allergies. Okay. Is there anything in the family that's that's important for me to know? Any family history of medical problems, heart problems, lung problems? My father died of a heart attack. I'm sorry to hear that. How old was your father when he died? He was early sixties. Early sixties, okay. Anything else I should be aware of? My mother had osteoporosis. Okay. Is your mother still with us? Yeah, she's still living. Okay, all right. And socially, sir, just tell me a bit more about your situation at home. Who lives at home with you? I live alone. I've got two cats. You got two cats, okay, great. Do they have names? They're my family. They're called Polly and Tim. Okay. So it's just Junior Cats. And in terms of day to day, are you working at the moment? I work part time as a lorry driver. Okay. And how is that? Is that quite stressful? Long hours? It's okay. I Yeah, like when I'm working, it's pretty exhausting. I guess I'm a little worried that if I'm a little worried that if I get sick, I won't be able to work properly. Yeah, this is certainly a consideration, isn't it? So let's try and get you better soon so it doesn't have any impact on your job. And do you find yourself doing a lot of antisocial hours? Do you do a lot of night driving, weekend driving? Oh, no. I only take shifts during the day. I don't like working at night. Okay. All right. And what about smoking and alcohol? So, because they can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems. Do you smoke at all? Not anymore. So, you used to smoke? Yeah. And how many did you smoke a day on average? Oh, it was about about a pack a day back in the day. And how many how many years was that for? Oh, that was good 25 years. Okay. Well done for stopping. It must have been very difficult for you. Well done for stopping. And what about alcohol? I don't drink alcohol. Okay. Do you do much in the way of exercise, sir? I try and walk the shops at least once a day. Okay. But that's about it. I've, yeah, I don't, I don't go running like I used to when I was young. Right, okay. And certainly now with your symptoms, you said you're feeling more breathtaking even walking to the store, to the shop, she said. Right. So, based on your, based on your history and having listened to your story, I wonder if you've had a flare up of your heart failure, sir, which can sometimes happen. And, you know, it's What's going on? So, it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be. And obviously having diagnosed heart failure, there's obviously, it's the first thing that comes to mind. Now there's a couple of options to move forward. Given that you're otherwise well at the moment and having examined you, your chest and your saturations and blood pressure all okay, I'm quite happy to increase your dose of frusamide. So maybe rather than one tablet a day, we can give you two tablets a day for the first few days and see how you're getting on. Okay. Do you think that would be best? I think it's definitely worth treating your symptoms, but what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart to see how well your heart's pumping. Okay. Is that something you've had? Yeah. An echo scan, it's a jelly scan of your heart. You may have had this done before when you were diagnosed and it's just to get a good Oh yes, I remember now. Sorry? Yeah, I remember now. Okay, fine. That's something I can organise for you today and it may take a week or two weeks for that to be organised. But I think certainly in the meantime, let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's let's get a blood test done. We can check your you know, your full blood can look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function and we can definitely increase your frozenmide to you know, one tablet twice a day. But I really like we'd like you to come back and see me in about a week's time to see how you're doing. Does that sound reasonable? I think that sounds like a good plan. And of course, in the meantime, if you are getting more on well, so if you're getting more breath trying or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizzyness, then you know, Senna, I want you to give me a call sooner than that and we can have a chat on the phone as well. Okay, I'll see how it goes. Okay, do you have any questions for me? I think that's all pretty clear. Thank you very much, doctor. Great, and then I wish you all the best. Have a good day. See you soon. Thank you.
