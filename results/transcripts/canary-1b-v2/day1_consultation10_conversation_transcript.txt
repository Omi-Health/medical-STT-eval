next door. Hello. Hello. Hi. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, I hear you. Right, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Sure. I'm Amanda Jackson and I'm nineteen years old. Nineteen years old. Okay, Amanda, and how can I help you this afternoon? So it's been going on for a few days now. It's happened before and I'm a bit worried. It hurts when I kind of pee. And yeah, it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more and it's really like I can't go to the unit properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. It does. It kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in the bottom of my stomach as well. Right, okay. I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you. So you mentioned it's been going on for the last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. You said you're going to the toilet more often as well, is that right? Yeah, it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days, I think actually. Maybe just under a week. Oh, under a week, sorry. Okay. Sorry, no, I didn't explain it properly before. Yeah, no, it's been going on for about just under a week. And yeah, I noticed a kind of burning, stinging when I go to the toilet. Yeah. Have you noticed anything in your urine, for example, any blood or discoloration of your urine? I think well, today I noticed that it was like a bit pink, the urine. Okay. Yeah, I think just today. Have you noticed any kind of frank blood, I mean red blood at all in your urine? I think it was in, probably, I don't know, it was pink. Okay, fine. We'll definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on. You also mentioned some tummy pain as well. Can you come in a little bit more about that pain? Yeah, it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy. My stomach, mainly when I go to the loo, I think that's when it's worse. Okay. Can you describe it as a crampy pain? Is it more of a burning pain? I wouldn't describe it as crampy. I don't think it's like a period pain. It's a bit different. It's, it's hard to say, an achy pain, I suppose. Achy pain. Okay. Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back, towards your sides? No. No, no. Okay. All right. Any other symptoms at all? For example, nausea, vomiting? No. No nausea, vomiting. Okay. Any temperatures or fevers? Um, no, not that I've noticed. Okay, all right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working okay? I I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any different. Okay. And what usually is. When you say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have? Um, I think I have, um, IBS. Um, so I just kind of pass my bowels like quite a lot. And sometimes it's quite variable, like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, sorry, it's a bit disgustusting, but like, it's a bit hard to predict. Okay, all right, but basically there's no new symptoms, no, no, no new symptoms in your bells. No, no, not that. Okay, all right. And Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions, as you can imagine. Can I ask, are you currently sexually active? Yeah, I have a long term boyfriend. Okay. And have you noticed any other discharge from below, so from the fun passage? No, no, I don't think so. Nothing unusual. Okay. Have you do you use any form of contraception? Uh, yeah. I'm on the pill. The pill? What kind of pill is it? Is it a combined pill or the mini pill? Combined pill. Okay. Fine. Um, when was the last time you had, um, unprotected sex? If you don't want me to ask that. Uh, I mean, unprotected is in like no, no condoms or anything. Yeah, exactly. I guess because I don't reallyt know, we've just kind of agreed. So I guess a week ago, two weeks ago. Okay, all right. I guess what I'm trying to get at is whether there's any chance you'll be pregnant at all. I know you're on the pill, but we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, Eating drinking okay. I did have one kind of concern. I don't know. So I smoked, this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time like a week and a half ago. I just wondered whether it's related at all. Probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. Sure. Well, thanks for sharing with me. So I don't think it is related to your symptoms. I think it's probably just pure coincidence. But I do strongly advise you to make it a regular habit if you can, just for your general health moving forward. Okay. Moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions apart from the IBS? Is there anything else I should be aware of? No. No. Okay, great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the combined pill? Apart from the pill, I take something for the IBS as well. It begins with an M. It's pretty hard to pronounce, like maybe something. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, that's right. Okay. And then that for the cramps, the crampy pain. Yeah. And do you have any allergies to any medications? Yeah, I think there was an antibiotic called Clindus Clindamycin. Clindamycin. That took like a couple of years ago, something. And yeah, that didn't go too well. Right. Okay, sure. I'll make a note of that. In terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? No. No problems with anything else. Good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? So I'm living in Halls at the moment, Uni. So I'm just living with a flatmate, I suppose. But my family lives kind of outside of London, not too far away. So yeah, my family are fine and I see them now and then. Very good. Yeah, things I think are okay, generally. Great. And what are you studying at university? I'm studying English. English, okay. Good. And how are you enjoying your course? Yeah, yeah, it's going well. Thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago. Yeah, I really enjoy it. Very good. In terms of smoking and alcohol, do you participate in either? As I admitted before, I tried weed the first time, but I don't smoke. I drink occasionally, kind of socially, with friends. Okay, what what made you have your first joint last week? It was just a party and there were a lot of people doing it. I was kind of a little bit tipsy, so I probably wasn't thinking quite straight. But yeah, I completely agree, it's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure, and of course, your doctor's something to take care of you, so I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid it. Great. Fine, so at this age I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think, you know, I'm really reassured by the fact that I think it's probably just a simple, what would we say, UTI or a cystitis, black infection. You know, you don't have any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about. So things like fevers and back pain would be more worrying for me to hear. So some of them we can treat quite easily with antibiotics. So we've got a choice of two antibiotics, something called trimethoprin or nitrofurantoin, which is a three-day course. Normally they're usually quite effective for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well, if you can, so we can send it off to the lab and see if it's. going on there. Start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink a lot of fluids. If you're having some pain, simple paracetamol would probably be advisable. We'll see what the urine sample shows and if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. But if things are still not getting better next week, come back and see me and we can have another look again. Okay, okay, great. With the urine sample, how do I go about doing that? Well, that's a good question. So I will give you, I will organise for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices, which we can test there and then with urine density and send it off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results. Okay, perfect. Okay, great. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call, okay? Fever, back pain, vomiting. Great, okay, yeah. I'll be up close. Okay, have a good day. Okay, great. Thank you, you too. Happy New Year. Bye.
