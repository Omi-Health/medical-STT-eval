You have to do it as part of your training as a doctor. Hello. Hi. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear fine. Hi, my name is Dr. Gohill. I'm one of the general practitioners that works here. Can I check your name and date of birth, please? I am Patrick Smith. Hi. 35 years old. October 7, 19. Great. P something. And Patrick, are you in a space that's private and quietiet. Yes. Great. And so we're okay to chat? Yes, we are. Okay. So it says here, you are feeling hot and have had severe headaches. Is that correct? Yeah. It's really affecting my work. It comes and goes. I kind of feel like it's hard. I kind of lose my appetite also. One thing that's kind of weird is I sometimes also get some tingling in my arms. Okay. Yeah. And especially, for example, when I come into the elevator in the morning, okay. I kind of have my heart beating kind of fast. Okay. So those are lots of things. Are they all happening at the same time? Oh, no, it's randomly, like, yeah, it's at different times. And do they all happen at the same time or is it one thing, one time, and one time? Roughly one thing at a time. Okay. So let's start with the headaches. When they do come, do you have any idea the headache is going to come? Uh, not really, but generally during work times. So it's normally at work. I'm at work, I'm in a meeting or on my laptop. Okay. And where does the headache sit in your head? Is it in front or back? Um, I can't say. So it's like, kind of, okay. And does it go anywhere else? Does it go anywhere else? The headache? No, it's mostly in front and then, yeah, it just kind of stays there. And when you have the headache specifically?, do you get sick? Not really, but it's like making it hard. I yeah, I kind of feel a little nauseous, maybe. Okay. And sometimes I also feel like Yeah, it's like maybe proper breathing or something. Okay. And do you normally get headaches before all this started? So, no, I feel like my health situation was mostly under control. Okay. Yeah. And then let's But it started roughly when I changed jobs. Okay. So talk to me about your job. What do you do? I'm a lawyer. And do you work in London at the moment? Yes. So do you get these headaches on your commute to work? Not really. I get it mostly when I'm at work. Okay. And tell me about what you do. Do you sit in front of a computer most of the time or do you talk to people? Like fifty, fifty, go to meetings and then sit in front of a computer. Okay. Does a person love reading? And these things have happened mostly when you're sitting at your computer? Yeah, it happens then. Okay, and tell me, what did you do before being a lawyer? No, I was a lawyer at a previous job as well. Okay. So talk to me about the stress that you're under at the moment. If ten out of ten is extremely stressful and one out of ten is on vacation, where are you at the moment? I think it's seven or eight. And is that normal for you? Yeah, it's like a law firm, like there's always pressure. Okay. So you mentioned your headaches, you also mentioned your reduced appetite, so you don't want to eat as much. Yeah. Have you lost weight? Yes. Can you remember how much you've lost? Five pounds. And is that because you're going to the gym or is that unintentional? It's not intentional, no. Okay. So have you noticed your clothes feeling looser? Not really. Ah, no. And have people said or commented that you've lost weight? No. Great. And another thing that you also mentioned is that you notice tingling in your hand? Yeah. So talk to me about that. Is it in one hand or both hands? Both. And do you get that in your legs as well? No. And what does it feel like, the tingling? Prickling, yeah. And again, is this the first time you've noticed this? Yeah. Okay. And the other two things that I've just jotted down is you're feeling hot, but you didn't mention that. Is that correct? No. But like, I would say like, I get this feeling of short, like, short breath. Okay. Sometimes. So that could be what you were referring to. Yes. So do you feel short breath while you're sitting at your desk? Yeah. No. Yes. Sorry. Yes. Okay. And what about when you're exercising? No. Okay. And the last thing is you mentioned that you noticed your heartbeat. Yeah. Again, how often do you get that? I, well, like it's maybe once a day, maybe more. There's one more thing that I think I should mention, like I do have some loss of libido at home. Okay. How long has that been happening for? Like the same amount of time really, like since I changed my job. Fine. And apart from all these things that you've told me, do you have any other medical problem problems? Well, I have a hypothyroid disorder. Okay, and do you take medications for that? Thyroxin. And are you remembering to take your medications? Yes. Okay, and do you drink or smoke? Yes. How much do you drink? Like once a week, a couple of glasses of wine. Okay, and what about smoking? No. And I need to ask this to all of my patients, but do you do anything else recreational in terms of drugs? Okay, so you've never taken cocaine or marijuana? No. Okay, thank you. And are you allergic to anything? No. Good. So you've told me a lot of things happening to you at the moment, and I can understand they probably feel quite strange and unusual. Yeah. I think the best course of action is you come and see one of our doctors in the clinic, yeah. We can give you an examination. And what that means is we check your heart and your breathing, yeah. to make sure that those things are functioning correctly. Yeah. And probably do some blood tests for your thyroxine. Yeah. And take it from there. How does that sound? That sounds very good. Thank you. I think before we give you any medications, we should see you in person. Okay. So what I'm going to do is book an appointment or I think you can book an appointment through the app to come and see us in the clinic. Yeah. See one of my colleagues. Yeah. I'll let them know what you've told me today so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said. Thank you. Great. Do you have any questions? Well, that was it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Yeah. Bye.
