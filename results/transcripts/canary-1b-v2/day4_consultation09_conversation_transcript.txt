Oh, hello. Hi. Hi, how are you doing? My name is Joe. I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? Yeah, doctor. Daniel. Hi, Daniel. And your date of birth? Yeah, may 11, 1992. 1992. Okay, Daniel. And are you in a comfortable and confidential place to talk? Yeah, totally. Happy to go ahead. Great. How can I help? Yeah, I just my chest has been feeling really tight. Okay. And how long has this been going on,, Daniel? For about three hours now. Okay. And so tight thighs for three hours. And so you were born in 1992, so that makes you 26. 26, yeah. And you're any shortness of breath at all with that? Yeah, like a little bit. Yeah, a little bit short of breath, not too bad. Any cough, whiff? Yeah, I'm feeling a little whiffy as well. This coffee, coughing, yeah. Yeah. Like cough, yeah. Yeah. Sore throat, runny nose, sore ears? You know, I had a cold last week and it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose, just feeling underwater. Do you feel better now, other than the tight chest? I mean, I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore. Right. Okay. Okay, but you know, now you've got this, so you still have, still have symptoms of a cold, essentially. Yeah, the cough's kind of stuck around. Yeah, okay. And are you coughing up anything? No. And do you have any other medical problems, like asthma? Yeah, yeah, I have asthma. I've had it for a while now. And then I have like a hay fever, you know, some allergies to dust and stuff like that. Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any medications? Yeah. So, you know the Ventalin, it's called salbutamol. Yeah. I got that one and then I have a steroid, Klenel, Klenel inhaler.? Phenyl modulate, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. And have you been using Phenyl and the Ventalin and how often have you been using them? Well, to be honest, I was away at uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me, so I haven't really in the past week. Both? Because, because, sorry, they ran out and I forgot to go and grab the next one. Yeah, sure. About a week ago. Okay. All right. So you don't have any Phenyl or any Ventalin at the moment? Not with me right now. No, I ran out. Okay., all right. And any drug allergies that you know of? No, no, not allergic to anything. Just like just the dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs. Okay, great. Now, does anyone in your family have any medical problems that you know of? Yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Oh, when I was young, I also had eczema. And I had a milk protein allergia when I was young too. Okay. Right, so just, uh, do you have any other kind of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or hopes for this consultation? Um, not really. Like, I feel like asthma is probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers would be helpful. Um, it's just kind of scary because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight, uh, in a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I can, I can imagine. Um, well, it certainly sounds like you've had this cold, you've got weezezy with a cough and it's nonproductive cough and you're short of breath. Is the cough worse at night? I mean, it gets a little worse at night, but basically just pretty consistent. Yeah. It hasn't gone away. Okay. And you've got this tight, tight chest, but you can't say you've got chest pain, it's more of a tight chest, is it? No, not really pain. It's more like tight. It just feels like sometimes you can't get a full breath in, you know? Yeah, sure. Okay. Well, I would quite like to, uh, certainly get you some ventilin, clinical modulate. Have you had asthma exacerpations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit more, like back in high school. But I've been pretty good at taking my inhalers, so not so much anymore. Have you ever been to hospital as a staypatient, as in, you know, stayed in there overnight for asthma? Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube under my throat. Oh, okay. So you, so you, you went to hospital and had a So you stayed in hospital for a few days, did you have an asthmama exacerpation? Yeah, I did. Yeah. Okay, but currently you're just on Ventalin and Clinol and you don't have any of those directors, those inhalers at the moment. I'd be pretty good. I'd be pretty good just on the Clinol and the Salbutamol. Okay. And when, sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerpation? I think I was like 17, 16 maybe? Sure. Okay. Just to quantify how short of breath you are, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you. No, you won't have, will you? Yeah. Are you able to like walk up flight of stairs okay, walk on the flat okay without getting too short of breath or are you short of breath at rest? I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like except for that feeling I was describing. It does when I'm walking up stairs, I do feel like I have a little more short of breath than I would normally be. Sure. Yeah, okay, but you're not short of breath at rest at the moment. No, no, I'm not. Okay, fine. So what I think, and just to go over, is there anything you had hoped about getting other than a prescription for your inhalers. Was there anything else that you hoped to get from this? Well, I just want to know that I'm okay to just keep I just don't want to have to get that intubation again. Sure. Yeah. No. Absolutely. Well, I'm really glad that you spoke to me today. I think what we can do is give you a prescription for some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within an hour, I would hope. And I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So these are tablets which you can take for five days, two tablets in the morning. And that should just dampen down your asthmatic response, okay? Okay. Now there are some side effects to the steroids, which I should really tell you about, but please read the label that's associated with them. Don't be too worried about the side effects. They're uncommon most, you know, most most most, most most most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated. And you probably have you had them in the past, do you know of? Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Have you had steroids in the past? I can't remember. Probably. Probably. Yeah. I would have had it. Yeah. They can come, they can make you, your mood change can be slightly low or slightly high, can give you a high blood sugar and they can also cause rash, nausea, headaches, but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help your asthma awful lot. What I'd like to do is send you these, some prescriptions for your inhalers are ongoing. So you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can use the Clinomodulate in the morning with Ventalin as a PRN, but so a ventalin when you need to, when you're getting crazy. If you should start using the ventalin more than every three hours at any time, it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So see a doctor in some capacity. And the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before? Yeah, yeah. Somebody taught me how to use one a while ago. I don't really use it, to be honest. Have you got one? I think I have one. I have one somewhere. Okay. All right. Well, I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside, breathing in and out for five or ten breaths. Okay. Yeah. So, was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage? I think you got me covered. Okay. And I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but I think I would advise you to just rest a little until you're feeling a little better, if you're okay with that. Okay. All right. Well, thank you very much. No worries. Any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath or just generally concerning symptoms, pain in your chest, tightness, feeling limp headed, then seek further medical attention any time, please. Okay. All right, sounds good. Okay, thank you. Great, thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.
