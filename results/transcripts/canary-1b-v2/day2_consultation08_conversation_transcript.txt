Hi, good morning. Hello there. Hi there, this is Dr. Dean Mizza from GP at Hand. Hello there. I'm wondering if you can help me today. Okay, sure I'll try. And before we start, can I please confirm your full name and date of birth? Yes, it's Sarah Smith and it's the 2nd of November 1992. That's great. Thank you, Sarah. So, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? I am indeed, yes. Okay. Okay, so tell me what's been going on. Okay, I've really not been feeling so well at all lately. I've been struggling with fever for the past week. Yeah, I would say it's started about seven days ago. I'm just I'm really hot and sweaty all the time and just generally not feeling good. Okay, all right, sorry to hear that. Now, along with this fever and this feeling hot and sweaty, any other symptoms at all? I'd say that I'm aching all over really. My muscles are really aching. I'mve not been able to eat very much and I have been drinking but it's been quite small amount. And yeah, just generally quite tired and unwell, and sweating during the night, and quite cold. Okay, all right. And so you're having periods when you're feeling hot and also periods when you're feeling cold as well. Yes, yeah, it's quite interchangeable, not really a pattern to it. Okay. And have you been taking any medication? I've been trying to take ibuprofen and paracetamol just from over the counter, but it's not really helping. I've just been taking the recommended dose every day of those. Sure. And when you say it's not helping, is it bringing the temperature down at all? Maybe slightly, yes, but I'm still experiencing these symptoms, so it it it takes the edge off it. Okay, all right. And can I just stop you, have you got any cough or cold or sore throat running or anything like that? Not those sort of symptoms really are you getting other than the ones you already mentioned to me? So I have it's mainly just the sweating really and the nausea that's taking over all day and the the the muscles all over. Sure. Have you had any ear pain at all? No, my ears are fine actually. I haven't had any problems with my ears. Okay. I just need to check for any other causes of infection in the body. So I'm going to go through some kind of systemic question. Have you had any diarrhea? Not really, no, I've been fine. Okay. Have you got any neck stiffness at all? No. Okay. Next, next, been fine. All right. Have you any headaches? Not more than usual, no. Just like the general headaches, but not just from staring at the screen and nothing, no. migraines or anything. Okay, so you know your normal headache, where is that? In the back of the head or the front of the head? It's quite centralized over the head. Okay, and how long have you been having that for? It's something that I've struggled with for years really just related to screen use or like changes in weather patterns. High pressure days sometimes I struggle with migraines and headaches. Okay, have you got any ration in your body anywhere at all? I haven't noticed any rashes, no. Are any joints swollen or tender or sore? Not really. I mean, I often have problems with back pain, but not really any other joints. Okay, all right. Any problems? All right. And have you got any kind of symptoms down below when you're passing urine? No, there has been no problems there. Okay. Any painful urination at all? Not at all, no. Are you passing your urine more often than normal? I don't think so, no, it's been fairly regular. Okay, have you been abroad anywhere recently? Yes, I have actually. Where have you been? I went to Vietnam, I came back four weeks ago now. Okay, and did you take malaria preventive medication when you went out there? I did, yes. Which one did you take? Oh, I can't remember now off the top of my head. Was it a weekly tablet or a daily tablet? I think it was daily. Okay. And was it one tablet or was there another that you would take on top of the first one? I think it was another that I took on top of the first one. Okay. And what were you doing out in Vietnam? Was it just staying in the cities or going through the villages or hiking? What kind of activities were you doing? It was quite mixed, really, because we were there for a few weeks and we toed several different parts of the country and the countryside and some cities as well. Okay. And did you do any kind of, were you in rivers or things like that? How adventurous were you? Sorry, could you repeat that? I missed that. Were you going out into the rivers? Were you going on beaches? I mean, how adventurous was your trip? Yes, it was quite adventurous. We were sort of trekking and cycling through farmland and seeing how people lived in their daily lives. lived in their daily life in farmland. Right, okay. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, do you have any other illnesses at all in the past? As I said, I've been struggling with back pain for quite a while, but I haven't really had any major illnesses in the past I can think of. And that back pain, have you seen anyone about that? Yes, yeah, I'm under a physiotherapist at the moment for that. Have they given you any kind of diagnosis at all? They said that it's related to long periods of time sitting at a desk and just a bad posture, so mainly the exercises are focused on improving posture and strength of the muscles in the back. Okay. Are there any illnesses in your family at all? The main one would be heart attack. My father passed away of that. So I think it was, yeah. Okay. Are you on any medication at all? Just Sarazette. Okay. Do you have any allergies at all to any medication? No, I'm just really pollen allergy, that's all I have. Okay, so hay fever. Yes, yeah, just hay fever. All right. Are you, you're working at the moment? I am, yes. What do you work as? I work as a nurse. Okay, all right. And are you up to date with all vaccinations, hepatitis B, that kind of thing? Yes, indeed, yeah. Okay. But I'm really struggling quite a lot of work at the moment. Sure. It's been quite difficult, feeling so tired all the time. Sure. Okay. And are you a smoker at all? No, I'm not. Okay. Okay, and do you drink much alcohol? Mm, moderate alcohol intake. I don't drink too much. And how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally? I try and do some moderate physical exercise a few times a week. Okay, that's good. All right. So what I think we're going to need to do is we're going to need to bring you to one of our clinics, examine. Okay. And we're going to need to arrange some blood tests as well. Okay. Okay. So what I want to do is the first question that I have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this fever and these symptoms, because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me. There's no when someone has got fever and sweats, we want to find out if they've got chest infection, have they got throat infection, and if we can't find a focus of infection, then that's something that's an outstanding question that needs to be answered. Okay? The second thing, the second factor is that you've recently come from Vietnam and you've had exposure in rural areas. And we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well. So you're probably going to need some blood tests after you've been seen by someone. Now, the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you, which is why we're going to go for the examination first. Okay. Come into one of our clinics in central London. That's one option. And then the GP there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be. Or if it's inconvenient for you to come into central London because you live in the city. Because you're living further out, you could actually just attend a local A and E. I'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of tests I think you need in the notes for this appointment. So you could show that to them at reception. I'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films to check for malaria and inflammatory markers and things like that. Technical terms, but they'll understand what I'm talking about. But I don't think you can go into work until we've sorted this out. And we need to sort this out sooner rather than later. Okay. Okay. That sounds great. Thank you so much for your help. I think, yeah, I can come straight into central London today to get that sorted. Okay, fine. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in. And if you can call the number that I leave in your consultation notes after a few minutes, and then they'll slot you in and then we can sort things out from there, okay? That's brilliant. Thank you very much. Okay then. Okay. Take care then. All the best. Goodbye.
