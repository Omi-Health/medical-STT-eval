Alex oh hello how can you hear me yeah okay great and how can I help you this morning sir I've been feeling I've been feeling kind of under the weather for the past four days it started with the sore throat and runny nose and it's sort of um it's sort of going into a cough now um the sore throat is kind of going away but um i'm starting to cough okay sorry to hear that kind of uh bad and tired hmm okay i'm sorry i think there's a lot going on there um so let's start with your your sore throat first tell me a bit more about that if you can um so I you know I think I it all started with the colleague of mine she just kept sneezing next to me all the time I think her kids are catching something from there from the kindergarten or something and you know that it it started as normal sore throat and it was quite painful for a couple days but then it was fast. Okay, did you have any difficulty or pain on swallowing? Yeah, it was quite painful to swallow for one of the days. Did you manage to have a look in the back of your throat in the mirror? No, not really. No, okay, you didn't notice any abnormal white spots, redness at the back of your throat? No, I didn't think about looking. That's okay, that's okay. And you mentioned a runny nose, again what kind of discharge is coming out, is it clear or is it a bit more coloured? Yeah, yeah, it's clear but sort of getting my nose stuffed all the time, it's very hard to get it free. Okay, so you feel quite congested, do you? Yeah, quite congested. Okay, fine. You also mentioned a cough as well. Can you tell me more about that? Yeah, that started recently, like just maybe yesterday. And it's dry for now. It not very painful but it sort of there all the time Okay and is it worse at any particular time of the day Sorry Is it worse at any particular time of the day For example in the evenings night time, mornings, or is it throughout the day? No it's sort of constant. I forgot to mention that I'm also having night sweats. Night sweats, okay. That's very odd actually and that makes me a bit tired and it makes my life a bit uneasy. I can imagine yes and this has again been going on for the last three or four days has it? Yeah yes. Okay, have you noticed any fevers or temperatures at all? I had some some fever in the beginning but it's now sort of going down. I've been taking some paracetamol and ibuprofen for that and they help. That's very sensible, very good. In terms of your chest otherwise have you any difficulty breathing or any pain in your chest? So no pain in chest but I noticed that I feel a bit winded on exertion so if I I haven't been going to the gym because of that. When you say winded, do you feel more shorter breath would you say on exertion? Yeah. Okay. And that's mainly on exercise but when you're resting there's no problem. Yeah, yeah. When I'm resting it's okay. So I've been actually going to work and sort of managing. Okay, fine. Just a couple other questions if you don't mind. any pain in your ears at all? No. You don't feel blocked or any discharge coming out of your ears? No I don't think so. Okay fine. What I'm gonna do I'm gonna run through a few yes no questions if you don't mind just a review of your systems. Any headaches at all? Yeah yeah that's still there. Whereabouts are the headaches? Just sort of general and they're not they're not always there but you know every now and then they would come and go Okay and with those headaches have you any problems with your eyesight your vision No Any difficulty with seeing bright lights No, I don't think so. No, okay. And just moving down now, in terms of any feeling of nausea or any vomiting? No, none of that. Okay. Tell me about your bowels. Are your bowels working okay? Yeah, yeah, I think so. And passing urine okay? yeah yeah how's your appetite sir yeah I've been I've been drinking a little bit more than the usual but so other than that okay and you're eating and drinking you're eating okay otherwise maybe a bit less than than what I would usually have okay have you noticed any funny rashes at all on your skin um no and any general muscle pain or aches joint pain yeah yeah that's that's sort of started in the past couple days yeah okay all right and just have a look at the rest of your history are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of so otherwise that I'm fine there's there isn't anything that I'm taking or I'm being treated for okay so you're otherwise fitting well any allergies at all to any medication that you should be aware of? No. Any family history at all so anything relevant in the family that I should be aware of thinking about diabetes, high blood pressure? Yeah my grandma has diabetes and my grandma. Do you say grandma? Sorry, my apologies. Grandma, okay. Do you know what type of diabetes it is? Is it type 1? I think it's type 2. Anything else that you think is significant? Yeah, I think one of my great grandad had an eczema. Excellent, okay. Just moving on to what we say is social history, just to get to know you a bit more as a person. Tell me, who do you live with at home? I live alone. Okay, and you said you're working at the moment, is that right? Yeah, yeah. What do you do for work? I an accountant Okay and how your work going at the moment Has it been affecting your work A little bit I been a bit slower and you know it a bit of a stressful period just around the end of the year. Okay is that stress affecting your mood at all in any way? No, I think it's the good kind of stress. It's good work. If there's anything you ever want to talk to me about, you can always come and see me, about your mood, stress, anxiety. We're happy to help. No, I like my job. It's just a bit more work than usual. Okay. And just very briefly, in terms of smoking, do you smoke at all? um yeah occasionally no cigars and things on company parties okay so not not regular um and what about alcohol um occasionally i would have some i'm not a very drinker again socially would work um okay um so um so just having listened to your story um uh really just to summarize you know it's the last four days you've been feeling generally quite unwell, sore throat, runny nose, bit of a dry cough, bit of muscle pain, weakness, had initial fever but now settled. I don't think there's a lot to worry about. I think you probably have a bit of a viral, what we say viral illness and maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection or maybe early signs of a flu. It normally lasts for about seven to ten days and just gets better really over time but things you can do to really help yourself is get plenty of rest i'll probably advise you taking a day or two of work if you can um making yourself you know pushing fluids and make yourself well hydrated continuing with the regular paracetamol and ibuprofen and and we should see how things go really um if next week is still a lot better i'd like you to come back and see me is that clear is that does that make something yeah that's that's it's all good it makes sense I think I think I'll take a couple days off yeah and things look out for if you're really not getting better if you have a high fever or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored or chest pain I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner give me a call yeah we can help you out that's okay yeah I understood I'll take care great have a great day good luck with your work thank you
