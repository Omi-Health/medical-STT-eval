Not really, but generally during work times. So it's normally at work? I'm at work, I'm in a meeting or on my laptop. Okay. And where does the headache sit in your head Is it the front or the back I can say Okay and does it go anywhere else Does it go anywhere else The headache No it mostly in the front and then yeah it kind of stays there. And when you have the headaches specifically do you know sick not really but it's like making it hard yeah kind of feel a little bit nauseous maybe okay and sometimes I also feel like yeah it's like maybe probably breathing or something okay and do you normally get headaches before all of this started? So no I feel like my health situation was mostly under control. Okay. And then let's... But it started roughly when I changed jobs. Okay so talk to me about your job, what do you do? I'm a lawyer. And do you work in London at the moment? Yes. So do you get these headaches on your commute into work? Not really, I get it mostly when I'm at work. Okay, and tell me about what you do. Do you sit in front of a computer most of the time, or do you speak to people? Like 50-50, I go to meetings and then sit in front of a computer. Okay. Just a lot of reading. And these things have happened mostly when you're sitting at your computer? Yeah, it happens then, yeah. Okay, and tell me what did you do before being a lawyer? No, I was a lawyer at a previous job as well. Okay, so talk to me about the stress that you're under at the moment. If 10 out of 10 is extremely stressful and 1 out of 10 is being on vacation where do you keep at the moment I think it 7 or eight And is that normal for you Yeah it like a law firm There's always pressure. Okay. So you mentioned your headaches. You also mentioned your reduced appetite, so you don't want to eat as much. Yeah. Have you lost weight? Yes. Can you remember how much you've lost? Five pounds. And is that because you're going to the gym or is that unintentional? It's not intentional, no. Okay. So have you noticed your clothes feeling looser? Not really. No. And have people said or commented that you've lost weight? No. Great. And another thing that you also mentioned is that you noticed tingling in your hand. Yeah. So talk to me about that. Is it in one hand or both hands? both and do you get that in your legs as well no and what does it feel like the tingling quick quickling and again is this the first time you've noticed this yeah okay and the other two things that I've just jotted down is you're feeling hot but you didn't mention that is that correct But like, I would say like, I guess it's like feeling of short of breath. Okay. Sometimes. So that could be what you were referring to. Yes. So do you feel short of breath while you're sitting at your desk? Yeah. No. Yes. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. And how about when you're exercising? No. Okay. and the last thing is you mentioned that you noticed your heart beating yeah again how often do you get that i i when i like it maybe once a day uh maybe more uh there one more thing that i think I should mention Like I do have like some loss of libido at home Okay. How long has that been happening for? Same amount of time really. Like since I changed my job. Fine. And apart from all of these things that you've told me, do you have any other medical problems? Well, I have a hypothyroidism. Okay, and do you take medications for that? Thyroxine. And are you remembering to take your medications? Yes. Okay, and do you drink or smoke? Yes. How much do you drink? Like once a week, a couple of glasses, a while. And how about smoking? No. And I need to ask this to all of my patients, but do you do anything else recreational in terms of drugs? No. Okay, so you've never taken cocaine or marijuana? No. Okay, thank you. And are you allergic to anything? No. Good. So you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment, and I can understand they probably feel quite strange and unusual. Yeah. I think the best course of action is you come and see one of our doctors in the clinic. Yeah. examination and what that means is we check your heart and your breathing yeah make sure that those things are functioning correctly yeah and probably do some blood tests for your thyroxine yeah and take it from there how does that sound that sounds very good thank you I think before we give you any medications we should see you in person okay so what we're going to do is book an appointment or I think you can book an appointment through the app to come and see us in the clinic and see one of my colleagues. I'll let them know what you've told me today so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said. Thank you. Great. Do you have any questions? No that was it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Bye.
