Hello? Hello. Can you hear me well? Yes, I think it's a bit better. It's a bit, it's a bit, it's not very clear, but let's continue anyway. Okay. Okay. Let's start again. So how can I help you, sir? Yes, so it's been a few days now. I have like a sore and red skin. It's kind of, it's really itchy and it's like super annoying. So I'd like to find something quick to solve it. No problem, I'm happy to help. Where about your skin is it affected? Mostly like my chest, my hands, my arms, like really it's super annoying. Like it's itching a lot, like all the time and I can't even sleep at night. I really need something quickly to solve it because even at work, when I'm in the meeting and I have to think about my work and focus, actually focus on my work, it's really annoying because I can't actually think about what I have to say. I'm always disturbed by this disease. No, no, okay. I understand this is obviously affecting you and we'll try our very best to get it sorted out for you. Have you had anything like this before in the past? and so yes earlier I was like prescribed for my eczema okay and they gave me like some cream and something to when I like was when I was in the shower I had to put something okay but did it help and I mean at that time yes but the symptoms like this in terms of like when the symptoms appeared again I tried those and it didn't work I've tried a few things like I bought like a steroid cream at the pharmacy last night but it apparently didn't help because it's still itching a lot today. Do you remember the name of the cream you bought? Steroid cream. Okay, would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different? It's much more like itchy and my eczema was more like only in the arms and now it's also on the chest and in the hands as well. Okay. Yeah like I like for instance hiking during the weekends and I can really do it anymore because it like very like like I wanted to that last weekend and it was super painful and I have to take like showers every day to be able to kind of ease this itching parts which is very very annoying no well okay that's okay so you mentioned the itchiness and you also mentioned it's been quite sore have you noticed any bleeding or discharge from your skin? No, so my skin is a bit cracked in some parts, like kind of cracked if you see what I mean. Okay, you don't have any other pus or blood coming out of your skin? No. And you mentioned it all started three days ago. Four days ago. Are you aware of any triggers, anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start? So for example, have you changed your shower gel, any clothing, have you been around anyone? No, it's actually like it's really annoying because I'm thinking about maybe I should change something because I haven't and I don't understand and I'm kind of afraid of asking people around me because it's kind of you know I don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions it's kind of intimate and so I'll your head now hmm no no okay that's okay fine so just to re-summarize for the last four days you've had very itchy skin very sore skin all over your body mainly your chest and did you mention your arms and legs as well and no just the chest hands and like like inside the elbows okay anything on your face at all in my what on your face on my face no no okay and And apart from this, any other symptoms have you noticed? For example, have you noticed any temperature or fevers? No, just the itching. Itching. Nothing else. Okay. So your bowels are working okay? Your chest is okay? No cough, no breathing difficulties? No. You're passing urine okay? I think so. Okay. All right. It's always good to know. So, I mean, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms Any what Any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms So I had eczema before so maybe it this but it seems like more like my eczema was only on the arm so I'm not sure I really have no idea. Okay, that's okay so normally at this stage I like to examine you to see the rash yourself and see exactly what type of rash it is but from what you've told me you mentioned it's you've got some dry skin and some cracked skin as well and it's been very itchy and so with your background of eczema, so there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you, my apologies, apart from the eczema do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? No I just had asthma in the past but not anymore. Not anymore okay and do you take any regular medications at the moment no no okay do you have any allergies to anything hello hello yes oh can you hear me I saw nothing it crack up do you have any allergies at all? Oh allergies no. No okay and tell me about your your situation at home who do you live with? So I live with a few flatmates and so you know I'm 31 I have a full-time job and so I'm living with people to save money. Okay and what you do for work? I work at a pharmaceutical company so it's been a few years now. It's kind of interesting we're working, I'm a kind of project manager, I mean do you want to know more about it? Okay no no no that's absolutely fine. Just a couple of questions I want to ask you which can sometimes affect your symptoms is do you smoke at all? No. No and do you drink much in the way of alcohol you know once in a while again I like hanging out with people once in a while so yeah I say a few a few beers per week something like this nothing nothing crazy I used to drink a lot more when I was younger but it been a while Okay I got to say at this stage I got to say the sound quality is not great but I will continue because we've come this far. So based on everything you mentioned sir, I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema, the reason being that you said it's quite itchy it's many affecting your chest and your back and having looked at your skin the rash does appear quite familiar you mentioned you using steroid creams yesterday from the pharmacy I wonder whether giving you stronger prescription of a steroid may be beneficial which I'm happy to prescribe to you today as well as I'm gonna give you something some emollients which helps to moisturize the skin, which you want to use in the bath and shower. And it's definitely worth using that for the first seven to ten days before we make a decision on whether it's working or not. It's also worth using antihistamines, which you can sometimes buy over the counter, things like loratidine or pyrotin, which can help the itchiness of your skin. and it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap because if that's causing your symptoms then we need to have a discussion about that next time I see you. Okay just I have tried antihistamines lately but it didn't really help. Oh could you say that again sorry? I have tried the antihistamines okay but it didn't okay so something for you to think about you can get different types of antihistamines I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well something like fixofenadine which I can give to you today it's definitely worth trying it's not going to do any harm but I say anything using the steroids and the emollients on a regular basis over the next week to 10 days should hopefully control your symptoms but do come back and see me next week if things don't get better that sounds good okay um do you have any questions for me uh no that's it okay well i wish you all the best thank you very much have a good day bye thank you
