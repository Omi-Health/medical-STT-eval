Hi. Hello, I'm Dr Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Hi. So just before we start, is it alright if you could confirm your name for me please? Yes, my name is Dr Jacob. And your date of birth? 14th of July 1996. And your address for me please? 28 Quicks Road SW191EZ. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Thank you. Okay so you mentioned in our notes that you've got some child's tightness if you could like to tell me a bit more about it please. Yeah so about two to three days ago I was running with a friend and usually I could talk to her whilst I ran but I found myself actually short of breath. I'm not really short of breath when I'm walking but definitely if I'm walking briskly now and I've used my blue inhaler but to no avail it hasn't really helps me. So I'm just wheezing a bit and coughing and just generally a bit short breath. Wheezing and coughing okay and you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler so how often are you using the blue inhaler? I think I'm just using that as and when I have symptoms. Yeah so at the moment you are having shortness of breath so are you using it every day at the moment? Yeah and morning and evening to kind of prevent it as well okay and which color what's the name of your preventer it's blue I think in totality my history is salbutamol clenyl cetraben and hydrocortisone that I taking as well okay so could you repeat that You have selbitum clenol Cetraben and hydrocortisone And hydrocortisone So you have eczema also yeah What's that sorry? You do have a history of eczema. My brother's asthmatic and my sister has eczema and I've got a few issues that I think could be eczema as well. Okay, right. So coming back to your shortness of breath, you've mentioned your wheezy and your coughing. Are you bringing up any phlegm at all? No, I'm not coughing up much sputum. Okay, no sputum. Okay. Right, Theo. And how are you using your clenol? So are you using it every day? I think I'm using that every day and the salbutamol is just like as and when. So how are you using the clenol? Is it twice a day? Yes. Twice a day. Okay. And have you ever been admitted in hospital because your asthma was so bad? No, I haven't. Okay. Right. When was the last time you had an asthma attack? About three to four years ago. Three to four years ago. And what did the DP do at that time? Just encouraged me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative. Okay, so you didn't have any steroids or antibiotics? Not that I can remember. Okay Have you ever had oral steroids in the past No When was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse About two years ago Okay, two years ago. But your asthma was pretty under control till now, isn't it? Yes, just in the last two times. So do you do a peak flow meter at home? Peak flow reading where you blow into, you know, do you do that, no? Just every now and then. I haven't done it over the last, since I've had symptoms. Okay, so what was your peak flow reading when you're good? Like normally peak flow reading? I think 130. Okay, let's say it's about 380. Yeah? Yeah. Okay, right. So that's your normal, yeah? Right here. Okay, so what we need... Okay, do you have any allergies at all? I have hay fever. Sorry, could you repeat that, please? Sorry, I have hay fever. Okay, no, no, any allergies to medication? Oh no, I'm sorry. Okay, so you're not allergic to anything. Okay, so no allergies. Okay, excellent. Right here. So what we need to do that, obviously, you haven't had an asthma check for some time, and it looks like you can be having a small exacerbation. So what I would like you to be seen by one of our GPs in the next few days in the interim what I like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when okay and use it maximum about every two to four four hours but if you using it that often that means pretty much that you know your asthma is really bad you can use it but that's not ideal the blue the brown in your clenol the brown inhaler you can up the dose if you're using just just two puffs twice a day, you can increase it to four puffs twice a day. Yeah. And while this is to do while you're waiting to see us. Now, as you mentioned, you know, you're doing what, you know, increase the clenol to four puffs twice a day. And you're using the asthma, you know, the blue inhalers every two to four hours. And your breathing is getting really worse. Then you would need to take yourself to A&E. shouldn't wait for our appointment okay so when the doctor sees you what we're going to do is we're going to examine your chest yeah make you do the pizza reading so depending on what we find you might need some antibiotics or some steroids but anyway while you're at home we are going in by increasing your clenol we are increasing your steroid intake anyway okay so yeah so any questions you wanted to ask me? Yeah so call support, book an appointment you see and I will recommend that you do the face to face. In the interim increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly but if your breathing's getting worse and you've not seen it do take your puff to A&E. All right? Okay thank you you so much for your time you're welcome take care then bye bye
