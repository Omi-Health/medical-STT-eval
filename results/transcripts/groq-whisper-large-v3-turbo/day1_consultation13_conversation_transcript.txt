There's no delays. Hello. Hi there. Hello there. Thanks for being here. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Yes, it's Adriana Katronjieva, and I'm 26-year-old. Okay, Adriana, how can I help you this afternoon? Well, I have this really crazy headache that's been going on for a few days, and it really annoys me. Oh dear, okay. When did it exactly start, this headache? Around three days ago, maybe. Three days ago, okay. And where about in your head is this pain? It's basically like, it kind of feels all over my head, but like mainly around my right eye. Okay. And is a headache there all the time or does it come and go? It kind of comes and goes. I mean it is there all the time but sometimes it's stronger. Okay, so it comes in fine. Okay. And if I was to ask you on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 would be the worst type of pain you ever had, how would you rate this headache? It's probably an 8. Okay. And if I was to ask you to describe the headache to me in terms of the nature of pain is it sharp is it dull is it crampy is it throbbing um it's kind of it's dull but sometimes it gets a bit sharper so basically it like it developed gradually i guess it's like the first day it just started when i was at work and by the end of the day it was like pretty pretty like it was a lot basically and then i was thinking okay maybe i'll just go to sleep and then i woke up the next morning like it was even even worse basically so you think the headache is getting worse at the last three days yeah okay have you tried anything which has made a headache better um so i tried uh ibuprofen um so i took like a few um for the last two days basically but it doesn't really help no and in the past it did help me which is why i decided to try it but okay And except for headaches, any other symptoms at all? So for example any problems with your eyesight or your vision Not really but just when it started I got this like weird shooting lights and like now like light is quite annoying my eyes. So when you say annoying does it hurt to look at bright lights? Yeah yeah it hurts. Okay and have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision? Not loss of vision I wouldn't say it's just like some lights from shooting lights. Any nausea or any vomiting? Well like basically I'm sick with the headache but I no vomiting. When you say sick you mean you feel sick okay yeah no vomiting okay any neck pain or neck stiffness no okay any difficulty with speaking or speed no any difficulty with weakness in your arms and legs no it's hard to focus though so I had to take a couple of days off work actually really okay okay well I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on and any recent head injuries at all No. Okay and have you had anything like this before in the past? Yeah I mean headaches you mean. Or similar to this kind of headache? Yeah I mean I had but usually after I take ibuprofen it kind of goes away so but this time it's just not. Okay don't worry um any temperatures or fevers no any rashes at all on your skin no no that i've noticed okay and just moving forward are you otherwise fit and well adriana am i what sorry you're fitting well do you have any other medical history i think so it's just a headache any history of migraines at all not myself i've never had a migraine but my sister and my mum have them uh quite frequently. Okay, I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask, do you take any regular medication? No. Are you on the pill? No. Okay, do you have any allergies to medications? Not that I know of. Okay, so you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines yeah are they is that normally well controlled or are they having difficulty controlling their symptoms So my sister like better like it kind of very rare but my mom is like quite bad usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that, yeah, it takes her out for a few days basically. Okay, fine. Socially, tell me a bit more about your life outside of work. Who lives at home with you? I live with housemates, so three of them. Excellent. And are you working at the moment? You mentioned this impact on your work. Yeah, so I work in IT, so I work with computers a lot, so it kind of is difficult to focus. I had to like reduce the brightness of my screen. Do you wear glasses? Yes I do. Have you had any recent eye check done, eye tests? No, I've been wearing them since I was five year old. Okay, for you to bear in mind if you feel like your eyes are straining, I always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Have you been more stressed or anxious at work recently? Well, it's been a bit stressful kicking off a new project but yeah nothing out of the ordinary really. Okay, all right, great. Regarding smoking or alcohol do you drink or smoke at all? I socially smoke and I drink not only socially. Only socially. okay right now um adriana do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms have you have you read anything online or spoken to people um not really um i for the first i thought it's stress or maybe i didn't drink enough water because sometimes when i don't drink enough water I get headaches, but I don't think that's it. And I'm like worried. I don't want it to be a migraine because I know what it's like for my mom and my sister. And it's really annoying. So I really don't want to have that. And I know it's genetic. So I've researched that. But I don't know if that is the case. So yeah. Is it anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today? Yeah maybe just kind of if you have any recommendations of I can take something stronger because apparently ibuprofen doesn help me usually it gets resolved if I have headache and like after like one or two days but currently it didn help me how many tablets did you take of ibuprofen? three a day three a day okay all right so Adriana so really what I think is going on here I unfortunately I do think this could be a headache very similar to migraine. The reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it given your mum and your sister also have migraines. I think it's something for us to think about. Now I'm not saying it's going to keep happening but it may just be a one-off but it's only worth treating it today with some stronger analgesia or painkillers. Now moving forward we have some options which we can discuss uh you try the ibuprofen now my only worry is i'm not sure whether you're taking the correct dose you can take up to two tablets three times a day oh right there's definitely room for improvement there or i can prescribe you something stronger like naproxen which is another anti-inflammatory which can be helpful we can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or codeine which might be helpful as well yeah i think protein is what my mom takes for when she has um migraines okay i think it's only worth making sure i can give you a prescription for that today um with regards to um the next few days it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's you know if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse and you know like you come back and see me in about a week's time week to two weeks time if you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches we can think about giving you medications as prophylactic which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis but we can have that discussion next time. Okay. Okay. In the meantime, if your headaches aren't getting any better or they're getting worse, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner. Okay? Okay. If you have any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs or you're just not feeling very well, just give me a call and come back and see me. Okay. All right. Great. Great. Well, have a good day. Thank you. You too. Bye. Bye.
