Interesting. Ah. Hello. Hello. Hi. My name is Dr. Kumar, one of the GPs here. Can I just get you to confirm your name and date of birth for me, please? Yeah, I'm Maria. Yeah. Date of birth? Sorry? And your date of birth? 27th of March of 90. Again, how can I help today? So I'm having like a really, really strong headache. I don't know what is happening. I'm quite concerned. So it started in the morning. I feel like dizzy. My vision is a little bit blurry. Like it's really painful. and I'm getting really concerned, especially because I'm having like these changes in the vision. So it started this morning, was it a sudden onset headache? Did it come on suddenly? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And did it come on really bad or did it start off like a slight headache and build up to a severe headache? It came like kind of suddenly. And if 10 is the worst pain you've ever felt your life how bad would you say the pain was between one and ten well I had the kidney stone so let's say that that's ten I have now maybe five well six six probably it's not ten but it's more about me being really concerned because this is very weird okay no that's fine have you ever had a headache before Sorry? Have you ever had a headache like this in the past? Well, not really. Like this? Yeah, like this? No, definitely. It's something new. Okay. If you had to say where across the head the headache is, is it across the front, around the back? It's in one side, the left side only. And tell me, what visual problems are you getting? My vision is quite blurry It really weird like some zigzag lines Okay kind of I don know how to describe it properly Okay and have you tried any painkillers for this already Yeah, I tried paracetamol but it didn't work. To be honest, I feel exactly the same. Okay, what time did you take the paracetamol? How long ago was it you taking it? Well, the headache started like four hours ago, so I would say like maybe three hours ago because I couldn't stand it. Okay. And your visual problems are still ongoing now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel a little bit better, I cannot stand screens. But yeah, definitely. And when I move, the thing is that if I leave bed, I start to feel even worse if I move. So I just want to have my head really not moving. Okay. Okay. So what about, have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit? Oh, yeah. Oh, I forgot to mention, definitely, I vomit twice. Actually, as soon as the headache started, I also vomited. So initially I thought it was something that I ate, but then the headache started to be really bad and I still feel nausea. To be honest, I'm about to vomit very soon, I think. All right, okay. You've mentioned in the past you've had kidney stones. Any other medical problems? Sorry? You've mentioned that in the past you've had kidney stones. Have you had any other medical problems in the past? So not actually. My mother has migraines. I'm not sure if that's relevant. And also I have hypothyroidism in the family. So it might be, I don't know. I don't know. What else do you have in the family? I think we are losing connection. Sorry, I think we lost connection. Can you still hear me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can hear me. You said, you mentioned your mother has migraines. What else do you have in the family? Hypotheirid. Hypotheirid. She also has hypotheiridism. Okay, fine. Okay. And no other relevant family history? No, not that I'm aware. And do you take any regular medications No Are you allergic to any medications Not that I aware Yeah not that I aware Okay Is there any chance you could be pregnant I really doubt it Fine. And so you're not allergic to any medications. Fine. And what were you thinking might be going on? I know you seem quite worried about it. Was there anything in particular you were worried about? out well I'm a little bit hypochondriac so I feel that this can be some kind of brain tumor tumor or something because I'm like this is really the pain is so horrible that or maybe a stroke I don't know it's it's just like you know you hear so many stories that you definitely start wonder if I should go to any urgently because I might really have something serious okay okay now just another question have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs anything like that no no no no and when you're walking you're able to walk fine in a straight line or is your your walk are you walking a bit funny not really okay it's really about the head that's why I find it very weird okay so just just to clarify what you said this morning you woke up and then later on the in the morning about four hours ago you've developed a headache on the left side of the head yeah left side of the head exactly behind the eye sorry is it behind the eye is that where the pain is no no it's I don't know how to describe it but it's just okay that's fine you've noticed that your vision is blurry there's funny lines you feel a bit nauseous you vomited twice yes you're feeling dizzy as well but you're you've got no neurological symptoms you're walking fine and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped no okay yeah so it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine is that something you've heard of before no it's the first time okay but i'm very familiar with the disease because my mother has it so uh well but i never had it and i thought that the onset of migraine will be you know in much early ages so that why i not sure if migraine makes sense okay so um usually with migraines they can present at different times in people lives so sometimes they can present as a child sometimes they can present when they're older and sometimes they can present you know even post-menopausally. So there's different there's different ways you can get migraines and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head, typical of a migraine, you've got blurry vision again which is very typical with the nausea and vomiting that's also typical of a migraine now um the obviously if the headache is really severe and i'll suggest some medications you can try if that doesn't work we would want to see you and as soon as possible to do like a full neurological exam as well oh that's great to make sure that you know there's you know when we do a more specific examination that everything all seems fine um i would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you, it can take some medications, maybe something like ibuprofen. Okay, so and you're saying that if this is a migraine and if I try that medication, this should go away kind of today? So yes, a migraine, yeah, not, you know, even sooner than that, we can look at maybe half an hour to 40 minutes, depending on what your response to it is. For some people, whatever medications they take, the migraine doesn't improve and it can last from anywhere from four hours to 72 hours migraines can last um but i would okay that doesn't sound no so what there's lots of medication treatments so there can be ibuprofen with an anti-sickness um so and which you can get from the pharmacy um and you also to drink a sugary um carbonated drink something like coke okay so the three of them is a good sort of cocktail to start them then we can go up the treatment ladder you can get specific micro relief medication and that's just something to try between now and when we see you to do the um to do the assessment okay sounds assessment where we could see you today at some point okay um but however if you do take these medications and you know by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself you can cancel it um you can give us a call and cancel it okay sounds good yeah Any questions for me? No, thank you very much. You were very helpful. All right, okay. Any further problems between now and your appointment, please do let us know. Okay, yeah. Thank you very much. Okay, bye. Bye.
