Right, okay. I'm not sure what that means. Okay, all right. It might all be connected then. And yesterday before this, all of this, were you completely fine? Yeah, yeah, kind of. I sort of feel my heart beating, but other than that, no, sort of fine. Okay, so you can feel your heart beating a bit faster than normal? I don't know, I can just sort of feel it more. But I've also been feeling a bit tired at work, exercising has been a bit difficult because I've been feeling tired. Performing daily activities has been a bit harder than usual. Okay, alright. And how long has that been for, the tiredness and not wanting to exercise? Only after, only for a couple of weeks or so. A couple of weeks okay And then the last day or so that when you get the cough and the pain in the side and you coughed in blood Yes Okay alright You said you felt a bit warmer Have you measured your temperature at all With the back of my hand yes Just for a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit. Okay, all right. Okay, and now can I just ask, do you smoke at all? No. Okay, what do you work as? I work in an office, just a desk job. Okay, all right. And do you live alone? yes yeah in a flat or house okay do you have any pets cats a cat okay are you on any medication at all regular medication yeah methotrexate okay what are you on that for I've got SLE SLE okay do you have any other diagnosis any other illnesses at all no Right, okay. And do you have any allergies to any medication? No. Any other allergies at all? No. Okay. So you're taking methotrexate at the moment. When was the last time you had methotrexate? This morning. You had it this morning. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. A couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and get an idea of how unwell you are. okay the first thing I'd like to do is to try and measure your pulse so the way we're going to do this is that if you if I can get you to try and locate the pulse in your wrist not everyone can do this so don't worry if you can't but if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse it's just under the thumb put your fingers up and down like that you might be able to feel the pulse I've got it you've got it okay you sure yeah all right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting okay so I'll just get my stopwatch up okay so if you can you've still got the pulse yeah okay so if you can start counting now please three five six seven eight nine ten seven if you can stop now i think that was about 11 or 12 um so that would make your heart rate about 66 to 74 that that okay good Fantastic And the next thing I like you to try and do okay it depends on the lighting so it may not be possible, but the next thing I'd like to try and do is just to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger and then let me see how quickly the redness comes back. Okay, so if you can see what I'm doing now, my fingers come right behind the screen. I'm squeezing it okay just watch me first yeah I'm squeezing it and then you can see that it goes pale and then it goes back to the normal red color okay so if I can get you just to put your finger up to the your camera and then with the other hand just try and squeeze it and you've got very good circulation okay perfect that's great thank you so much the last thing I'd like to do is I'd like to try and have a look down your throat okay are you doing this consultation via a phone or a laptop phone rested it on my laptop so I think we're good to go so say that again okay so if you if you position your device up above your head put your head back mouth open wide and let me see if I can that's perfect thank you for that excellent okay the last thing is if I can get you to feel inside your neck just on the sides here okay by your Adam's Apple tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not no I feel pretty normal to me okay I think all right now sorry I've forgotten your name Doris Doris and so Doris what I think we need to do is this sounds like you might have a chest infection okay if you're coughing up blood and you're feeling your heart racing I think you need to be examined today someone need to listen to your chest and maybe check your blood pressure as well check that you're stable I have to say examining you now from what limited examination I could do online your everything does seem to be okay in terms of you don't seem acutely unstable however if you've got this kind of pain when taking a deep breath in you coughing up blood we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have pneumonia or chest infection And that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope And you may need an antibiotic This is one thing I need to ask you Have you been on any long-haul flight recently? No. No. Okay. Have you ever had any clots in your legs or clots in your blood clots? Not that I know of, no. No, okay. Anyone in the family have that? No. No, okay. All right. What I think we'll do is we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today. I would like someone to listen to your chest and to check your blood pressure and to recheck your pulse as well. Just check your temperature. Make sure all those parameters are okay. You may well need an antibiotic. Do you have any allergies to any antibiotics? No. Okay. I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now because I think you need to have that basic assessment first before we proceed to the next step. But that's what I would predict the next step might be. I'm going to leave a number in the notes for this appointment for you to ring our support team and then they will book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs today. And then they'll do that assessment and then we'll take it from there, OK? But we don't think I'm dying of lung cancer. Given the way in which you have presented now, just one day with the fever and this slight pain, concurrent with the blood and the phlegm, that's not usually how lung cancer is present. They're more insidious over a longer period of time with other symptoms. However, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding that we see you. Okay. Are you worried about lung cancer? Well, you know, you start coughing up blood and you think you're going to die of lung cancer. Of course, yeah. So just remind me how old you are again. I'm sorry. 45. 45 okay it's something we do need to be cognizant of okay and we may end up having to do a follow-up chest x-ray things don't settle down but at the moment it seems more like a chest infection rather than a lung cancer. That's good to know. Yeah that is good to know yes because that's easier to treat but we still need to make sure that things are okay because chest infections can become nasty as well it can need to infection inside the body we want to avoid that as well so let's get you checked out today and hopefully we can put your mind to rest and get you on the right course of treatment. Perfect. Thank you very much. All right. You're welcome. All right. Take care then. All the best. Bye.
