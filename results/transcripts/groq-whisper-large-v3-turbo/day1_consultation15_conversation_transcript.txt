Hello? Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Yes. Great, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Yes, I'm Laura Parkinson, and I'm 45. 45, all right, Laura, well, how can I help you this afternoon? Yeah, so I have soreness in my fingers, and my finger, like the skin on my hands is kind of cracked. Okay, when did this all start? A couple of months ago, like three, four months ago. Okay, so it's been that long, has it? Yeah. Okay, and so you mentioned your, is it the skin on your hands mainly that's dry? Yeah, I haven't noticed. I mean, I have dryness, like, you know, in other parts, like my legs, but it's not it's not very it's not severe it's just you know I've always you know I don't hydrate very much so right okay yeah like it's very bad in my hands okay can I ask why have you come to see me today is it because it's got worse recently your symptoms yeah I mean it's gotten to a point where where it hurts a lot and I can't really do my job so I thought I should probably get it checked out. Yeah that sounds like a very sensible plan. Which part of your hands are affected mainly? The palm. Okay alright. Do you notice any itchiness in your palms? Yeah it's itchy, not all the time but yeah it does get itchy. Okay any bleeding at all? I don't, I mean, no I don't think so. Are you scratching yourself often and bleeding? Yeah I guess when I scratch it yes it has bled sometimes but yeah otherwise it hasn bled on its own Okay Fine Okay sorry I just going to write notes as we go along And you mentioned the skin is quite cracked as well, is that right? Yes, that's right. Okay, alright. I know it's a long time ago, but do you remember how it all started? What were you doing at the time when it all started? Is there anything you may have done to bring your symptoms on? I do work as a housekeeper and to be honest I'm not always very good about wearing gloves so that could be related. I switched jobs four months ago. I've been working as a housekeeper for a while though but that's the only thing I can think of. Yeah I think that might be quite important actually, I think there's definitely a correlation between the two. So you mentioned something about having general dryness, you mentioned your legs as well? Yeah, sorry. Is that something you've had for a while now? Yeah it's not really major, yeah it's just a little bit of dryness in my legs. Right okay. I'm just gonna ask you some very brief yes or no questions if that's okay. With your symptoms have you have yet any other symptoms such as fever or temperatures any nausea or any vomiting any problems with your bowels no any problems with your urine water works otherwise you feel well do you in yourself you're eating drinking your appetite is well maintained yeah okay all right fine um in terms of your past medical history you have any other conditions at all I have diabetes do you know that type 1 or type 2 diabetes okay anything else No Any skin problems No Eczema, dermatitis for example? No, but I know of. No, I haven't been diagnosed. Okay. Which medications do you take? Bedformin. Bedformin, okay. Do you have any allergies either to any medications or in general? okay family history wise is there anything I should be aware of diabetes as well diabetes as well okay again any skin problems no any history of asthma or bowel problems no no okay all right Alright. In terms of social history, you mentioned that you work as a housekeeper and you're not always very good at wearing gloves. You recently changed jobs. Which kind of places do you work in? Is it mainly residential or is it commercial? It's a hotel. I do the whole thing like bedrooms, bathrooms, withers. Do you think there might be a relationship between the two, between the kind of the products you're using and your symptoms? Yeah I usually use both for bathrooms but yeah bedrooms and corridors not always. Okay have your symptoms stopped you from doing any work? Have you had to take time off work recently? Yeah like the past three days I haven't been able to go to Okay, alright. Can I ask a couple of questions? Do you smoke at all? No. Do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Pints a week. Once a week? A couple of pints a week. A couple of pints a week, okay. So very minimal alcohol there. Have you tried anything for your symptoms Have you tried anything over the counter any creams Yeah I tried E45 Any luck with that Yeah, no, it didn't really do anything. No, okay, alright. I also tried anti-histamine, but it didn't. Okay, alright. is Parkinson's so I think based on your story I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis which is very common in particularly people in your field who are using cleaning products not using gloves you can sometimes get a bit of a reaction between the chemicals and your skin and moving forward there's a couple of options so firstly what we try and do is you know avoid the triggers in your case I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times. In terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin, we can try some steroid creams to help with inflammation as well as some stronger emollients which you really need to kind of coat on throughout the day three four times a day for the next couple of weeks just to help with the moisturizing of your skin. If it still hasn't got better in about a week to two weeks time I really want you to come back and see me again and we can maybe think about other things we can give to you. Is that all clear? Yeah that sounds good. Great do you have any questions for me? Where do I get the medicines from? I'll do a prescription for you now and send it over to your pharmacy. Okay great yeah so you said a couple of weeks it should get better right? I think a minimum couple of weeks, 10 days to 14 days. And if it still hasn't got better, or indeed if it's getting worse, if it's spreading or dryness is getting worse, come back and see me sooner. Okay. Great. Thank you, Laura. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much. Bye-bye now. Bye.
