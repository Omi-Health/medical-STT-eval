Hello. Hi there, I'm Dr Dean Meza from Babylon. Good morning. Good morning. Sorry, before we start, could I get your full name and date of birth? Is that possible? Yeah, sure. My name is Juan Do and I'm 27 years old. So I was born in 1991, 17th of November. That's perfect. Thank you for that. Are you, John, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yeah. Perfect thank you for that. Okay so tell me what the problem is you've been having some difficulty breathing is that correct? Yeah exactly I've I'm kind of struggling to breathe at the moment I I got stung by a wasp recently well I'm not sure whether it's kind of bitten or stung but I I'm feeling like slightly anxious that there's a bit of I've got bit of a rash on my arm where i got stung and and i kind of yeah as i said i've got this difficulty breathing and potentially um there's a bit of swelling in my lips and tongue feels a bit weird right okay so when did this bee sting or bee bite occur um it was just a few minutes ago right okay um and your your lips don't seem swollen to me right now but do they which can Can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen? Yeah, it's just kind of on the right hand side. And it's just a bit sore. Maybe it hasn't really swollen up yet. OK. You said you've been having some difficulty breathing. Yeah. Your breathing seems all right to me right now. The reason why I'm clarifying this is because we have to decide whether this is an acute emergency, whether I need to send you into hospital straight away, or whether there's more time to ask questions. So do you feel that you've got difficulty breathing right now, this minute as we speak? I don't feel like it's particularly acute, but I'm just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a bit worse. I just wanted to speak to someone. Sure, you did the right thing. And I can understand it. It is quite anxiety provoking. Okay. All right. Can I just double check before we carry on asking any other questions? Have you got a history of anaphylaxis? Not that I know of. No. Okay. Have you ever been given an EpiPen? I haven no Okay all right let take a step back now so in terms of the bee singers did you see the bee or you just assuming it was a bee um i i i find it difficult to tell the difference between a bee and a wasp but um one of the two yeah it was one of the two okay okay and um the area of your body that stung where was it do you say it was your arm yeah it was on my arm all right and you've got a rash there can i have a look Yeah sure, it's just there. Okay, all right. That looks okay to me right now. Does it look red to you at the moment? It's slightly red, yeah, and kind of there's a bit of a hole where I think that the... Yeah, yeah, the puncture mark. Yeah, okay, all right. Now is there any swelling around that area that you can see? I couldn't see any. Not particularly, I guess it's just a bit kind of blotchy and a bit of a rash. It doesn't feel like particularly swollen. Sure, okay, all right. Now, have you taken any medications? You probably haven't because it was a few minutes ago, but have you not taken any antihistamines or anything like that? Not at the moment, no, nothing, nothing, yeah. Okay, now if I can just go back, do you have any history of any kind of illnesses at all? I've had eczema before. That's kind of the major thing, nothing. Have you got a history of any allergies to anything? I'm allergic to penicillin. Alright, good. And in your family, is there any history of any illnesses or any history of any kind of acute... Not that I think is particularly relevant, no. I don't have any. Right and do you have allergies to any kind of cats or dogs or pets or anything like that? Not that I know of. Yeah I've been around dogs and cats. And you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware? No. Okay. Can I ask, do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks or anything like that? Yeah sometimes, occasionally Right okay have you ever been on medication for that No Great now I need to ask a few questions maybe not directly related to this but just for general information purposes So are you working at the moment Yes. What do you work as? I am a computer scientist. Okay. And are you living alone? Yes. Okay. Do you have any pets at home? I have a cat. Okay. Great. What I'd like to do now, if that's okay John, is I'd like to have a look inside your mouth, okay? One of the things that we'd be worried about if someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction is to see whether there's any swelling of the lips or tissues inside the mouth, or the soft tissues of the airway. And I've got a fairly good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put your head back, mouth open wide, sit somewhere where there's good lighting, and I just want to have a look inside the throat, if that's okay. Perfect, okay, great. Now, can I just get you to do it again? Yeah. Just say, ah, this time? Ah. Okay, fantastic, brilliant. Okay. John, based on how you look, how you're talking to me, how you're breathing, and the appearance and your wrist. I don't feel that you're having a life-threatening allergic reaction. Now, it's very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite. It's a localized inflammatory reaction that is normal, and that immediate reaction, that redness and that maybe slight swelling, is usually temporary. What we're worried about is when someone has compromise of their breathing. So you mentioned breathing difficulties and the image of swelling in your lip. Thankfully I can't see any of that right now, but that's the most urgent and most pressing thing that we'll be watching out for. Given that it hasn't happened initially, it's unlikely to happen later. Okay, so we have like a stage one, a stage two reaction for these types of bites and usually if you're gonna have their reaction it will happens straight away. So we may be coming out of the danger zone now, but I'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens. So for example, you would have swelling of the lips difficulty breathing you might have something called stridor which is an inspiratory sound that when you trying to breathe it makes like a Rasmus sound like this Okay Thankfully, you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me like this is a localized allergic reaction. However, if anything changes, if anything deteriorates, either make an appointment with us or go straight to A&E. And in some cases, if it's progressing rapidly, it's better to go straight to A&E rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us. Okay. What I'd like you to do now is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines. So you can buy them with the counter. You can get puritan or chlorphenamine. And you can take one tablet, four milligrams, up to about six times a day. Or you can just take a one a day one. Whichever is your preference, that's absolutely fine. There's no issue. That should be enough to control this. If the redness in your arm spreads and it feels hot or you have signs of any localized infection, we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic and like I said if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing that's open and we need to process that if someone actually needs to be taken urgently. Did you have any other queries or was there anything else that you were worried about? No I think I think that kind of that makes me feel a bit better I guess can I get that can I get the anti-histamine from any shop or like pharmacy yeah any of the counter you don't need to any chemist will have it you don't need it yeah it's probably cheaper to buy over the counter actually then to get it by prescription okay okay now on the basis of what you told me I don't think you need any allergy testing I think this is just a straightforward localized reaction to an insect bite however if it was to happen that you know this you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or or other nonspecific rashes, you might need to think about blood testing. I don't think we're at that moment yet, okay? So, but that's something to bear in mind in case it becomes a recurrent pattern. Okay. Okay, so we'll leave it like that for now. Okay, I'm gonna leave you to some information about anaphylactic reactions, just for you to read about it. I don't need to panic, but just for you to be aware of what the symptoms are. If those kind of things happen, get back to us. If you're feeling worried, just have a low threshold for having a chat with us. Sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down. Okay, great. Yeah, that makes sense. All right then, John. Okay. We'll leave it at that. Come back to us if you have any further issues. Okay, thanks. I appreciate your time. My pleasure. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye-bye.
