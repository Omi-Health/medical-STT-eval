Hi there, good morning. I'm Dr Dean Mirza from Babylon. Can you hear me okay? Can you hear me fine? Okay great. Well nice to see you this morning. Before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth please? Yeah, Jack Smith, 31st October 1990. That's perfect, thank you Jack. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? at the moment? I am yes. Okay great so tell me what's been going on you've been saying there's a problem with your hearing is that right? Yes I just feel like I can't really hear as well as I used to like my hearing's kind of deteriorating in some way. Right okay how long has this been going on for? About six weeks. Six weeks okay and before that have you had any hearing problem at all? I had something maybe about a year ago but it only lasted a couple of days it wasn't anything as long as this. Right okay okay and in this six week period have you had anything else happen? Have you had any other ear symptoms at all? I occasionally get like a ringing in my left ear just on the one side and there's actually been a few times when I felt kind of a bit sick or a bit dizzy as well Right okay and just to clarify the difficulty you got in hearing is that both ears or just the left ear Just the left ear Alright so your right ear is fine It seems to be yeah Okay so you had ringing difficulty hearing in your left ear and feeling slightly sick and that's been on and off for the six weeks or is it continuous throughout that six weeks? It's kind of on and off like some things trigger it as well so for example if I'm watching TV or listen to music or something that will set off the ringing of the ear. Right okay and have you had any pain from the ear at all? No. Okay any discharge coming out of the ear? No. Okay have you been experiencing any fever? Not specifically apart from the dizziness and sickness I mentioned before. Right okay and has your ear been itchy at all? No. Okay now do you use cotton wool buds to try and clean out wax from your ears? No, I don't know. No, okay, well you're right, we shouldn't be doing that, it doesn't clean up the wax, it pushes it back in. All right, the first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear, okay, and just exclude the simple things. Simple things might be wax, you know, someone might have impacted wax, blocking the tube going into the ear drum, which can lead to muffle hearing. If that's the case that something that easily fixable But so we need to exclude that first and And then after that we can consider other potential possibilities And for that we need to have a look inside the eardrum So what I think we could do is maybe if we book you in for a face appointment in one of our clinics It's not an emergency. It can be done within the next four or five days or so. And then what I'll do is I'll send a message to our admin team. I'll ask them to slot you in a clinic, one of our clinics, in that time frame. you can come in and one of the GPs just have a quick look down the ear figure out whether there's a physical blockage or whether there's something else going on can I just double check the dizziness that you've been getting how severe is it? nothing major it's just kind of it's the kind of dizziness you get with nausea not proper room spinning or anything like that but just a little bit kind of off balance right have you had any chest pain with it? no no palpitations heart beating fast okay fine all right um so let's get your ear checked out i think that would be the most sensible thing to do and then after that we could we'll be a step closer to figuring out which way we're going to go it might be that there's a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear but we just need to exclude whether there's a physical blockage first and try and deal with that if that the case okay um is that the sort of thing that can cause this ringing I got in my ear The ringing that you got you got something called tinnitus And tinnitus is something actually that medicine doctors we don really understand it fully We haven't, you know, people can't give you a specific cause for why some patients get tinnitus and some patients don't. It can be triggered by a wide range of different things. And in fact, I'm glad that you've mentioned that. what I might do in the time between now and when you come for the appointment, I'm going to paste the link for a leaflet about tinnitus in the notes for this appointment. I'd really appreciate it if you could start reading about it. And often that awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are, there are limited options, that helps us in terms of conversation about what we do next if your ear is clear. So I'm going to paste a link to that and you can read about that and what we'll do is we'll see you in about four or five days time it won't be with me it'll be another GP but they'll have my notes and they'll know exactly what what my question is which is just to check your ears is that okay yes that's great all right great so um bear with me five minutes and then you come in the support team i'll leave the number in the notes for this appointment ring them and then they'll slot you in okay okay brilliant all right if any if there's any problem any issues between now and when the clinic appointment is just book another appointment you can speak to one or so in video okay all right then take care nice to see you this morning
