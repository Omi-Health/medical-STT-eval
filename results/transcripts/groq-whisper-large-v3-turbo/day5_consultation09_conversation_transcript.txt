Your address. It's 1 Babylon Avenue. And are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today. What can I do for you? I don't really know what's been going on but it's just aching all over for definitely the last six weeks it might have been slightly longer than that but it's just sort of that feeling really tired run down. Okay so when do you think you were last well? Where are we now? We just started April. Definitely Christmas, New Year. I felt relatively well, I think. So since then. Actually, yeah, I was on holiday in the States and yeah, it probably coincided with sometime around then end of January, start of February. So do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back? Probably a couple of weeks after I got back. Were you well when you were on holiday? Yeah, I had a great time, very active. Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhea, vomiting, anything like that? No not that I recall. Yeah, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards. Okay, so just tell me what symptoms you've been having. terms of just your general health any persistent cold symptoms or ear aches sore throat chest cough shortness of breath phlegm anything like that no any change in your weight at all I don't think so I'm probably less hungry but no no weight change just a bit are you eating different amounts yeah probably slightly smaller portions or more of an effort to actually eat everything that in front of me Any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat or abdominal pain No. Any change in your bowel habit, diarrhea, vomiting or blood in the stool? No. Any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine? No, that's all fine. Okay and any other general symptoms like rashes? I don't have any rashes now, in fact I've got a photo on my phone if that's helpful. I'll try and show you, hang on. Yeah this was weird, this sort of came up and then disappeared after a couple of weeks. Where's the light? I don't know, that. Okay, whereabouts was it? I think sort of calf, back of my calf because I didn't notice it my wife noticed it actually. When did you first notice it? Probably around the end of February, the middle to end of Feb and then it like it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time and I it faded over a couple of weeks I guess. Did you have any fevers at that time? To be honest that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat I had, so possibly a little bit feverish but I sort of put it down to that. Do you know where you got that when it started? Did you be walking? Did you get any bites that you noticed? I do quite a lot of walking and we did quite a lot while we were out on holiday as well. but definitely, yeah, I mean, I don't recall anybody, I don't remember seeing anything fitting, but you often like, yeah, as you're walking through, I was in shorts and boots, but I feel the other bit. Whereabouts were you in the States? Just sort of near Yosemite. Okay. And any headaches, blood, vision, tingling, numbness? No. The headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy Oh that better And have you been able to go to work as usual I been going to work I don't know how effective it's been but yeah. What's your job? I work for a health technology company actually. Okay and has your concentration been affected or your time levels in the daytime at work? Yeah definitely sort of tired and yeah less energy probably engaged than I would normally be. Have you been able to exercise okay? Not as much, I don't know if it's I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it. I'm I'm not exercising as much as I would normally. Okay. And how's your mental health, your stress levels? I look pretty good at the moment, actually. Like previously that has been an issue, but other than sort of physically feeling a bit crappy, I'm, yeah, in a pretty good place. Okay. Apart from that rash, any other rashes on your skin or swelling of your joints or pain in your joints? Yeah, sort of aching shoulders, back, the hips, knees, but sort of, yeah, not anything. Swelling that you've noticed? No. What happens, wrists, ankles, toes? No. Okay. And any other significant medical problems in the past? I mean, 80% of the most counts. Pardon? Asthma and hay fever if they help. Okay, any flowers you've got asthma recently? No, pretty well controlled. Do you take any regular inhalers or other medications? Yeah, I've got one of these preventers I think, yeah, that takes quite a day, but I've not used my... You haven't been used yet? I've been using them every day for the morning and night, but not the sub-usual. Okay. Do you take any other medications? I take one of the anti department members It might be Tyrosine Can I get that from you Just from the pharmacy Yeah, that's fine. And do you smoke? No. Drinking the alcohol? Uh... Nope. Sorry, occasionally, that one. Okay. And who do you live with at home? Just my wife. Sorry. So with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, it's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels. I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the normal things like liver, kidneys, blood count, etc. But also So some more specific things like a bacterial infection you can sometimes get, including one that you can get which can produce a rash like that. So that would involve blood tests. Are you happy to do that? Yeah, I'm generally happy with blood tests. What's the infection? Well you can get Yeah, you can get a bacterial infection caused, it's called Lyme disease, but you can get a rash from a tick bot. So that's something we would do a test for as well. And if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it. So it's definitely worth checking for, but we would also check just for other things which can cause reduced energy tiredness tiredness and aching but persistent over six weeks. Okay. So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line and then when you've had the test, arrange a follow-up about a week after you've had the test done. Okay, so do the test first and then, and that follow-up we can just do over the phone again? Yeah, we can do that over the phone to start with. Excellent. Okay. That's really helpful, thank you very much. Oh sorry, you broke up a bit. Any other questions? Oh no, not, no. Okay, that's great. Take care. Take care, thank you. Bye. Sorry.
