Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me okay? I can hear you but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Is that okay? Am I meant to just have a connection on the screen? It's audio. No, no, it's up to you fine. Now before I go any further can I confirm your name and your age? So my name is Dan Chowdhury I am 27. 27 okay and how can I help you this afternoon Dan? So I've just been having some troubles basically in I guess it's been a little while now and I've just been feeling not so great and it's all come from like it's like basically I think is diarrhea and it's like just coming out like loads of it like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and yeah it doesn't feel very solid it's so just it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's yeah it's just not not being very pleasant and like I just it just kind of hasn't doesn't feel like it's getting better so wow no sorry to hear I think that there's a lot going on there well when did it all start your symptoms um so I think it was a few when I think about it so Monday Tuesday I saw I think it was about three it's been about three days now okay and is it mainly diarrhea so you mentioned watery stools um how many times are you going a day would you say um so I feel like it's like almost every hour when i'm awake um all right okay so you're losing a lot of fluid there yeah so i mean i'm i'm trying to drink a lot of water but um yeah it's just quite a lot and uh it's yeah i think i i feel like it's just just fluids coming out okay have you got any blood in your stools? No I don't remember anything like no I think it's just nothing like that there's nothing. And any tummy pain any pain in your tummy? Yeah I mean I feel a cramp and then I know it's time to go right so around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go so yeah I I mean that's the kind of first sign. Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? It's kind of, if I think about it, it's like at the bottom. I don't know if that makes sense. Why don't we start with, is it in the middle or is it to one particular side? I think it feels pretty like in the middle to me, not on any side left or right. And does this pain come and go or is it there constantly? It comes and goes. Okay. And if I was to ask in a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever had, how bad is this pain? Okay, so like, so what do you mean by uh pain so i i think it maybe is it is this pain that making you double over is 10 is it 10 out of 10 the worst pain you've ever had or is it more of a kind of a mild pain like a 3 out of 10 i i guess so i'm when i think about it like when i get it i can pretend that i don't feel it so i can still sit down and i can still like cover it up and people don't really notice so i i don't know what that means but maybe is that like a six or a seven okay all right good um apart from the pain and diarrhea any other symptoms like nausea vomiting um yeah i definitely i definitely feel kind of nauseous um like i and like i've have vomited and when i like i think it's maybe something to do with like whenever i have like milk or something like that i just feel like i want to vomit and actually like yeah one time i just like had some milk and i just completely vomited it okay i've been trying to avoid it but um yeah the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea is that right um sorry could you repeat that the vomiting is not as uh prominent as the diarrhea is that right no no it's not okay okay all right Any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? So yeah I think I am pretty I feel kind of really hot all the time and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that but it's yeah I'm not a normal temperature. Okay so you're feeling hot okay and in terms of your waterworks are you passing urine okay? um yeah but i guess less frequently maybe um but yeah it seems to be okay okay all right um fine and you said mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off are you aware of any triggers i mean have you for example gone out had some takeaway food have you been around anyone else and with diarrhea for example um so i know so my um my brother has had actually had something like this for um he has it as well for five days as well um and i i i'm not yeah i can't think of what what the trigger is for me i mean my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me but yeah that's why is your brother now better um he so he's been like this for five days i think he's getting better but i'm not i'm not really sure he said he said he had he's had something for a little while as well okay all right are you having anything to eat a drink if you're i can see you're drinking your coffee but are you keeping it down are you keeping your fluids down um so it just feels like um the fluids do go down but it just feels like it's going straight through just feels like it's going straight through okay all right fine when was was a lot of me anything solid to eat which you kept in? So I had some lunch today but again it just came out pretty loose Alright and Dan moving forward are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical history So I think otherwise I'm fitting well, I mean I'm an okay weight and I can't think of any related medical history. history I mean like my yeah I know I don't think so I'll take you don't take any regular medications and so I um no I mean I've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately but I haven't been I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that okay and do you have any allergies any medications? So I don't have any allergies that I know of. Okay what about any family history do you have any family history of bowel problems? Would bowel like does is the colon like something? Yeah so what I mean by bowel is the whole gut so yeah my dad actually has colon cancer at the moment. Oh dear I'm very sorry to hear that how is he? so um from what i heard he's kind of so i don't i don't speak to him that often so i don't i don't know the exact details and i i don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing but um he's sort of in his third stage i'm not sure what that means exactly um yeah okay yeah so yeah it's it's um he's yeah you can i can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting him a lot and um that's it's quite i i guess he's um had it for a little while now well i'm really sorry i'll make a note of that because uh it's important to know these kind of details um and socially tell me more about your home situation who's at home with you dan um so uh not my brother he doesn't live with me i'm i live with my um sister and my mum okay and uh how are things at home um what sense do you mean that in general day-to-day life are you managing okay any particular i mean uh i think uh yeah it's been it's been tricky um going to work with all of this um i I dislike taking time off work. I feel like I just want to go when I can. So I try and go. I think at home, yeah, I just haven't really, I don't normally actually eat with my family. I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing. So I don't think it's affected them. And I haven't really been, I haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mom about it. yeah I'd just rather deal with these things. You mentioned work what is it you do for work So I work at an office in central London so I work in government Government, okay. Just a couple of last final questions. Smoking and alcohol do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? so i i smoke um i smoke uh uh for like socially but not like regularly um so normally if it's a friday or something like that i might i might have a cigarette or something like that but um sorry and alcohol so alcohol um you know i might have a beer during the weekdays maybe not that many maybe um on fridays i have more um alcohol um but yeah i buy a lot more units um on it i suppose um not every week but maybe uh once or twice a month but yeah i'll go out with my friends and drink a lot so that that's um yeah well thank you for sharing with me that's very helpful to know so um dan just as a uh conclusion um just to wrap it all up i think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis okay a bit of a basically infection of your tummy okay there's nothing to worry about i'm i suspect this will just settle down in the next few days just like i did for your brother make sure you drink plenty of fluids okay um you can should i just drink like normal water i just feel like every time i drink it's just coming out um probably but i am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins um so you can get things like diarolite which is a fluid replacement we can get from the pharmacy it's probably worth recommending that do i need like a prescription for that no you can just get over the counter okay um you can try just you know regular paracetamol if you are being feverish But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so 48 hours, I want you to give me a call back because, you know, if you are getting dehydrated, then we need to do further investigations, okay? But I think let's see how you are in the next one to two days. Okay. And we'll catch up soon, okay? Okay, so you're saying that I should – I'll try and buy this diarolite. What should I do in terms of food and that kind of thing? Should I just focus on fluids? Food dissolving, yeah, absolutely. so clear fluids you can use soft diet things like soup mash and then gradually build up um as much as your body can tolerate um but really let's try and keep yourself well hydrated first okay okay is it okay for me to carry on having like um paracetamol and things like that absolutely if you are having if you've got a bit of tummy pain if you're feeling feverish then i think paracetamol is very sensible okay okay try and avoid alcohol if you can uh okay i'll try yeah okay all right then okay thank you for your help all right thank you very much thanks thanks for helping me out
