Hello, hi I'm Dr Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hi. Hi. So just before we start is it alright if you could confirm your name for me please? Yeah, John Doe. Okay and your date of birth? I am 2112 and 1986. And your address for me please. Is number one London Street, NW36PQ. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. We are, yes. Okay. So I understand you're having a headache, is that correct? uh yeah i've had a um a sort of a fairly sort of bad severe headache for the past four days um and um i've been sort of feeling a bit hot as well um i've got a bit of a temperature i think i haven't measured it but um i think i yeah i think i've got fever okay right and um so what started first was it the headache or the fever? So headache started first and then sort of yeah fever sort of came along a bit afterwards. Okay afterwards right and what have you taken so far for your headache? So I've had some paracetamol and some ibuprofen but it's not really helping at the moment. Okay so just a few more questions with regards to your headache so do you find it difficult to look at the light? No, it's fine, light doesn't seem to bother me too much. Okay and is it any pain when you try to move your neck from side to side up and down is there any pain I got sort of general aching muscles not necessary sort of in my neck it kind of a bit all over really. Okay all over right and have you been sick with this headache? No I haven't been sick. Okay and do you have a cough? No no cough. Okay so there's no cough or cold yeah? No. And your ears are okay? There's no ear aches? No, it seems to be okay. That's fine. Okay. All right. And with this headache, have you experienced any pins and needles in your face, arms and legs? No. No pins and needles. Any muscle weaknesses at all? Just, I suppose, general aching, body aching. Not any weakness where you couldn't hold a cup or anything like that, that's what I mean. No, I'm sort of, yeah, I'm fine with that sort of stuff, but yeah. Okay, and just a few more questions to you, because I don't have any of your background history. Do you suffer from any medical conditions? No, general medical history is fine. Fine and no surgical history, no medical or surgical complaints, yeah? No, I suppose I have been away to Thailand a week or so ago. I've had some like usual mosquito bites from sort of traveling around. A friend of mine has also been a bit unwell, but yeah, that's the only sort of like history per se. Right and do you have any kind of shivering at all Do you shivering with the fever I do feel cold quite a lot You know, no sort of shivering, but definitely like a bit cold. Hot and cold, yeah? Yeah. Okay, right. And are you using, you mentioned about the paracetamol ibuprofen now, but are you on any regular, any medication, anything that you're using at all? No. Okay. Any allergies at all? No. All right. Okay. And okay. So I believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you. Yeah. It's not possible for us to do that online. I think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination. and I think you would need one quite urgently. Okay, so the thing that's running in the back of my mind are kind of viral illnesses that one can get with sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel, like malaria. The other common thing around Thailand, it will be like some Dengu, but that would have, like you would have some blood spots or bleeding or something, which you don't have at the moment do you? No, I mean I've got a bit of a rash but nothing like no bleeding. Okay, so where's the rash? It's, rash is kind of all over my body. How would you describe the rash? sort of red and itchy Red and itchy Okay so if you want to put a glass on top of the rash does that rash go away Yes It goes away okay Okay so what we need to do is to urgently examine you and that's sometime today okay and after our examination there is a high possibility that that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital but I'm not sure as yet so I'd like you to be seen one of our hubs as soon as possible okay I'll write night notes in and recommend that you would need to be urgency seen by the doctor preferably in the next few hours time okay and in any case if that's not available I'd like you to take yourself to A&E. Okay. Alright, any questions at all? No, sound serious. It's, you know, obviously when I've spoken to you, you didn't tick the box for many theories but you're in the middle somewhere, let's put it that way. Okay. If you know things like we have to rule out is meningitis and all but then you just have a general muscle ache, you didn't say that you had things like you had problems looking at light or something so those are things when we think of meningitis but and then it's the uh in meningitis you get a non-blanching rash while in any kind of virus you know the rash usually goes away saying that we don't know whether these are the beginning stages so that's why i'd rather but i would rather you see a gp as soon as possible if uh we've got a slot available but if not i think you need to be seen and maybe have some blood tests and examinations okay okay cool thank you very much all right you take care then bye now cheers bye
