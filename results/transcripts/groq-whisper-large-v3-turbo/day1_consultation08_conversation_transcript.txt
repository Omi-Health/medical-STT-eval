Okay. Oh, I can't. Hello. Hello. Hello. Just before we go any further, can I confirm your name and age, please? My name's Faisa and I'm 26. Okay, and how can I help you this afternoon? So basically, I've been really stressed at work for the past few days, and I've realised that I've got really dry, itchy skin. Okay, sorry to hear work's been very stressful. Tell me more about your skin firstly. You mentioned it's been dry and itchy. Whereabouts in your skin? All over my arms and my hands mainly. Okay, and is this something you've had before? No, never had before. Did it come about quite suddenly or was it more kind of a gradual thing? I think it started a few days ago. Okay and has this spread anywhere else? Has this spread to your chest, your legs, your face? No. Okay so apart from being dry and itchy, any other symptoms? Has it been sore? Have you noticed any cracked skin? So my skin's quite red and I'm using coconut butter for the past few days. Okay. I don't have any spots. No fevers. I'm not sweating either. Thank you for mentioning all those. Okay so the coconut butter hasn't helped with the itch? No. Okay and you mentioned work's been quite stressful. What do you do for work I work as a teacher Okay and in what way has work been stressful I think the kids have been really annoying these days Okay well Well I'm sorry to hear that and I hope it gets better. Going back to your skin, is there anything you've done perhaps which may have triggered your symptoms? Anything you've touched? for example shower gel, soaps, fabric cleaners? I went swimming a few days ago. Okay, is that the first time in your life or have you been before? No, I've been before. Okay and did your symptoms start after you went swimming? Yes. Okay, all right. You mentioned you've had no other fevers, is that right? no fevers no vomiting no no how's your health otherwise it's pretty good yeah I'm not on any medication we'll get to medication in just a second and do you feel genuinely run down do you feel tired yeah I think I have been quite tired okay are you eating and drinking okay yeah I've been drinking and eating as Your appetite is fine, is it? Okay. And your bowels, are your bowels working okay? Yeah. No problems with vomiting or loose stools? No. Okay. And your waterworks are all okay? Your past urine okay? Yep. Okay, all right. So just moving on, in terms of your other medical history, is there anything else I should be aware of? I'm currently taking microchip. Micogynon? Yeah. Okay, do you know what that is? No. Okay, it's a contraceptive pill. Does that make sense Does that ring a bell now Oh yeah Okay Is it any other medications that you take Oh no No So in terms of your medical history there no problems of skin problems in the past things like eczema or dermatitis? No, I think it might just be the weather. Sorry, what was that? You think it's... I think it might just be the weather. the weather? Yeah. Oh you think the weather? Okay, you think the weather? Okay. That's okay, no problems. Do you suffer from allergies? Are you someone who suffers from allergies? Allergies, medication allergies? I think I'm lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerant, okay that could be helpful to know. In terms of family history, is there anything in the family that you're aware of? Yeah, so my dad has asthma and my mum has hay fever. Hay fever? Yep. Okay. Fine. But again, any skin problems that you're aware of? No. No. Okay. Alright. Socially, who do you live with at home? Just me. Do you live alone? Do you live alone? Yep. And do you smoke at all? Can I ask, do you smoke? Are you a smoker? No, I don't smoke. Have you drink much anywhere of alcohol? No. Recreational drugs? No. And you said you work as a primary school teacher? Yes, that's right. The reason I ask is sometimes stress can be a contributing factor. You felt, you noticed yourself, your life has been more stressful recently. Do you think that might have any correlation to your symptoms? I don think so Okay alright Fine Okay well normally at this stage I like to proceed examination but based on your story it's difficult. I think, you know, essentially the story is you've got dry, itchy rash on your, mainly your hands you mentioned and your arms which started perhaps after swimming a few days ago but no other symptoms you're feeling otherwise well no fevers no bleeding or discharge from skin I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis have you heard of that condition before I have yeah okay great well I can give you a patient information about that which gives me more information about the disease but it's something that we can readily treat it with a couple of options you have steroid creams I can give you which will help with inflammation and something called emollients which can help with the dry dry skin and that's something you just need to kind of paste on onto your skin throughout the day for next few days and hopefully that helps your symptoms Okay, cool, thank you very much. You can also try antihistamines so you can get things over the counter, pyrotin, loratadine, that can help with the itchiness. Yeah that sounds good. Okay and that's probably what I recommend. Paracetamol on this occasion wouldn't be helpful, painkillers wouldn't be helpful on this occasion. But let's see how the next few days go and if it's still not getting better come back and see me next week and we can have another look again at your symptoms. Okay perfect thank you very much. Do you have any questions for me? No. Okay well I wish you all the best have a good day. Well thank you very much bye.
