Hi there, it's Dr Smith from Babylon. Can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address please? It's very same. I can't hear you at the moment actually, could you turn the volume up? Can you give me a turn up? Yeah, that's better. Thank you. Okay, sorry about that. Are you in a private place so you can have a consultation? Yes. What can I do for you today? I've been having this blinding headache for a few days, and it's really bothering me. I find it very hard to focus, or I can't even go to work. Okay, and any headaches in the past before this? Not really, just the on and off. I recently had one for like two days but it just went away with ibuprofen so nothing like for longer than two days before. So how did this start? It just started all of a sudden I woke up one morning with a headache and that was three days ago and I just keep having it. It doesn't really go away with ibuprofen either. I try that but it just it gets a little bit better but like doesn't go away. Okay and whereabouts in your head is the pain? um it's kind of all over but i feel like over my right eye is a bit stronger okay any problems with your vision or any problems tolerating the light um lights definitely make me more sensitive like um i don't really like strong lights um and um yeah vision i think i get is shooting lights sometimes I'm not sure how to explain it just a bit of a weird kind of vision. Okay and any nausea or vomiting? No feeling a bit sick but not vomiting. Any tingling or numbness or weakness anywhere? No. Any change in your smell or taste? No no at all And in the past when you had headaches what have they been like I would say quite normal headaches just a bit of a pressure in between my eyes but nothing major Okay, and with this, has it been there all the time or is it coming and going? kind of all the time and so when I take up drop in it gets a bit better so it's a bit like less it bothers me less but then I still have it it's still there and what would you say the severity is if 10 is the worst pain you've ever had in zeros nothing what would you say the pain is like I guess it's mostly eight and then it kind of comes down to maybe a five okay and what about at night time you able to fall asleep? Yeah I'm sleeping well. Is it waking you up in the night time? No no no, but I can wake up with it in the morning. Okay any worse when you change position or bend over or cough or anything like that? Sometimes when I stand up quickly I get a bit of a stabbing pain or if I tear in my head like I kind of feel like something is moving inside. Okay and have you had any eye checks recently? Yeah I actually had one recently and nothing changed my vision. Okay and have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears or pain over the sinuses? No. Or phlegm? No. Any nosebleeds or coughing up any blood or anything? No. And just recently have you been well or have you had any general problems? Any change in your weight or tiredness, lack of energy, anything like that? No change of weight, maybe a lack of energy but it might be because I'm just having this headache so I find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities but you know when you have this constant headache. Have you been at work recently? I work from home but couldn't really manage to do it all the time so sometimes I just do the day off. So you've had a headache over three days, how many days have you missed off work? So I work from home all these three days. First day I work from home and then the second day I just took the whole day off and today I just tried to work on the first half of the day but I just stopped in the morning because I couldn focus Okay, and any other medical problems in the past? I think I only had a problem with pain when I was younger but no cause was found and that went away but that's the only thing I know of. Okay, have you been abroad recently at all? No. Do you take any medications? Just the pill. Which one? Marcellaone. And when did you start that? About a year ago. Any side effects with that? No, I don't think so. Have you noticed any increased frequency of headaches since you started that? No, because this headache is just very recent, nothing really changes. Okay, and when you described your headaches in the past, you said they were just general, did you have any visual symptoms, flat lights? No. No. Was there nausea, vomiting with them? No, nothing. And how did your blood pressure check with your pill? Yeah, I had a choice in the pharmacy when I got the pill and they said it was normal. And when was that? A year ago. Okay. And any allergies to anything? No. And who do you live with at home? Sorry? Who do you live with at home? Just by myself. Okay. And do you smoke? No. Do you drink any alcohol regularly? Yeah. How much in a normal week do you think? Probably like three beers once a week. Okay and do you take any other drugs at all? No, apart from the apropos and I take sometimes and the headache gets really bad. So I mean it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache and you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well? Yeah. But you haven't had a high temperature, have you checked your temperature? No I didn but I don really feel nervous or anything Okay I mean it could possibly be a migraine type headache but it still ongoing for three days We probably should look you into an appointment to get an examination and obviously if it settles in the meantime then we can cancel that but we should do a neurological examination, look at the back of your eyes as well. Okay. In terms of medication I can prescribe you something similar to ibuprofen but a bit stronger which you can take instead of ibuprofen and you can take paracetamol at the same time. Okay. So if you're happy to book an appointment with the support line for us to do a full examination and start the medication which I prescribed to you, take it with food. You said that when you go to bed your headache's okay and not waking you up in the night time? Yeah it's not but you mentioned migraine and that reminded me that my mum suffers from like she has migraines. Okay any other family history of medical problems? No I didn't answer it but I know that my mum like she has quite bad migraine she's like has the vomiting and everything. Okay that's fine. I mean if in the meantime before your appointment your headache is getting unbearable or getting worse or changing then if it's that bad then you should go to A&E and have an examination and you can call us for further advice on that. When you have an examination with us we'll check your blood pressure as well just to make sure your pill is still appropriate for you because if we do think it's a migraine then you would have to change your pill if you've had these flashing lights and things like that. Is there anything in the pill that can cause it or is it? Well it's something so that pill if you were having my regular migraines with the flashing lights or other symptoms it wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill particularly. We'd have to change it something else. All right. But you can carry on with that for the moment. Okay. Have you got any other questions? So would you like send me a referral to a specialist or to book an appointment with the support team then we can do a full examination then. Okay, perfect. All right then, take care. Thank you very much. Bye.
