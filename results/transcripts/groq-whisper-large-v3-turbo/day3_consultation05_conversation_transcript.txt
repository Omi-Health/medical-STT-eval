So you've mentioned that you're feeling dizzy, is it? Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I'm feeling, yeah, just feeling very sick it's probably because i'm feeling dizzy um my room is sort of spinning um and i i can't i can't walk properly well i can walk properly but not straight um and my ears are buzzing a bit i'm just feeling a bit off okay he is buzzing so when did it all start started probably about two hours ago maybe but I had it a similar sort of thing about a month ago but I didn't really think anything of it because it settled quite quickly and this has been going for a bit more now. Okay so you said you mentioned it started a few hours ago so when did it start were you doing um i was actually making my husband some breakfast um and i yeah i just suddenly felt very fuzzy and dizzy um and a bit shaky okay so like the room spinning around yeah okay and is how long does it last for or is it there now continuously now yeah so it's there now for the past two hours you'd say yeah yeah okay did you have any kind of viral illness in the recent past past couple of weeks no no cold cough nothing no i've been pretty healthy i think um yeah yeah okay um you mentioned that you have some year buzzing kind of thing any kind of ear pain or ear discharge anything like that no nothing okay do you have a temperature at all i don't think so okay right you also mentioned that you can walk but you're not walking straight why is that is it because i think just because the room feels like it's moving a bit um it feels like that's why you feel like you're a bit unsteady yeah my my legs and arms and everything are working fine I just I don't feel like I'm stable my the room is spinning so there's no weakness of your arms and legs okay no okay right um so you mentioned you had something like this a month ago so how how how long did that episode last for probably only about five ten minutes Okay right and do you have any problems hearing at the moment Like is it muffled or something It just a bit of a buzzy noise in my ears but otherwise I can hear everything. Okay, rightio. Okay, so have you been physically sick? No, but I am feeling very sick. Nausea, okay. Right here.

I've had premature ovarian failure and I've taken HRT. Okay, HRT and premature ovarian failure. Okay, and any other medications at all? No. Do you have any allergies at all? No. Talking to you today, the most common diagnosis we would say we are suffering from at the moment is something called labyrinthitis. Yeah, okay, that's when your middle ear, there is some inflammation going on there and there is some imbalances in the crystals there in your middle ear. Okay, so what the most important treatment is actually giving you some kind of middle ear sedative so that you won't feel as if for going around in a boat kind of feeling Okay so that what we need to start because to actually make you able to function a bit more we start doing certain medications I would still like you to be seen by one of our doctors to take a look inside your ears to just make sure so this is like just symptomatic relief like you have a fever we just give paracetamol so just to you know make you able to come and see one of the doctors and things like that when while you're with the doctors we'd like to do your blood pressure just examine your you know you know how you're walking and everything is okay while we're waiting while you're waiting on seeing the doctor if you develop any weakness of your legs or arms or or you know a sudden headache any of those symptoms or you start being violently sick with it then you know you would need to take your work to amy okay but if not wait for the appointment for the doctor to examine you and we'll take it from there so i'll i'll send the prescription across to your pharmacy it looks like it's the Lloyd pharmacy on our system is that correct yeah yeah so we'll send you across that prescription it's called Cematol yeah it's one tablet three times a day so I'll give about ten days but in the interim obviously in the next few days you'll get to see one of my doctors and we'll have to just take it from there okay thank you so much any questions at all can you take do you need to take those tablets with food or can you just take them anytime it doesn't really matter you can take it because sometimes you know you get the symptoms as soon as you wake up so probably you'll feel a bit sick to eat and i think so might as well just take the tablets okay that's great thank you so much that's so helpful just make sure you call support to book that appointment okay i will thank you
