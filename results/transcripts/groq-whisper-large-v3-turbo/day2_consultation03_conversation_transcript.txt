Hello. Hi there, good morning. Hi. I'm Dr. Dean Muggett in Group Yearhand. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Hello. Hi. So before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth if that's okay? Yes, Mary Richards. I'm 40 years old. Okay fine, so you're 40 years old you said yeah? Perfect, okay. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yep. Okay great. So how can I help you today? So I've just been having some problems with my hearing, I can't really hear very well and I notice that my face has been feeling a bit numb recently. Right, okay. Okay and how long has this been going on for? It's been a few weeks now, about three weeks or something. Right, okay. And is this just on one side or both sides? Just one side, just on my left side. I've noticed that the hearing has kind of gone down a bit. Right, okay. And your face is feeling numb. Where exactly is that? Which part of your face? Can you show me with your finger? Yeah, so again, it's the left side. It's kind of like around my left ear and kind of along here, so like my jawline's just all feeling a bit numb around here. Right, okay. Has anything else happened in this time? Any other symptoms you've had at all? Not that I've noticed. I think occasionally notice that there's ringing in my ear. Some ringing in your ear, okay. Yeah, part of it. Sure okay And have you had any weakness or numbness in the rest of the body at all No no no nothing like that Okay Have you had any difficulties swallowing No And have you had any difficulties speaking No, no. Have you noticed any problems with your vision at all? No, that's all good. Okay. And do you have the numbness present right now? Yeah, it's kind of there quite often, like all the time. So, yeah, right now it feels very, it doesn't feel like when I touch the inside of my face, Sure, sure, okay. All right. Just going back to the kind of muffled hearing feeling in the ear, do you have any discharge coming from that ear at all? No, nothing. Nothing coming out. Any pain in the ear or from the ear? No. Right, okay. And have you had any fever at all? No, nothing like that. And do you have any itchiness in the ear? No. Do you use cottonwood buds to clean your ears out? I don't, oh no no no, don't use cottonwood buds. Alright, I need to ask a few other general questions. Do you have any other illnesses at all? I've kind of been told I had polyps in my nose in the past and occasionally get some kind of half-urny feeling. that's all fine and you know I take a Rennie's if I need to and if my no polyps are playing up I've got a spray other than that I think they said ages ago I had something called labyrinthitis something like that but again nothing nothing on there. So are you on any regular medication you mentioned the spray for your nose? Yes I know I only take the spray for my nose when I need it for and sometimes like Rennie but I just get that from the chemist Sure And the spray for your nose where do you get that from Is that from a doctor Yeah they gave me a prescription ages ago Yeah do you remember the name of the spray at all Unfortunately I don sorry That all right and you not on any other medication at all No. Okay do you have any allergies to any medication? No just latex. Latex okay all right that's good to know. And in terms of your family are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all my brother had neurofibromatosis i think it is right other than that everyone else is okay okay good um and in terms of your own kind of background now are you are you working at the moment yeah so i'm a i'm a jockey um but because of all the kind of symptoms i've been getting especially sometimes when i get a ringing i feel a bit busy um i've just had to do far less training So kind of beginning to, yeah, impacting work a little bit now. Okay. So you have to excuse my ignorance. You mean, jockey like with horses? Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. All right. Okay. Fine. Great. And do you live alone? I live with my partner. Okay. Right. Do you have any pets at all at home? No. No pets. Okay. Fine. Fantastic. All right. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about? what's been going on recently uh no just like like i said like the ringing um occasionally and when i get back and sometimes feel a bit dizzy but the main thing is really this lack of hearing and the numbness that's got me like just yeah no idea what's going on there okay fine all right um so what i think go on it was just like there was one thing i think because i can panic and you can look online a bit frantic I guess what I trying to think is you know is there something particularly serious you know will need to be sorted and obviously reading anything can make you really frantic is it hopefully nothing so serious I would die from it I don't know I just I think obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via video portal but from what you've told me this doesn't seem to be anything that you're going to die from. However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today. Okay, I would like you to come into one of my clinics. I'd like a GP to assess you. What you're describing might be something called Bell's Palsy. We can go into that, explaining what that is, if that's confirmed on physical examination. That's not usually a life-threatening problem but part of the reason why I'd like you to come in is just that we can do what we call a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on and confirm that might be the diagnosis. Have a look inside the ear, see if there's anything to see within the ear. So in answer to your question, no I don't think that you need to worry about that. I think you know preliminarily I can reassure you, however, in order to definitively reassure you I think you need a physical examination today okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to send a message to our admin team I'll ask them to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics within central London okay and then you can ring the support team number I'll leave that number in your notes you can ring them after five minutes and then they'll slot you into a place that's convenient for you okay that's fine all right so someone will see you and hopefully we'll be able to reassure you further but please make sure the appointment gets done today okay yep that's fine thank you very much all right then okay nice to see you take care bye
