Yeah around five to six times a day. Okay and can you tell me, I know it's not nice to talk about, but is it quite watery your stools? Yes it's definitely watery loose stools. Any blood in your stools? No, not that I could see. Okay and with the diarrhea have you noticed any other symptoms like tummy pain? Not really no but I feel like I can't really drink too much so I feel very dehydrated Okay when you say you can drink too much why is that Yeah because really I like I feel like I don drink enough like I drinking I trying to drink but then I just go to the loo and I poo everything and I feel dehydrated again. Okay, alright. Have you managed to eat anything, solids? Not much, not much, so just a little bit. I don't feel, I don't really feel like I have appetite. Okay, your appetite has reduced, okay. With your, the vomiting has now stopped, is that right? Yes. Okay, alright. Have you any other symptoms like fever or temperature? so not really I feel a little bit warm probably at the beginning I was feeling I had a bit of temperature but now I feel I feel kind of fine okay I feel very weak though okay all right any headaches or muscle pains not really okay all right and you mentioned three days ago what were you doing when the symptoms started are you aware of any triggers not that I remember what was I doing I I was at home I was working on my computer and yeah I just felt like some nausea and I had to to vomit and then I had some diarrhea straight after that yeah did you have any takeaway food or any dodgy restaurant food? Not that I remember. Have you been around anyone unwell with diarrhea recently last week or so Not that I know Okay right so moving on are you otherwise pretty well yeah yeah okay and do you take any regular medications so I I do suffer of asthma so I do have my nailers that are you know I I use infrequently let's say only when I have is that a blue inhaler is that the blue inhaler yes it is yeah okay all right any other medications that you take no nothing okay do you have any allergies to any medications not that I know okay and any family history of any medical problems so my father has high what used to have high blood pressure he actually so he actually died of bowel cancer like ten years ago okay sorry to hear this okay and what about your mother oh yes So probably it's worth mentioning she has diabetes. Diabetes. Do we know if that's type 1 or type 2? It's type 2. Okay, all right. Fine. And just a little bit more about your life in general, sir. Who lives at home with you? Sorry? Who lives at home with you, sir? Oh, I live alone. You live alone, okay. Are you currently working at the moment? Well, I haven't been able to work in the past few days, but yes, like in my... What's your employment? What do you do for work? I'm a software engineer. Software engineer, okay, all right. Have you taken time off work recently? Yes yes I have These last three days I been feeling really unwell so I couldn work Okay all right And just last couple of questions regarding your smoking and alcohol Do you do either of those Not really. I drink infrequently, like socially let's say, and I don't smoke. Okay. All right. Fine. So, Robert, having listened to your story, I think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis. Okay. Which essentially is just a tummy bug. It's an infection of your tummy. And normally lasts for about three to five days and gets better. All right. The things you can do to really help yourself get better soon are you can drink plenty of fluids, really try and flush the toxins out of your body. Okay. You can get things from the pharmacy, which are called Dirolyte, which can help replenish any minerals and vitamins you may have lost. I'm sorry, what's the name of that? It's called Dirolyte. It's a type of fluid replacement drink. you can take some paracetamol if you're feeling feverish and weak I would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for the next day or two until you get better normally you have to be diarrhea free for about 24 to 48 hours before you return back to work let's see how the next few days go and if you're still not better next week I want you to come back and see me and we can have another look at your symptoms that sounds good thanks so much Do you have any questions for me? No, I think that's fine. Yeah, I'll try to write and drink plenty of fluid, and I hope it goes away. If it doesn't, I'll call back. Is that okay? I really hope you get better soon. Thanks a lot. Thanks so much for your time. Bye-bye. Okay, bye.
