Hello. Hello. Hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please? Michael John. And your date of birth? 092983. Okay. And your address for me, please. 231 Leonard London Street sorry London okay and that's correct and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation yes okay you've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea I'm sorry to hear about it so if you tell me a bit more about it please it's been happening for about three days now okay Yeah, it started off, I don't know, it's just something that I thought would go away pretty quickly. I've had that from time to time after eating certain types of food or going on certain travels, but nothing funky in my diet or no travels recently. And it just kind of kept up. I'm a bit confused as to what to do. So you haven't had anything from outside, nothing dodgy, anything but? No. No, no, no, no. Just a little bit. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's pretty standard diarrhea where there's like a little bit of abdominal pain. I threw up once. I don't know if that was a little worrying. Repeat that piece. That wasn't clear. What did you say? I threw up once. Once? After that, we said something. Nothing else was worrying. Okay. Right. With the diarrhea, how many times a day are you going to the toilet? Four to five. Four to five times, yeah. And is there any, and it's like water? Is it like water or is it just loose? What do you mean? Are you going like water or is it just you know a bit of solid stools a bit loose kind of thing It probably depends on the time of day to be honest A bit of both A bit of both And is there any blood or mucus? No blood. What do you mean mucus? It's like the snotty stuff. In the stool? Yeah. It looks like snot. Do you? No. No. So no mucus. Okay. Any fever at all? Maybe a little bit, but it hasn't been, that in particular hasn't been too worrying. Are you still able to eat and drink? A little bit of appetite loss, I guess, versus the normal. Okay. But also not something I've, like, if that was alone, I wouldn't have reached out. so but you're you're still able to drink quite a bit yeah you're drinking plenty yeah yeah okay mostly to try and rid okay and um what have you take have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea nothing yet nothing yet okay anything for the abdominal pain uh nothing yet okay right and any unfortunately we don't have any of your past medical history is that anything you'd like to say uh i probably i had asthma um or or i don't know i guess i still have it okay and are you any anything else other than asthma uh my dad had hypertension okay Okay. Has hypertension. Yeah. Has hypertension. Yeah, he died of bowel cancer 10 years ago. Oh, yeah. Okay, bowel cancer, 10 years ago. And how old was he when he died? Uh, 62. Okay. And you mentioned you had asthma. Are you using any inhalers at all? Yes. Which ones? Lexapro. Sorry? Lexapro. Laxipro Yes Okay not heard of it Is it like salbutamol Is it like a blue color Yellow. Yellow, okay. I'll have to check that one. Not sure. Laxipro. Okay. That's fine. Any other medication that you're using? Over the counter, anything at all? No. late now okay right any allergies nothing yeah nothing no allergies at all right here fine so obviously you know you just have diarrhea it's about four to five times a day um you're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated which is a good sign okay um then we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day that means probably you are you know whatever you're eating is going straight through okay you still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids okay when you go to the toilet um things that one would advise is a soft diet so avoid dairy fish meat eggs while you're having the diarrhea sorry what is a soft diet what is that like outside of not those things what do you mean by soft okay so that will be like crackers toast jam those kind of things that's easily digestive like what we would give babies yeah when they start eating you give simple food for babies you don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding so that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about yeah once you are able to you know keep most of it in you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash once you're okay with that for about 48 hours then you can start having meat so just don't have meat once you feel like you're slightly better because you might go back to square one again What do you want to be okay with that diet? Like once... Well, 48 hours, you're not having any diarrhea, you're fine, then you can go and start having meat egg fish and all that So that when you If the diarrhea is getting better but isn getting or do you want it to go away completely at that point or if it like trending up no no no you preferably just don because why do we say this is because it takes much more time for me to get digested so because your gut flora you know the the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food while it doesn't take that much of an effort to you know digest mash and vegetables does that make sense yes yeah so at the same time you could have some you although you can't milk is not a good idea yogurts are a good idea because they are probiotics it helped to build up the normal gut bacteria back okay so those kind of now things to look out for if your diarrhea doesn't go away in a week's time or if you're passing blood we need a stool sample because that means you might you may have some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics okay okay if you again as I've mentioned previously if you're going about six to eight times a day that means there's a high chance that you are having the dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time if that happens you get in touch with us again all right okay any questions you look a bit confused now that's it yeah okay and also you could get something called I rely over the counter so it helps to replenish your the salts that you've been that's lost through going to the toilet okay okay if you're a bit confused you know you can actually all this is all recorded in your app so you can go back I'll put that all in detail so if you know if I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything you can go back and read the notes okay that's great all right then you take care all right
