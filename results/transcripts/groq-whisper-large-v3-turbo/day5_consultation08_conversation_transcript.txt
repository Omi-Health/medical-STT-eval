Did you have to miss school? Yeah, occasionally. Okay, and when do you think that asthma stopped? At what age did you get to a point where you weren taking medication anymore a few years ago like three or four years ago I think Yeah. And so this time, how did it start? Did you have any other symptoms, any chest pain, temperature, cold symptoms, anything like that? Yeah, so I have cough and cough a lot and I have a fever. liver. I also used to walk to work but recently I can't because I feel like very short breath and sometimes I feel like I can't even finish saying a sentence. It's quite difficult to complete the talking sometimes, occasionally. Right. Have you coughed any phlegm up or anything like that? No. Any blood in there when you cough? No, I don't think so. Okay, and any chest pain? No chest pain, no. Have you been woken up at night time at all? No, just daytime working, yeah. Have you been able to do any exercise? No, I can't. Okay, and do you have a peak flow meter at home where you measure your breathing? Sorry? Do you have what's called a peak flow meter which you breathe into to get a score on your breathing? No, no. And do you normally take any asthma inhalers over the last few years? Yes. You do? So you said you stopped them three to four years ago? Oh, when I had asthma I used to take this. Okay, how about over the last three to four years? Yeah. Have you taken any medication? I took Sopatomal, yeah. Okay so you normally take that do you or is that just recently? Normally, yeah. Okay and how often do you normally need it? Every few weeks, I'm not sure.

Okay and when at the moment are you feeling short of breath when you're sitting still or just walking and walk? Just walk or sometimes but currently I feel well. Are you able to get up and down the stairs okay? Yeah. Right okay. And did you say you were finding it hard to complete your sentences? Yeah sometimes. Okay. Yeah, it's like this. Right, okay. I mean it sounds like you've had a flare up of your asthma. It could be triggered by if there's more pollen around or there may be, you may have a viral infection causing it to get worse. Did you say you checked your temperature already? Yes, I checked. I have fever. Was it normal Yeah yeah What was your temperature Uh 37 Yeah Okay that fine Have you got an asthma inhaler at home? Yeah. Okay. So what I would suggest is you take it more regularly than you are doing at the moment. Have you got a spacer at home? do you want to show me how to do it or somehow um do you have a spacer at home no okay um what i can do is i can prescribe you a peak flow meter so we can check your breathing level and a spacer to use your inhaler a bit more efficiently which the pharmacist can show you how you use that when you pick it up yeah sure and if you increase it so you're taking it two to four puffs like every four hours initially if you get a high temperature or your wheezing is getting worse you need to call us back straight away so we can just advise you further with that okay and it would be a good idea when you're feeling better if we could arrange just a review just to see how your asthma is because we may need to start some other medication for you okay sounds good you can arrange a review in a week or so um but but before that and if you're if you're feeling worse in a week right okay okay and the other thing to do would be to take a regular antihistamine which you can get from the pharmacy i can put a question on your notes about what to take yeah that'll be helpful and then if you when you get the peak flow meter if you can take the pharmacist can show you how to use it and if you could record a value first thing when you wake up in the evening over the next week and then we can discuss that over the phone when we look at figures and see whether you need to go on another inhaler as well oh awesome thank you have you got any questions um no that's fine yeah thank you very much thanks a lot bye you say hello
