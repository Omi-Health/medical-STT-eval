Have you had any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all? Yeah well I'm wearing wearing sunglasses right now it's just you know lights really hurting my eyes. Oh I see okay and you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous have you vomited at all yeah I vomited twice twice okay and this earlier today okay um any temperatures or fevers um no I don't feel feverish okay um any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed no I haven't noticed anything like that okay um fine um and do you normally get headaches? Not really prone to them no no but I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago. Okay and what happened then? Just similar. How long did it last for? A couple of days. Did you do anything that made it better? Yeah I had to take painkillers and had to go to bed and rest and yeah couple days of work and work in the fashion industry and you know wondering what's going on like take sick days to work today but you know what if it is a brain tumor what's gonna happen with my future and my career you know about this never had headaches like this now yeah sure I can see your concerns obviously there's a lot of worry there but you know let's take it step by step and see exactly what the causes headaches are first. I'm just gonna ask you some very yes no questions that's okay. Have you noticed any problems with your speech at all? Any difficulty with your words? No. Any problems with your arms and legs? For example numbness or weakness? No. Any difficulty with balance your balance or coordination no okay and have you got any injuries to your head have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head okay all right right and you feeling otherwise okay so for example your breathing is okay you not feeling breathless or no okay. Do you have any other medical history I should be aware of? No. So for example if you had if anyone told you've had migraines in the past? No. My mum has migraines but I've not been diagnosed. Right, so my next question was about family history. Is there anything in the family, so apart from migraines, is there anything else, anything related to the brain? Thyroid as well. What was that, sorry? My mum has an underactive thyroid as well. Underactive thyroid as well, okay. Okay, any other problems, for example, the brain or, you mentioned brain cancer, any other family history of that? No. No, okay. In terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis? I take the pill, microgynone. Okay, and how long have you been on that for? Three months. Three months, okay. And is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else? It's for contraception. Okay, all right. That's something we may need to have a little discussion about today as well. My next question was about your social, your situation at home. You mentioned you work in a fashion industry, is your job quite stressful at the moment? Yeah it's really stressful actually. I'm having problems with people at work, managers putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver and yeah it's not a good time. Is it getting you down? I don't feel down, just feel a bit stressed. right and what kind of things you do to alleviate your stress normally? Nothing really. Do you do much in the way of exercise? No. Who's at home with you? I live on my own. Are you coping okay at the moment Fine Do you smoke at all No And do you drink much in a way of alcohol No Okay all right So normally as I said I kind of proceed to examination But based on your story I wonder whether you may have a migraine migraine headache It sounds very classical of that nature, the headache on one side, the throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, sensitive to bright lights. I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious such as meningitis or indeed brain cancer. I know that was a big worry of yours initially. Thank you. Thanks so much. I was so worried that I had cancer. And now you say migraine. Yeah, I guess my mum had similar symptoms to me. Yeah. It doesn't make sense. Well I hope that puts your mind at ease. Certainly this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month so I think moving forwards there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important and to see exactly what's triggering these headaches. We should also try and treat your headaches today and some strong painkillers would be advisable. So you know I think about paracetamol or even cocodamol and some anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen and naproxen. How does that sound to you? Okay, that sounds good. And, you know, if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we can maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place, something, you know, prophylactic medicines. Okay. Then we can have a discussion next time I see you next week, perhaps. Okay. Okay. Now, a couple of things I want you to think about is, you know, if your symptoms aren't getting better in the next two, three days, or indeed they're getting worse, I'd like you to come back and see me straight away if possible. So if your headache's getting worse and not responding to medications, or your neck pain is getting worse, or you're developing any weakness in your arms and legs, or your vision, then I want you to come back and see me straight away. Okay? Okay. Does that sound all okay? Doctor, that's great. Great. Any questions for me? No, thank you. Okay, have a good day. okay thanks bye
