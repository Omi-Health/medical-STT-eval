Hello? Hello there. Hello, can you hear me okay? Yes, I can hear you. Okay, great. Are you your doctor? I am, yes. Dr. Seed here, Oscar. How can I help you this afternoon? I'm contacting you because I've been quite short of breath lately. Okay. Do you want to tell me a bit more about it? When did it all start? Well it seems to have been slowly getting worse over the last couple of weeks. It's become quite troublesome in the last few days. I kind of, normally I can walk to the shops without a problem but now I'm having to sort of sit down and catch my breath and I'm even starting to get a bit breathless just about the house and it's got me kind of worried. I don't really know what's going on. Okay, is there anything you're particularly worried about? Well I've got heart failure, I was told that a while ago and I got a bit breathless when I was first diagnosed and put on some medicine that helped but I'm a bit worried it's getting worse. Right okay so you mentioned you've been feeling short of breath for the last couple of weeks but mainly the last couple of days has got a bit worse and you're now feeling more breathless on kind of minimal exertion you mentioned. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all with your breath? So for example any pain in your chest? No pain in my chest. Okay. Have you found yourself coughing at all? I've got a bit of a dry cough but it's not too troublesome. Okay. Okay. And how's your general health otherwise? Are you feeling weak, lethargic? I'm feeling a little run down but otherwise pretty normal. I've noticed my ankles have got bigger. Okay what do you mean by that? It's just like they've sort of swollen up a bit. Okay is that both ankles? Yeah both ankles yeah it's a bit embarrassing. Okay I can imagine yeah and again over how long has this have you noticed this for? I kind of noticed it the last few days. Last few days okay and is this something that you've had before in the past? I think my ankles did swell up a bit last time the heart failure was a problem Okay okay Fine okay So just to really recap so really the last couple of weeks you been feeling breathless but worse in the last couple of days. You mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough and some swelling in your ankles, but importantly no chest pain. And have you noticed your heartbeat racing at all, so palpitations or skipped heartbeat? No, not really. Okay. And any temperatures or fevers? No. Okay. And how about your appetite? Are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, that's fine. Okay. And your waterworks? Are you passing urine okay? Yeah, I usually pee a lot. Yeah. The drugs. Sure. Okay. All right. fine so moving on to your past medical history you mentioned heart failure any any other medical history I should be aware of well I was told I had like they called it like a small heart attack about five years ago I had like chest pain and they took me to hospital okay and they but then I just got better okay when you say small heart attack did they give you a name for what happened and the name of a diagnosis I can't remember it just called it something like that a small heart attack okay was it like angina or no they they said they it seen it was like more than angina okay but I didn't but I only had to stay in hospital for a few days okay and yeah I've been okay since then you've been okay since then okay all right so apart from the heart the heart problems the heart failure any other problems I should be aware of no I think I'm otherwise I'm okay okay do you take any regular medications apart from your diuretics that you're taking do you know which ones yeah I take something called ferrozemide. Do you know which dose you're taking? I can't remember I'm sorry doctor I have to check. No problems any other medications? yeah I take aspirin okay and Zoprolol that metoprolol was it Zoprolol sorry the connection is not very good okay thank you yep Simbastatin okay All right Any allergies at all Any medications No, no allergies. Okay. Is there anything in the family that's important for me to know? Any family history of medical problems, heart problems, lung problems? My father died of a heart attack. I'm sorry to hear that. How old was your father when he passed away? He was early 60s. Anything else I should be aware of? My mother had osteoporosis. okay your mother still with us? yes she's still living. okay all right and socially sir just tell me a bit more about your situation at home who lives at home with you? I live on my own and I've got two cats. You've got two cats okay great do you have names? They're my family they're called they're called Holly and Tim okay so this is junior cats and in terms of day to day are you working at the moment I work part-time as a lorry driver okay and how is that quite stressful long hours it's okay I yeah like when I'm working it's pretty exhausting. I guess I'm a bit worried that if I get sick I won't if I get more sick then I won't be able to work properly. Yeah it's certainly a consideration isn't it so let's let's try and get you better soon so it doesn't have any impact on your on your job. And do you find yourself doing a lot of antisocial hours? Do you do a lot of night driving, weekend driving? No I only take shifts during the day I don't like working at night. Okay, alright. And what about smoking and alcohol? Because they can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems. Do you smoke at all? Not anymore. So you used to smoke? Yeah. How many did you smoke a day on average? Oh, it was about a pack a day. Back in the day. And how many years was that for? oh that was good 25 years okay well done for stopping i asking very difficult for you but well done for stopping um and what about alcohol i don don drink alcohol Do you do much in the way of exercise then I try and walk to the shops at least once a day but that's about it. I don't get running like I used to when I was young. Right and certainly now your symptoms you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the the shop she said um right so um based on your based on your history and having listened to your story i wonder whether you've had a flare-up of your heart failure sir um which can sometimes happen um um and you know it's what's going on so it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be um and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure there's obviously um it's the first thing that comes to my mind um now there's a couple of options to move forward um given that you're otherwise well at the moment and having examined you your chest and your saturations and blood pressure all okay i'm quite happy to increase your dose of furosemide maybe rather than one tablet day we can give you two tablets today for the first few days um and see and see how you're getting on okay if you think that would be best i think i think it's definitely worth treating your symptoms but what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart to see how well your heart's pumping okay is that something you've had yeah so an echo scan it's a jelly scan of your heart you may have had it done before when you're diagnosed and it's just to get a good sorry uh yeah i remember now okay fine that's something i can organize for you today and it may take a week or two weeks for that to be organized but i think certainly in the meantime let's um let's let's get a blood test done we can check your um you know your full blood count look for signs of anemia we can have a check your kidney function um and we can definitely increase your um your fruizamide uh to you know one tablet twice a day but i really like we'd like you to come back and see him in about a week's time to see how you're getting on does that sound reasonable i think that sounds like a good plan and of course in the meantime if you are getting more unwell so if you're getting more breathless or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness then you know said i want you to give me a call sooner than that and we can have a chat on the phone as well okay i'll see how i get on okay do you have any questions for me uh that's all pretty clear thank you very much doctor great no i wish you all the best have a good day see you soon okay thank you
