Hi there, good morning, or good afternoon sorry. Hello there, good afternoon. Hi, this is Dr. Dean Miser from GP at hand. Hi there. Hi, so before we start your appointment, could I please confirm your full name and date of birth? Yes, my name is Jack Armani. That's a great thing. date of birth is 12 August 1958. That's great, thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yes I am. Okay, so how can I help you today? I am, so I woke up this morning and... Hello. Yeah, I'm still here. I'm a bit worried because I woke up this morning about an hour ago and I couldn't move my left arm anymore. Okay. And how is your arm right now? Well, like I feel no pain, but just can't move it. So you still can't move. And what time did you wake up? You said it was an hour. Are you sure about that? Yes. Okay. Now, can I just double check? Has this ever happened before? No. No. It's really the first time. Okay. And did you sleep anything in an awkward position or in a different bed or anything like that last night? No Everything as usual okay and is there any discoloration in your hand No Does your hand feel cold? Not really. The arm feels fine apart from me not being able to move it. Okay. And on your left side, have you had any symptoms in your left leg at all? Not. But I feel a bit of tingling on the left side of my face. Right, okay. And how long has that tingling been there for? Since I woke up, since I started to feel the thing, since the arm really stopped moving, so an hour ago. Okay, now I can't see you, it's a telephone appointment, but have you noticed any kind of asymmetry in your face or did your face expression look different on one side compared to the other? Anything different at all? Not really, just having a bit of issues, like I was trying to drink earlier and I dribbled a bit and tingling on the left side. Okay, so you had some difficulties swallowing, is that right? Yeah. Any problems with your speech? Is your speech different to how it sounds normally? Yeah it feels a bit hard It more complicated maybe I be more slow I need to think more about it Okay Is there anyone at home with you No. Okay. Is this something I should be worried about? Well, I'm concerned that some of the symptoms you've got may be symptoms of a stroke. Okay. Wow. So that's something that can be dealt with but it needs to be dealt with as an emergency in the hospital Should I call that would you be able to call the ambulance for me? I'm happy to do that What we need to do is to make sure that they've got access to you when you come so Maybe you could leave the front door Unlocked sit in the hallway, but I'm gonna arrange one of my colleagues next to me to call an ambulance to your home address now okay okay thank you that's being done right now as we speak while we're waiting for that I'm just gonna ask you a few more questions is that okay sure okay do you have any other illnesses at all I have type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure okay and are you on any medication for that I'm taking melformin, Lothartan and amlodipine. Okay, do you have any allergies to any medication? Only penicillin I believe. Okay. Are there any illnesses in your family at all? My dad has got heart disease but I don know more detail Okay anyone else Not really And are you normally living alone Yes Do you smoke at all I used to Okay how much alcohol do you drink? I will have a few drinks over the weekend maybe a couple more during the week. So what drinks are we talking about? Beers like pints. Okay all right how are you feeling now? Have you got the symptoms right now still? the arm yes yes the the arm so can't move and I think the speech is getting a bit harder okay all right so the ambulance is on his way all right and what they're going to do is they'll probably take you down to the local hospital A&E and they will ring through for the stroke doctor to assess you to see whether they can give you any kind of treatment for that okay so okay don't worry they're on their way um and what i'm going to do is i'm going to stay on the line until they reach there just to make sure that you're okay okay is there anything i should be doing now uh not at the moment no not at the moment just uh make sure that the the front door is open sit in the hallway by the front door so that they've got access if need to be if for any reason you can't open the front door okay okay OK. All right, then. So I'm just going to stay on the line, and we'll wait until the ambulance comes. OK, I'm going to go to the door. OK, then. All right. Thank you. Thank you. OK, bye bye. Bye.
