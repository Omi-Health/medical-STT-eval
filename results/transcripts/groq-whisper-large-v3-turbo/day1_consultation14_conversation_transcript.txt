Hello? Hello. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your date of birth? Yeah, my name is April and I'm 50. You're 50, okay. April, how can I help you this afternoon? Well, I've just been having this cough for quite a few days and my nose is running. It's just been super annoying and it's not going away. When did it all start? I think it started like maybe a bit less than a week ago like maybe maybe five or six days ago. Okay and you mentioned a couple of things there you mentioned a cough you mentioned a bit of a runny nose right? Yeah. Okay let's focus on your cough first can you tell me a bit more about your cough? It's just so continuous it's really really frustrating it's quite dry and it's just all day like keeps me up at night as well which is really annoying. Okay so it's a dry cough so You don't bring up any mucky phlegm or anything like that. No. Okay. So it keeps you up at night. You mentioned the cold symptoms as well, the runny nose. Do you have a sore throat as well? I mean, the coughing is giving me a sore throat, but it's not like, you know, not more than that. you know just just my throat is irritated from coughing but it's not like it's not that bad when I swallow or anything right do you have any um do you are you how are your ears your ears feel blocked no they feel okay actually yeah no pain or discharge from your ears no pain not pain on the ears okay all right um fine in terms of your breathing um how is your breathe how's your chest is your breathing more labored? I don't think so like I guess like it's labored when I'm coughing and I can't breathe but like not yeah I don't think so. When you walk around you don't feel breathless? I don't feel breathless no I feel you know generally tired okay yeah but not not anything special with my chest. Any pain in your chest? No not that either. Okay you You mentioned feeling tired. Have you felt feverish at all? Have you had a temperature? I been having like shivers even when I in bed You know like when you go to sleep and you feel like I should be warm but I still still you know shivering a little bit my temperature so I not 100 sure if I had a fever but it feels like I probably did because I was just I was next to my boyfriend and he was completely warm and totally fine and I just like couldn't stop shivering and kept adding more sweaters on and I was still cold no idea okay okay all right um fine in terms of any other symptoms have you had any nausea have you had any vomiting no no no nausea no vomiting like um yeah nothing like that how's your appetite um i mean it's okay i at the beginning like when i was starting to have this the coughing and stuff. I had a little bit of diarrhea but it didn't cut my appetite or anything I just like my stomach wasn't feeling great. Okay has that got better now the diarrhea? Yeah yeah it got better it was only like the first like it started at the same time as the cough started and then it stopped so I thought everything would be fine but then the coughs just stopped going. Okay fine. Any problems with your water works at all? With my what? Your water works, your urine. Oh, no, no, no, that's fine. You're passing urine okay? You're drinking plenty of fluids and passing urine okay? No, I drank loads of water when I started having the diarrhea. Now that it stopped, I just went back to normal. Okay, all right. In terms of any other things, do you notice any funny skin rashes or problems with your muscles or joints? When I was telling you I had chills and I was really cold, my muscle was really hurting. I don't want to do Pilates but it's hurting me so much at the moment. To be honest all I feel like doing is just lying in bed. Right, okay. Sorry that must be really difficult for you. Yeah, especially in my arms, my legs, just everywhere basically. We're getting quite lethargic and weak mentioned. Yeah, pretty much. Okay, and April are you normally otherwise fit and well? Am I normally what? Fit and well. So do you have any other medical history? Well I have type 2 diabetes. Okay. And I have quite high blood pressure Okay and what do you take for your blood pressure What medications do you take on a regular basis I take metformin for the diabetes and I take lisinopril for the high blood pressure. Okay fine. Any allergies at all to medication? No allergies. No, okay. Regarding any family history, is there anything I should be aware of? My dad also has type two diabetes but I think that's it. Who's looking after your diabetes? Do you have a doctor in hospital? I just regularly go see a doctor and just checks up on it same with the high blood pressure like I have it under control and since I started taking this medication I've just been like regularly checking that it's it's under control. Great excellent. In terms of your social situation who lives at home with you? It's just me and my partner. Okay fine is your partner well at the moment? Yeah he has none of it like he's just going ahead like like nothing nothing like I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him but right okay not diary nothing he's fine oh wait he's got away with it at the moment okay and are you working at the moment april uh yeah i am working but the first day i skipped because because i was feeling just too yeah but then i just felt like hard to go back because i had so much to do i've been going in but it's not been fun no i can imagine what is it that you do for work I am a developer. So you work in the IT field okay. Yeah, work in IT. IT field right okay. It's not too active a job. No, have you been quite stressful recently? Not more than usual, I don't think it's related to stress like I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work. The reason I ask is I've been able to take a day off to try and recovered so yeah I don't think they did. So the reason I ask is sometimes stress can really affect your immune system but it's good to know you're not feeling stressed. Do you smoke at all April? I used to but I've stopped for about six months now. Okay and what about alcohol? I mean yeah I don't think I drink that much like I don't really know how you count the units but I guess like I don drink more than like like say three evenings a week and I rarely get like properly drunk or anything And what is it that you drink Wine mostly How much do you drink on those nights I say like maybe two or three glasses Okay so um yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of um the recommended limit. Something that you think about just because of your blood pressure and diabetes maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can yeah how much do you think i should cut down on it really ideally the right answer is to cut down completely but so in practice i know that's not realistic so maybe for the first few weeks why don't you cut down to two glasses a week and then one week thereafter um and if you are coping okay then we can maybe try and cut down altogether okay okay just something for you to think about um right so uh just as we wrap up really um april i think based on your story i think essentially i think you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness um i don't think there's anything to worry about you know you've had a bit of a cough bit of a runny nose feeling quite weak and lethargic i'm hoping that you know you're probably over the worst of it now it's been five days i'm hoping you're maybe going to get better the next couple of days normally last about a week to 10 days what what should i do if it just keeps going on and on like if it's still going on in say four days yeah absolutely so you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to you know get some nice good rest drink plenty of fluids keep yourself well hydrated you can take regular paracetamol if you feel like it's still not getting any better in two to three days it's probably worth coming back to see me again we can check you over and if you are still feeling feverish and your cough isn't getting any better then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest which can sometimes be a common source of infection. Do you think I should keep going to work or do you think I should just? Yeah so I think it really I think it depends on you it's if you are coughing then there is a risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still so I would say maybe take a day or two of work if you can and get some good bed rest and maybe think about work early next week. Okay, okay. But if your cough isn't getting any better or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner, okay? Okay, but otherwise I don't need to worry. No, no, nothing to worry about otherwise. Okay, alright, thank you very much. Have a good day, appreciate it. Thank you, bye.
