Have you coughed up any blood or anything like that? Nope. And what about your nose symptoms? On the front of your sinuses or anything? Nothing up in here, but just constant streaming, like using a million tissues. And any blood coming from the nose? No, it's pretty green. Right, okay. Any other symptoms like sore ears, sore throat? I've been feeling really hot. I don't know if it's fever as such, but to touch I'm quite hot, but sometimes I feeling really chilly and needing to be under a blanket that sort of thing Have you checked your temperature with a thermometer No I haven Okay and are you eating and drinking normally Yes kind of around when it started I had some diarrhoea but I don't know if that was associated but since then it's all been pretty fine. Okay so you're drinking while holding down fluids okay? Yeah. And passing water okay? Yeah that's fine vomiting diarrhea now okay that's fine um any rashes that you've noticed rashes yeah uh no nothing like that any headaches or change in your vision no um i've had quite achy muscles but that's pretty much it okay and normally do you have any chest problems No. Do you ever get wheezing, short of breath? I mean like if I do intense exercise, yes, but not normally. And do you regularly have any infections in your chest or anything that needs treatment normally? No, I've got hypertension, so I'm on some drugs for that, but that's it really. Okay. Any other medical problems? Just the hypertension and the diabetes. Okay, and what type of drugs are you on? I think something called metformin and lisinapril I think is the other one. Okay, and when did you last have your blood pressure checked? A while ago. Do you know if it's unstable? I can't remember. Okay and with your diabetes have you had a blood test recently? Yeah like yeah it was normal it was around three weeks ago Okay and do you know what dose of the Lysinopril you taking 200 Okay have you been able to pass water normally any increase in the frequency that you passing water or any increase in thirst? No not particularly. And has your weight been stable? Yeah. What is your weight and height? My height is five foot five and and my weight is 65 kilograms. Okay. And do you smoke at all? No. Do you drink any alcohol? Yes, the odd sherry. Okay. And who do you live with at home? My partner and my dog. And do you work? Yes. I'm an office manager. Okay. And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms, anything that you've got in the chemist? Quite a few LEMZIPS, they seem to be helping. What do you mean by quite a few? How many in a day do you normally take? Maybe two or three, maybe like at the start of the day and at the end of the day. Okay, have you noticed any improvement in that? Yeah, it tends to soothe my throat a bit when I'm going to sleep. Okay. Do you have any allergies to anything? I sometimes suffer from some hay fever. Any allergies to any medications at all? Not that I'm aware of, no. Okay. So what you've described to me, it sounds like you probably have got an infection in the chest because you're obviously getting the symptoms from your nose and your chest. It sounds like you might have it at high temperatures, it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature. Okay I can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something Yeah most of the time these infections are caused by viruses so they do normally settle by themselves but it can take a week or two and you can consistently have the cough ongoing longer than that. The important thing to do would be to check your temperature and if you feel like if the temperature is ongoing above 37.5 38 and you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down or your coughs getting worse you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out your nose and or any shorts of brain chest pain then we certainly would need to speak to you again with the diabetes you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes so it's something that we do need to be careful of okay so then we would look at potentially antibiotics at that time perhaps yeah potentially if it is if it's not settling or the temperatures on going getting worse and we definitely need to talk to you again okay um have you got any other questions um no that's all fine it's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment with the lem sip I wouldn't take and that's that contains paracetamol so don't take any other paracetamol containing products and with that at the same time the cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime it's best for your body if you just keep coughing but if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all then it's okay to have a little bit of cough syrup just to settle that down okay okay you have blood sugar checking equipment? Not at home. Well if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your GP has asked you for. Okay great all right then take care. Thanks very much, bye.
