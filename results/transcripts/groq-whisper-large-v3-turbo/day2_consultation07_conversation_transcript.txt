No they're still present. Okay so you've still got the chest discomfort right now? Yes. Okay We're probably gonna have to call an ambulance for you today okay okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna task my colleague next to me to sort that out while we do that I gonna ask you a few more questions okay Sure A bit more information to the ambulance team when they when they arrive okay so just just to double check where exactly in the chest is the pain um it's in the middle of my chest over yeah my pecs so yeah but not not necessarily to one side I mean it's quite a diffuse pain is it spreading anywhere else like down to your arm up to the jaw and the neck like that? Yeah it's mainly in my left arm, it's feeling a little bit painful and in my shoulder as well. Right okay, do you remember what you were doing at the time? Yeah so it started just when I was gardening so nothing that was too strenuous, I was just kneeling down and yeah wasn't running or anything, I wasn't doing any physical exercise. Cool okay and how much activity do you do normally? Do you walk a lot or do you run or do you do anything? No, I don't. I generally don't do much activity at all. Yeah. Have you had this before? No, this is the first time actually. Right. Okay. Are you aware of any palpitations, like your heart beating faster or more prominently than normal? Yeah, it's beating a bit faster now. I think that's because I'm a little bit stressed about the situation but I haven't noticed it beating faster than usual today. So I know you're stressed we've got an ambulance coming on the way okay yeah we'll take care of everything so don't worry. Are you in the house with you at the moment? No no one's in the house at the moment. Okay and is your front door open? Yes it's open.
