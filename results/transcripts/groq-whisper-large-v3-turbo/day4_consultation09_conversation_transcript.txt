And so you were born in 92, so it makes you 26. 26, yeah. And you are, any shortness of breath at all? yeah like a little bit um yeah a little bit short of breath not too bad any cough wheeze yeah i'm feeling a bit wheezy as well because it's coughing coughing yeah like cough yeah yeah sore throat runny nose sore ears you know i had a cold last week and it's not as bad as it was but yeah i had a sore throat i had a runny nose Just under the weather You feeling better now on the tight chest I mean I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore Right, okay, okay, but you know you've got this this so you still got still got symptoms of a cold essentially Yeah, the coughs kind of stuck around Are you coughing up anything I know and do you have any other medical problems like asthma yeah yeah I have asthma I've had it for a while now and then I have like a hay fever you know some allergies dust okay you have any inhalers or or any medications? Yeah, so you know the Ventolin, it's called Salbutamol. Yeah. I got that one and then I have a steroid, Clenol, Clenol inhaler. Clenol modulate, yeah, okay. Yeah yeah Have you been using Clenol and the Ventolin and how often you been using them um well to be honest I was away at uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me so I haven't really in the past week both because it because I'm sorry they ran out tonight I forgot to go and grab the next one yeah sure about a week okay all right all right so so you so you you haven't got any cleaner or any ventolin at the moment not with me right now no i ran out okay all right um and any drug allergies you know no no not allergic to anything just like just the dust and stuff but nothing no drugs okay great now uh do you anyone in your family have any medical problems know of? Yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Oh, when I was young I also had eczema and I had a milk protein allergy when I was young too. Okay. Right, so just do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or hopes for this consultation? Not really. I feel like asthma is probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers wouldn't be helpful. It's just kind of scary because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight in a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I can imagine. Well, it certainly sounds like you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough, and it's non-productive cough and you're short of cough. Is the cough worse at night time? I mean it gets a little bit worse at night, but basically just pretty consistent. Yeah. It hasn't gone away. Okay. And you've got this tight chest. You can tell you've got chest pain, it's more of a tight chest, is it? No, not really pain. It's more like tight. It just feels like sometimes I can't get a full breath in, you know? Yeah, sure. Okay, well, I would quite like to certainly get you some Ventolin, clinical modulate. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit more, like back in high school but I been pretty good at taking my inhalers so not so much anymore Have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient as in you know stayed in there overnight for asthma Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat. Oh, okay. So you went to hospital and had a... So you stayed in hospital for a few days, did you, with an asthma exacerbation? Yeah, I did, yeah. Okay, but currently you're just on Ventolin and Clinol. and you haven't got any of those inhalers in the moment. I'd be pretty good. I'd be pretty good just on the clenol and the salbutamol. Okay. Sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation? I think I was like 17, 16 maybe. Sure. Okay. Just to quantify how short of breath you are, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you. no you won't have are you able to like walk up flight of stairs okay walk on the flat okay without getting too short of breath or are you short of breath of rest i'm definitely not short of breath at rest like except for that feeling i was describing it does when i'm walking upstairs i do feel like i have a little bit more short of breath than i would normally be sure yeah okay but not sure breath of rest at the moment no no no i'm not okay fine so what what i think um and just just go over is there anything you'd hoped about getting other than the uh a prescription for your inhalers was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting from this well i just want to know that i'm okay so just like keep i just don't want to have to get um that that intubation again sure yeah absolutely okay well i'm really glad you spoke to me today i think what we can do is is give you a prescription for some more of the inhalers we can get that to you within the hour i would hope um and uh i think what the other thing i'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids so this is these are tablets which um you can take for five days uh two tablets in the morning and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response okay okay um now there are some side effects to the steroids which I should really tell you about but please read the label as a social don't be too worried about the side effects there on most you know most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated and you probably do have you had them in the past you know sorry sorry you were cutting in and out a little bit there what are you saying have you had steroids in the past um I can remember probably probably yeah so um they they can come they can make you your mood change can be slightly low or slightly high can give you a high blood sugar and they can also cause rash, nausea, headaches but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help your asthma an awful lot. What I like to do is send you these, some prescriptions for your inhalers are ongoing so you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can use the clinal modulate in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN but so a Ventolin when you need to when you're getting ready if you should start to use the Ventolin more than every three hours at any time it's a good idea to seek medical attention so see a doctor in some capacity and the other thing I'd like to send you as a spacer which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better have you do you know what spacer is have you used one before yeah yeah i somebody told me how to use it on a while ago i don't i don't really use it to be honest but have you got one i think i do i have one somewhere okay all right well um i'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it but essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside breathing in and out for five or ten breaths. Okay. Yeah. So was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage? I think you got me covered. Okay. And I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better if you're okay with that. All right? All righty. Well, thank you very much. No worries. Any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath, or just generally concerning symptoms, pain in your chest, tightness, feeling lightheaded, then seek further medical attention and . Okay? All right, sounds good. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.
