next door. Hello? Can you hear me okay? Yeah I can hear you. Right excellent before I go any further can I confirm your name and your age please? Sure I'm Amanda Jackson and I'm 19 years old. 19 years old okay Amanda and how can I help you this afternoon? So it's been going on for a few days now, it's not happened before and I'm a bit worried, it hurts when I kind of pee and yeah it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more and it's really like I can't like go to uni properly, I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet and it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in the bottom of my tummy as well. Right, I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you. So you mentioned you've been going on for the last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. You said you're going to the toilet more often as well, is that right? Yeah, it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days, I think actually, maybe just under a week. Oh, under a week, sorry. Okay. Sorry, no, I didn't explain it properly before. Yeah, no, it's been going on for about just under a week. and yeah I noticed burning stinging when I go to the toilet Have you noticed anything in your urine? For example any blood or discolouration of urine? I think well today I noticed it was like a bit pink the urine I think just today Have you noticed any kind of frank blood? I mean red blood at all in your urine? I think it was mixed in probably, I don't know it was pink so. Okay fine we'll definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on. You also mentioned some tummy pain as well, can you tell me a bit more about that pain? Yeah it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy, mainly when I go to the loo, I think that's when it's worse. Okay can you describe it as a crampy pain, is it more of a burning pain? I wouldn't describe it as crampy I don't think it's like a period pain it's a bit different it's it's hard to say an achy pain I suppose okay does the pain move anywhere else is move towards your back towards your sides no no okay all right any other symptoms so if you talking about nausea vomiting No no nausea vomiting Any temperatures or fevers No, not that I've noticed. Okay, alright. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working okay? I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any different from what it usually is. What kind of problems do you normally have? I think I have IBS, so I just kind of pass my bowels quite a lot and sometimes it's quite variable like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, sorry this is a bit disgusting but sometimes it's a bit harder and it's kind of hard to predict. But you've noticed no new symptoms in your bowels? No, no, not that I've noticed. Alright, and Amanda sometimes we have to ask quite a sensitive question as you can imagine. Can I ask, are you currently sexually active at the moment? Yeah, I have a long term boyfriend. Okay and have you noticed any other discharge from down below so from the front passage? No I don't think so, nothing unusual. Okay do you use any form of contraception? Yeah I'm on the pill. What kind of pill is it? Is it a combined pill or the mini pill? Combined pill. Okay fine. When was the last time you had unprotected sex? I mean unprotected is in like no condoms or anything. Yeah exactly. I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend. I don't know we've just kind of agreed. agreed. So I guess a week ago, two weeks ago. What I'm trying to get at is whether there's any chance you could be pregnant at all. I know you're on the pill but nonetheless we do have to ask. When was your last period? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, okay all right. Just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms don get any better okay Fine In terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you eating and drinking okay Yeah yeah eating and drinking okay I did have one kind of concern I don know So I smoked, this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time like a week and a half ago. I just wonder whether it's related at all, probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you sure well thanks for sharing with me um so i don't think it is related to your symptoms i think it's probably just pure coincidence um but uh you know i do strongly advise you to you know make it a regular habit if you can um just for your general health moving forwards okay um moving on in terms of your health otherwise do you have any other medical conditions apart from the ibs is there anything else i should be aware of No. No. Okay. Great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the combined pill? Apart from the pill, I take something for the IBS as well. It begins with an M, it's really hard to pronounce, like mebe something. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, that's right. Okay, and then after the cramps, the crampy pain. Yeah. Yeah. And do you have any allergies, any medications? Yeah I think there was an antibiotic called clindamycin that I took like a couple years ago and yeah that didn't go too well with me. Right, okay sure, I'll make an oar to that. In terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? No. No, don't need anything else. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation, who's at home with you? So I am living in halls at the moment, at uni, so I'm just living with a flatmate I suppose. But my family live kind of outside of London, not too far away, so yeah, my family are fine and I see them now and then. Very good. Yeah, things I think are okay, generally. Great, and what are you studying at university? I'm studying English. English, okay, good. And how are you enjoying your course? Yeah, it's going well, thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago. Yeah, I really enjoy it. In terms of smoking and alcohol do you participate in either As I admitted before I tried weed the first time but I don smoke I drink occasionally kind of socially, with friends. What made you have your first joint last week? I was just a party. There were other people doing it. I kind of was a little bit tipsy, so probably wasn't thinking quite straight. But, yeah, I completely agree. It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure. And obviously, as you're talking to something, I took off to you, so I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid it. Great. Fine. So, at this stage, I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think, you know, I'm reassured by the fact that I think it's probably just a simple what we say UTI or cystitis bladder infection you know you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about so things like fevers and back pain would be more worrying for me to hear so something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics so we've got a choice of two antibiotics something called trimethoprine or nitrofurantoin which is a three-day course normally they're usually quite effective for your symptoms it's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well if you can so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there start the antibiotics make sure you're well hydrated drink plenty of fluids if you are having some pain simple paracetamol would probably be advisable. We'll see what the urine sample shows and if it is indeed positive we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones but if things are still looking any better next week come back and see me and we can have another look again. Okay okay great with the urine sample and how do I go about doing that? So I will organise for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices which we can test there and then. And then we can always get back in touch with you with the results. Okay, perfect. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call, okay? Fever, back pain, vomiting, great. obviously great okay yeah okay have a good day okay thank you you too
