Hi. Hello. Hi. Hi, I'm Maria. Hello, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. How are you doing? I'm all right, thank you. I feel a little weird today, to be honest. Yeah, so just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your full name for me, please? yes Maria Trabalotsa okay and your date of birth that is the 1st of October 99 okay and your email address for me please yes mtraba at gmail.com okay and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we have a confidential conversation Yes, I think I am. Yeah. Good. Right. You've mentioned in your patient notes that you're having some sort of lip swelling after you had a sandwich. Is that correct? Yeah, that is, well, I don't think it was, it wasn't a sandwich, but it was something with Crohn. So basically I sometimes go with my friends to this place called Vet Park and we regularly have, like usually I have like a normal vegetarian soup or something and yeah and then I wanted to try something new. So what happened was I ordered a prawn soup. It's called a laksa, it's like soup. I ordered a prawn one this time. Yeah. And then my lips started feeling a little weird, just in the corner, sort of on the left first. And then I don know and then we went back we had a little bit of a chat a banter of banter I wasn really paying attention now I feel that that there is a swelling yeah there is like a swelling on my on my upper lip and it kind of getting bigger I don't know what to do all right so when did you have the prawn soup what time that was that must have been just after work so maybe like around around 7. Okay, around 7 o'clock. And how long did it take to develop the swelling? Well, I wasn't really paying attention, so it must have been like, must have been like, I don't know, half an hour maybe? Okay, in half an hour you developed the swelling, yeah? Yeah. Okay, and it's getting bigger and bigger? Yeah, I still feel it like really pumping blood and it's kind of getting bigger it feels like it's getting worse. Okay so just a few more questions. So you mentioned about your swelling of your lips, is there any feeling of swelling in your throat, like your throat is closing up, any feeling like that? Yeah actually I feel like I can't breathe that well right now. Okay. And do you feel like your chest is tight? I don't know if it's the chest, it's just generally feels a little difficult. Okay. But yeah, it might be, I'm not sure. Okay, right. And just a few, have you ever had any kind of lip swelling in the past? Are you eating any food? Yeah well maybe I remember like a year ago a year ago I was out with my friends and I think we went like to a late night kind of Chinese place and I remember that I was quite drunk to be honest And I remember that after like having that very late I woke up the next morning quite swollen up and had also like okay felt really bad and quite difficult breathing but I don't know what it was I had it was like a curry or something okay and what did you take at that time did you use anything like antihistamine or anything when you had that last time well i generally have asthma so i tell i i take oh what's it called salbutamol inhalers yeah yeah so i do take that regularly but i've always taken it i generally have asked and any other inhalers is it just the salbutamol that you use any other brown inhalers oh no I don't think so no okay right and so do you use anti-histamines like cetrazine loratidine peritone any of those kind of things oh I think sometimes I don't know which ones so I have a peanut allergy as well I've always had it. I think I do get antihistamines for that but I'm not sure which ones. And any point, because you had peanut allergy, any time you had to ever use like an injection? When I was a kid, I think I remember my mom told me about it but I don't know what it was because I was small and I changed doctors since. Right. Has your mom ever said that you had to go to hospital because you had a severe allergic reaction? Yeah, when I was like six or something, I think, oh, sorry, the swelling is getting, oh, yeah, I think when I was six. Are you okay now? I feel busy right now, to be honest. you feel busy okay right do you have any kind of antihistamines with you at the moment No I don think I have Right, okay. Right, all right. I'm really a bit worried about you at the moment, Maria. I think we need to call an ambulance because from what history you've been telling me, it sounds like you could be going into what we say an an apathalactic reaction that's when your throat and your chest you know closes in and you might need an injection like what your mom's you know what your mom told you as you were a young child okay right so is there any anyone with you at the moment or are you alone I'm alone at the moment so hang on the line while I'll call the ambulance okay and I'll send them right to you okay and somebody just came so just call the ambulance make sure that person's with you till the ambulance comes yeah because we are worried about an anaphylactic reaction so you need to go straight away could you ask the person whether they have any antihistamines around in the interim while we're waiting yes uh mom mom do we have any ideas around yes yes yeah we do straight away and if mom can call mom if you can call the uh 999 999 yeah and say that your there is a suspected anaphylactic reaction and they need to come straight away okay yes she said she will yes so it's great to be take the anti-historic in the meantime all right okay okay you come up from the hospital do give us a ring back we might need to sort you out um with your injections and things like that okay yes yes i'll do yes okay then take care thank you very much bye
