Hello, can you hear me okay? Yes, I can. Can you hear me? Yeah, good, good. So my name is Joe. I'm a doctor here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? My name is Vincent. And your date of birth? 9th of May 2016. Okay, great. I know you're in a safe place, oh sorry, a safe and confidential place to talk and just have to go ahead with the consultation. Yes, yes I am. Great, so how can I help? Yeah, so I have a call that I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week and it's been causing me problems. I've had to stay away from work for about three or four of those days because of our badness. Okay I'm sorry to hear that so you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week and what came what came first? The sore throat came first and then after a day or two the cough. Okay okay and are you coughing up anything? No it's very dry. Okay so I'm just going to ask a few questions about the your current symptoms and then a little bit about your background and something I suspect what we can do a little bit later on in the consultation to help you. Before I go on, anything you're particularly concerned about or have any ideas what might be going on? You said you had a cold. Well, I mean, you know how we all know. Once this happens, you Google it and it seems to be all kinds of bad things. It could be a cold or flu, obviously because the cancer always comes up so it'll be good if none of those right so yeah I can provide a little bit of reassurance and we can talk about those a little bit as well and was there anything you're particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation well yeah so reassurance so like hopefully some sense that's not anything too serious but also if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better or any advice or maybe even a sick note so if i need to stay away from work for a bit longer i can get one sure sure okay all right so we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms and i'm sure we can get a those things uh sick and some reassurance um about your concerns so um you mentioned that you started with a sore throat about a week ago developed into a bit of a dry cough I just ask a few questions around those Do you have any shortness of breath? Yes, yes, I've been having shortness of breath. You are short of breath. And do you have any wheeze or chest pain? Yeah, a bit of both. You're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well? Yes. Okay. And how, when did you start to develop the shortness of breath? Let's see. So the sore throat, so today is Friday. The sore throat was about last week, Friday or Thursday. The cough was Saturday or Sunday. So the shortness of breath was, I think, shortly after the cough, cough so maybe a day or two later so three four days ago three or four days ago you started developing and is the cough worse at night time no no it's the same throughout the day and when you say you're short of breath just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are so are you able to like walk up a flight of stairs for example or are you short breath of rest oh yeah It's like when I'm doing walking and I do exercise now and then. So it hasn't been super bad. It hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual and a little bit worried. And you're a bit concerned about that. Okay. So I just need to ask a few things about your background as well. So do you have any other medical conditions or medical history? No, just no. No past medical history, no. No past medical history. No history of asthma? Nope. And any history of clots on your legs or your lungs? These are Dbps or Ps. No one in your family has had those, clots on the legs or lungs? Well, my mother had lung cancer. Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke? No. Have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos? I don't know if that's best to us ever smoked. I mean, once or twice in Amsterdam, if that counts, but not really. Okay. And this, just going back to your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough. It a dry cough no you not coughing up any phlegm Do you have and you say you don have any chest pain as such Are you taking any medications No, I'm not. Are you allergic to any medications? Not to any medication but I'm allergic to peanuts. Peanuts, okay. And you mentioned that your mother had lung cancer. Any other family history of any significant illnesses when running in your family? No, no, that's the only one, just lung cancer from my mother. Just lung cancer, okay. And you say you have a cold, so do you have sinus congestion or...? No, it seems to be all entirely with just my throat like my nose is Just your just your throat and any recent travel or have you always lived in the UK? No, so I Haven't always lived in the UK like so I was born in the US and moved over About 12 years ago, but it's a recent travel just to Europe nowhere to exotic Okay, so no significant recent travel anywhere. And are you coughing up anything other than, so you're not coughing up blood or anything like that? No, no. Good. And are you feeling feverish, hot, cold, sweaty? Yeah, so a little bit feverish at first, so the first three or so days of this, but then the fever's gone away. Okay. And in general, do you... I had a... Sorry? Yeah. Yeah, I was just going to say also had a bit of a headache. Like headaches that come and go rather, but like right now it's fine. Okay. And in general, would you say you're beginning to feel better, worse, or sort of staying the same? So it's like it's up and down. So let's see. So I started last week and I stayed home from work two days this week. I think it was maybe Tuesday and Thursday, so I felt better and then worse again and then better and then worse again. So it's been a kind of constant, but constant can be a variable stomach. Okay. And I just need to ask any other sort of risk factors that you may have. So no sort of significant weight loss or unexplained weight loss any waters So no weight loss but I have been losing my appetite recently I mean I usually eat a lot so I enjoy eating as well but that been a bit concerning You've been losing your appetite recently? Yes. And you're a little bit concerned about that. But you haven't lost any weight, do you think? No, not that much. And any sort of rashes or anything? No, no rashes. Okay. So I would ask to examine you now, but I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat at least to see if there's a... probably... Oh, we can try it. Oh, no. Well, no, it's okay. I might think about doing it. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck that you can feel? No, not the, no, okay. And so finally you were talking about, I mean it sounds to me that you've been a little bit up and down, sore throat, developed a dry cough, you are slightly short of breath but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end consultation now is if you feel significantly worse, if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness or breathlessness that you are concerned about, then I would advise you to see medical attention again, see a GP and actually see somebody physically. But I think for now I can sort of try and reassure you that if this clears up as I expect it would, so expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days if it's not please get in touch with the medical professional again and I would expect it to and so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis your concerns about lung cancer are was that the other thing you concerned about oh yeah yeah so so again if you're not getting better please see somebody again I've just got four seconds now so nice talking to you and we've got to tidy up yeah okay so and I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days of work and paracetamol lots of fluids and rest up and as I say if you're not feeling better please get in touch okay all right thank you
