Hello. Hi there. Hi, hi there. My name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors at Babylon. I just, can I confirm your name please? Hi there, yeah. My name is Brian. Sorry, your name was? My name was Brian. Brian, hi Brian. Nice to meet you. And your date of birth? birth? Yeah my date of birth is the 8th of August 1982. Great and are you in a sort of confidential place where you can speak freely? Yeah no no one else can hear me. Great and you're happy to continue with the consultation? Yes. Fabulous. Okay so how can I help today? Yeah so basically it's just been happening over the last few weeks or so. I don't really feel like getting up in the morning is really difficult and I don't have much energy at all during the day. Often, yeah, just like doing most things that I would normally find easy, it's become quite difficult. Okay, so things have become quite difficult for you. Yeah. Is there anything else? It's quite hard to say, like things like I'm not eating very much at the moment, I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy. Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had difficulty waking up, no energy, not eating, and that's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks, do you mean two or three or five? How about that? Now I think about it maybe even longer. I guess it might be related to it. So I also started a new job slightly recently. It might have even coincided with that job a couple of months ago. When did you start? You do have two months ago, you say? Yeah. Okay, and so this has been going on perhaps for sort of six weeks or so? More like two months I would say, yeah. Okay, alright, so is there anything that you're particularly sort of concerned about or hoping to get out of this consultation? Well I know that it not really normal for me So before this phase started happening you know I wouldn have any problems eating what I want to eat or doing standard things in life And what I want to do is like kind of return to that previous state somehow I not sure how that is what the best ways of doing that are but give some advice or whatever that'd be really useful okay sure okay well what I'd like to do is just ask you a few more sort of questions around what's been going on and also around your background health and things like that and then we can go on sort of what can be done from there is that right okay okay great so you say you've been feeling unwell with not a lot of energy difficult waking up in the mornings do you tend to just on that do you tend to wake up early and then stay in bed in the morning um actually I'm just not normally wake up early it's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all probably I think that's probably close. Difficulty sleeping as well. Yeah and have you and how has your mood been over this period? Have you been feeling... Restract I'd say. I kind of yeah finding it really hard to quite difficulty focusing I would say not unhappy or happy but just quite just not focused okay so difficulty focusing quite distracted and would you say you've been in good spirits or is your mood low Actually, now you mentioned it, my mood is a bit lower recently, and so my sex drive has decreased a bit over the past few months as well. So, yeah. and so lower mood decreased sex drive recently as well and just on that note there's a few questions around that are you able to maybe slightly personal questions but if you're okay to answer this do you to to have morning erections like you is that something that you've noticed I noticed anything like that specifically so you've not so you're saying you have not noticed morning infections and usually you would it's a normal thing to have waking up yes with something but you have not noticed those recently I have not noticed those recently okay so and that's been a change as it important one I don't think sorry yeah I don't think it's an important change no I so you don think there been a change there no there hasn been a change there Oh okay sorry Right sorry Okay so just going back to the mood symptoms as well you've had difficulty focusing, easily distracted. Your mood has been slightly lower with lower sex drive. Yeah. And in what way has your sex drive been lower? Are you in a relationship at the moment? Yeah, I'm married. I've been for many years and yeah just over the last few months just in disinterested okay sorry you froze there for a moment so less interested as well okay and just to ask you a few questions before we wrap up is any significant past medical history so do you suffer from any mental health problems in the past or any physical health problems no so in the past I have a history of hypothyroidism hypo hypothyroidism yeah I thyroid just to sort of confirm it sorry can you say that again please hyper as in high hyper thyroid hypo hypo okay hypo thyroid thank you thank you yeah and also in the past I mean I haven't had any kind of specific medical diagnoses along these lines but the suspicion that it may have had an impact on me but my father has committed suicide about 15 years ago okay okay and do you take any medications I have a drug history of thyroxine so maybe yes. Do you continue to take thyroxine now? Yes. You do? So you're taking thyroxine at the moment? Yes. Cool. Any drug allergies? Are you allergic to any medications? No, I have no medication allergies. No allergies. And you mentioned the suicide of your father 15 years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other significant family history of medical conditions or psychiatric conditions No No depression or anything like that running in family or No nothing of that sort Okay And your mother is well Any brothers or sisters Yeah, she's fine. And no, I'm an only child. Okay. Okay. So I just, sorry, it might be my slightly random question, but any change in your vision? no no nothing like that okay and just to go back to your you're saying you had low mood some people who are who do have low mood uh and low sex drive can sometimes feel uh suicidal as well have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else no no no not really no and are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities that you have done in the past Sometimes, I mean, I guess most of the activities, but when I've been doing sports as well, I find sometimes it's quite difficult to breathe. So I have some kind of shortness of breath when doing sports compared to maybe a couple of months ago. Okay, so you've become more short of breath over the last few months. Yeah. and you've had, okay, so any other things around this, more fatigue, more shortness of breath over the last few months, with a lower mood, decreased sex drive. Is there, just before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like to talk about? No, nothing specific, no. So, getting a little bit towards the end now, but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you. I would like to probably see you in person and do an examination, and also we'd probably like to do some blood tests as well. So, do you think it'd be possible to see, to book an appointment in the next few days with your GP, or that would be ideal I think here and then we can probably do some more do an examination and do some investigations really to see what's going on here a little bit more. That makes sense, yeah. Is that alright? Yeah it's very useful thank you. It's better to have some kind of plan. Yeah yeah yeah I think I definitely think we need a plan here it's been nice talking to you I'm sorry we run out of time now but we've at started the ball rolling with some further investigations and tests I'm glad you know you're you're although you have a low mood and you're not feeling suicidal just to confirm that and you're and we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some of your tiredness and your other symptoms and we'll see you okay thank you very much for taking the time okay thank you
