And generally, if you have things like a chest infection, you would have a bit like a wheeze or shortness of breath. So things that we would recommend is you can use the night nurse, day nurse. It's still okay with your medications. yeah so i'm sure you were a bit wary to use them but it's still okay with your current medication you can still use that might be able to make you feel a bit more better quickly if there's any change like you're feeling short of breath or the your symptoms are lasting more than three weeks or something or you're becoming poorly uh things like that then you need to get in touch with us then probably we might need to examine you and especially your chest but i don't think so that's necessary at this point in time. Okay that sounds good. Okay any questions at all? No I think that's been very helpful thank you. Okay so just to round it up just use the night nurse, day nurse, if any change in your symptoms like shortness of breath, wheezy or symptoms are lasting more than three weeks then get in touch with us. Okay so I don't need any prescription or anything? No, you don't need anything at the moment okay take care then thank you very much
