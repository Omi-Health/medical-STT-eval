I can't seem to be able to keep anything in me, not even water, not even my tea, not even any liquid stuff. I've just been throwing up everything. Okay. And when were you last sick? I was sick just after trying to have breakfast this morning, so maybe about two hours ago. Okay. And have you been passing water okay? Yeah, I've been urinating, okay. Is that what you mean? Yeah, urinating, yeah. What sort of colour is the urine? To be honest, I've actually not had a look, so I really couldn't say.

How's your bowels normally? Sorry I didn't catch How's your bowels normally? My bowels are normally fine. I would normally go to the toilet every day. Any episodes of diarrhoea or constipation normally? No. And is there anything you think might have triggered this off? Have you been abroad anywhere? No, but then my brother has actually been having similar symptoms for the past few days as well. and he does say like everyone in school has got it so I don't know that might be from him. So you've been in contact with him have you? Yes. Okay and any other medical problems? None that I'm not aware of. Have you had any other symptoms at the moment like rash? No no rash no nothing. Okay any surgery before or abdominal problems or any other medical issues? Well apart from the fact that this one is giving me abdominal pains, no previous abdominal pains before. Obviously I get the odd menstrual cramps and all that but you know that's you know that comes and goes. Okay and whereabouts is the pain that you're getting? It's kind of like towards my navel area like I can't touch my navel area it's just so sore and it gets yeah so it's like the center of my nerve um and does the pain come and go yes it does come when it comes i feel the strong urge to go to the to the loo and then sort of releases me and sort of like comes again it comes okay um and do you take any medication regularly Well I take my vitamins, I call it vitamin D. Every day, that's about all that I regularly take. And have you got a normal diet? Yeah, I eat well normally. Right. Do you smoke or drink alcohol? Well I don smoke I have a pint from time to time And do you take any other drugs No like I said I only take vitamins For my menstrual calms when it comes maybe I might take an ibuprofen just to eat the pain And when was your last period? Two weeks ago. Okay, are you on any contraception? No. Are you having regular sexual intercourse? No. Okay. And what's your job? I'm a graphics designer. Have you had to miss work because of this problem? Well, yes, I've had to actually work from home today. I'm working from home today because I can't be out for work. Okay. And who do you live with at home? I live with my brother and my mum. Okay. And have you tried anything yourself for this problem? Well, I've tried a home remedy. I've tried the ORS thing I bought from my local... Can you just repeat that? The ORS, the salt sugar ORS mix. The salt sugar mix. Okay, and how often have you been taking that? I've taken that like three times a day for the past two days. Okay. And do you feel like your symptoms are easing off or getting worse? To be honest, I'm not getting any better because like I said, I've been vomiting literally everything I take. So I doubt that even that has had the chance to work. Okay. I mean it sounds like because your brother's had a similar thing it sounds like it might be some an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got which is usually caused by a virus but it can be from something you've eaten as well if the symptoms they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts. If the symptoms are continuing to get worse the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough. Sometimes you do require certain medication to help this if it sometimes if it caused by bacteria What I would say probably worth as it been going on for a few days and you feel like it not sun to ease off I think it probably important to get a sample of the stool so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection that needs specific treatment. Okay. And we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated because if you're not keeping fluid down then you can get dehydrated. How do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even like drink water I'm throwing up everything? Yeah so you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts it's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago so you're obviously still hydrated enough to pass urine but we should see you so that we can check your hydration and get that sample sent off as soon as possible because if you come into the clinic you can send that sample off straight away otherwise we would have to post it out to you which would time. Okay so when can I come to the clinic to have this? So we can we can make you an urgent appointment and then you can you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration and but if in the meantime you're feeling more unwell then we would get you seen urgently in A&E. Okay so you could call us back in the meantime okay so while yeah if you could please book me the appointment and then yeah i'll see how i feel um before the end of the day hopefully i don't need to go to any keep drinking keep going with the rehydration salts just tiny sips constantly to so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and you vomit so just tiny tiny sips but just keep going with it um and just have very simple food if you're going to have anything like toast or biscuit or something really light like that avoid um fruit vegetables and milk anything like that which might just make it worse okay okay so you're happy to book an appointment through the support line yes please right okay we'll do that for you fine okay take care thank you thanks bye
