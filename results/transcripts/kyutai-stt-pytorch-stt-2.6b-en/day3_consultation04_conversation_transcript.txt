Hi, hello, I'm Dr. Jacob, welcome to Babylon. Hello. Hi. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please? And your date of birth? 14th of December, 1996. And your address for me, please. And 28 Quicks Road, SW 191EZ. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location, we can have a confinancial conversation. Thank you. Okay, so you mentioned in our notes that you've got some tiredness. If you could like to tell me a bit more about it, please? Yeah, so about two to three days ago, I was running with a friend, and usually I could talk to her whilst I ran, but I found myself actually short of breath. I'm not really short of breath when I'm walking, but definitely if I'm walking briskly now. And I've used my blue inhaler, but no avail, it hasn't really helped me. But yeah, so I'm having, I'm just wheezing a bit and coughing and just generally a bit short of breath. Wheezing and coughing, okay. And you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler, so how often are you using the blue inhaler? I think I'm just using that as and when I have symptoms. Yeah, so at the moment you are having shortness of breath, so are you using it every day at the moment? Yeah, and morning and evening to kind of prevent it as well. Okay, and which colour, what's the name of your preventer? It's blue, I think in totality my history of salbutamol, clenil, cetraban, and hydroxyzone, that I'm taking as well. Okay, so could you repeat that, your salbutamol, clenil, Cetraban, and hydroxyzone. And hydroxyzone, so you have eczema also, yeah? What's that, sorry? You do have a history of eczema. My brother's asthmatic and my sister has eczema, and I've got a few issues that I think could be eczema as well. Okay, right. So coming back to your shortness of breath, you've mentioned you're wheezy and you're coughing. Are you bringing up any phlegm at all? No, I don't, I'm not coughing up much phlegm. Okay, no phlegm, okay. Right, Theo. And how are you using your clenil? So are you using it every day? I think I'm using that every day and the phlegm beautiful just like as and when. So how are you using the clenil? Is it twice a day? Yes, twice a day. Okay, and have you ever been admitted in hospital because your clenil was so bad? No, I haven't. Okay, right here. When was the last time you had an asthma attack? About three to four years ago. Three to four years ago. And what did the DP do at that time? Just encourage me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative. Okay, so you didn't have any steroids or antibiotics? Not that I can remember. Okay. Okay, right. Have you ever had oral steroids in the past? No. When was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse? About two years ago. Okay, two years ago. Okay, but your asthma was pretty under control till now, isn't it? Yes, just in the last two to three years. So do you do a peak flow meter at home? Peak flow reading, where you blow into, you know, do you do that? No? Just every now and then. I haven't done it over the last, since I've had symptoms. Okay, so what was your peak flow reading when you're good? Like normal peak flow reading? I think 20, 20 or 30. Okay, let's say it's about 380. Yeah, yeah. Okay, right. So that's your normal, yeah? Right, yeah. Okay, so what we need Okay, do you have any allergies at all? I have a fever. Sorry, could you repeat that, please? Sorry, I have hay fever. Okay, okay, no, no, any allergies to medication? Oh, no, sorry. Okay, so you're not allergic to anything? Okay, so no allergies, okay, excellent, right here. So what we need to do that, obviously, you haven't had asthma check for some time and it looks like you're currently having a small exacerbation. So what I would like you to be seen by one of our GPs in the next few days. In the interim, what I'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when, okay? And use it maximum about every two to four hours, but if you're using it that often, that means pretty much that your asthma's really bad. You can use it, but that's not ideal. The browning, your clemel, the brown inhaler, you can up the dose if you're using just two puffs twice a day, you can increase it to four puffs twice a day, yeah? And while this is to do while you're waiting to see us. Now, as I mentioned, you know, you're doing what, you know, increase the clemel to four puffs twice a day, and you're using the asthma, you know, the blue inhalers every two to four hours, and your breathing's getting really worse, then you would need to take yourself to AME. You shouldn't wait for our appointment, okay? So when your doctor sees you, what we're going to do is we're going to examine your chest, yeah? Make you do the beat that you're reading. So depending on what we find, you might need some antibiotics or some steroids. But anyway, while you're at home, we are going to, by increasing your clenal, we are increasing your steroid intake anyway. Okay. So, yeah, so any questions you wanted to ask me? Am I about to do anything? Yeah, so book an appointment, call support, book an appointment to see, and I will recommend that you do the face-to-face. In the interim, increase your browning, halo, poo, four puffs twice a day, and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly, but if your breathing's getting worse and you've not seen them, you take your puff to AME. All right? Okay, thank you so much for your time. You're welcome, and take care then. Bye-bye. Bye.
