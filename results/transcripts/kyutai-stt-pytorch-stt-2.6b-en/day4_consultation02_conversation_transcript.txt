Yes Okay, and do you drink or smoke? Yes How much do you drink? Once a week, a couple of glasses of wine And how about smoking? No And I need to ask this to all of my patients, but do you do anything else recreational in terms of drugs? No Okay, so you've never taken cocaine or marijuana? No Okay, thank you. And are you allergic to anything? No Good. So you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment, and I can understand they probably feel quite strange and unusual. Yeah. I think the best course of action is you come and see one of our doctors in the clinic. Yeah. We can give you an examination. And what that means is we check your heart and your breathing. Yeah. Make sure that those things are functioning correctly. Yeah. And probably do some blood tests for your thyroxine. Yeah. And take it from there. How does that sound? That sounds very good. Thank you. I think before we give you any medications, we should see you in person. Okay. So what I'm going to do is book an appointment, or I think you can book an appointment through the app to come and see you in the clinic. Yeah. See one of my colleagues. Yeah. I'll let them know what you've told me today, so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said. Thank you. Great. Right. Do you have any questions? No, that was it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Yeah, bye.
