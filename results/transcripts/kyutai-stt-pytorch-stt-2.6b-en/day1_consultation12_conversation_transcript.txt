Okay, all right. Fine, so Robert, I think having listened to your story, I think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis. Okay. Which essentially is just a tummy bug, it's an infection of your tummy, and normally lasts for about three to five days and gets better. All right. There's things you can do to really help yourself get better soon, or you can drink plenty of fluids, really try and flush the toxins out of your body. Okay. You can get things from the pharmacy, which are called Diralyte, which can help replenish any minerals and vitamins you may have lost. Sorry, what's the name of that? It's called Diralyte. It's a type of fluid replacement drink. You can take some paracetamol if you're feeling feverish and weak. I would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for next day or two until you get better. Okay. Normally, you have to be diarrhea free for about 24 to 48 hours before you return back to work. Let's see how the next few days go, and if you're still not better next week, I want you to come back and see me, and we can have another look at your symptoms, okay? That sounds good, that sounds good. Thanks so much. Do you have any questions for me? No, I think that's fine. Yeah, I'll try to write and drink plenty of fluid and I hope it goes away. If it doesn't, I'll call back, is that okay? I really hope you get better soon. Thanks a lot, thanks so much for your time. Bye-bye. Okay, bye.
