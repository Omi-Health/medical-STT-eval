Hello? Hello? Hi, hi. Hi, can you hear me? I can hear you well. Hi, my name is Dr. Gil. I'm one of the doctors that works at Babylon. Can I check your name and date of birth, please? Yes, my name is Roberto Mendoza. Okay. I was born on the 1st of January of 1992. Okay, and are you in a space that's quiet and you're able to talk? Oh, sorry, I am of 1990, sorry, I'm 48, sorry, I forgot the third part. So you're 48, and are you able to talk at the moment? Yeah, yeah. Okay, tell me, it says here you have a, you're having problems going to the toilet? Yes, so I have a, I don't know how do you say it properly in English, I mean, like diarrhea. Okay. Yeah, so it's lasting for like three days, and yeah, I don't know, I don't know what would cause it. I have a bit of pain, nominal pain, and I had a bit of vomiting. Yeah, but these are kind of like what is happening to me. Okay, tell me how you were three days ago, before this started. Did you have any medical problems? So I have, I have, I have asthma, and I take some, some inhaler, Okay. I don't know, I take an inhaler, and I have an allergy, I have an NKDA allergy. Okay. I don't know if it's because, I don't know, because it inhales your, yeah. And apart from asthma, do you have anything else? I don't know, maybe it's because, you know, it's this thing here in the stomach, stuff, I always have in the back of my head are my father, because he died about 10 years ago of all cancer. Okay. So, yeah, this is kind of my worries, I don't know. Okay, so you've had the diarrhoea for three days, and now you're having pain and vomiting? Yes, yes. Has the diarrhoea been getting better or worse? I think it's not getting better or worse, it's kind of like, like, either, like normal. Okay. Like, it hasn't gone away, it hasn't worsened. Okay, and how often do you go to the toilet? I go, I need to go, I can't go to work because I need to go like every, I don't know, it's this feeling, like I go to the toilet and then when I finish, I need to, I feel I need to go again. Okay. And, and yes, I need to be like close to the toilet. That must be, that must be hard. Yeah, yeah. You have to drink more water than normal. Ah, I don't know, maybe I'm not drinking enough water. Yeah, I drink, I think I, yeah, I don't know, I think I don't drink enough water. An important question, have you noticed any blood? No, I haven't noticed any, any blood. And you mentioned tummy pain, can you tell me more about your tummy pain, like where it is, and if it goes anywhere? So, the pain is mainly focused in the center area of the abdomen, like under the belly, under the belly bottom. Yeah. Yeah, and sometimes I can hear my stomach, like the cramps. Yeah. You've been able to eat and drink? Yes, but I go to the toilet so often, so I, yeah, I try not to eat a lot because I, yeah, I just go into the toilet every 10 minutes. And you said that the tummy pain's in the middle of your tummy, does it go anywhere else? No, no, just there, and it seems to be alleviated a bit, toilet, and maybe it's like gas, I don't know what it is, but. Okay, and when was the last time you vomited? I think it was this morning, this morning, but the thing is like, because I'm not eating anything now, so I haven't vomited again. Did you have any breakfast? I didn't, no, sorry, yes, I did, actually, I did, hold on, I have some coat, I have some coat. Okay, and that, and you vomited that afterwards? And afterwards, I didn't have anything, then I got a bit of nausea, and I vomited, and then, yeah, that was it, and that was it, and I haven't eaten since then, so now I'm, I think I'm okay, but yeah, and I got, yeah. Did you notice any blood when you vomited? I think I do, I think I do, but it's, no, no, actually I can't say, sorry, I'm sorry, I don't think there is blood, because, yeah, it was strawberries that I was having for breakfast, so, yeah, it wasn't blood. Okay, and before you go, did you eat anything that you think might have been bad, or anything that could have caused the tummy pain? I don't know, to be honest, sometimes I have, when I get a bit of anxiety, I use my inhaler, Yeah. But my inhaler kind of ran out the one, because you know I'm a foreigner, so I have this brand, but I bought a new one here. Okay. And I don't know, maybe this new one has caused it. Okay. It's problem, I don't know. Okay, it's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this. Normally it's when you eat bad food or food that has gone off. And you normally get symptoms like you have suggested, but just to double check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing? I always have problems with my breathing because of the asthma. I need to use my inhaler a little bit, but apart from the normal, I haven't. Okay, and how about chest? Have you noticed any chest pain? No, I haven't noticed any chest pain. Okay, and how about walking and talking? Are those all both okay? Walking and talking, yes, yes, but yeah, I don't walk very far because I need to go to the toilet now and then, so I'm spending some time at home. And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain? Oh, it does a little bit. Okay. Sorry, I was just writing some things down. Sure. So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain. Okay. And it's normally called gastroenteritis, so an infection over the tummy. Okay. Normally, when patients have this, they do some things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids, because you're losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers, so if you start getting a temperature, then you need to drink more fetal milk. And number three is stay home for the time being, until you get slightly better. Okay. And normally, normally things like antibiotics don't help, they make the situation worse. Okay. So that's- Yeah. Go ahead. No, I was saying I didn't have any fever recently. I was sweating a little bit last four days, but I'm not sure if I had a little fever, but very little, but I don't think so, I don't think, I don't know. Maybe. So I think that's what we should do for the time being. If you feel you're getting much worse, then I would suggest you go and see your GP in real life, in person, so they can look at your belly. Okay, I will, yeah, I will book them. I will wait a couple of days to see you, or one more day, and then I will book. Great. Yeah. Cool. Do you have any more questions for me? No, that's it. I was maybe just concerned about my father's medical history, if that would Yes. some kind of risk. So the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy, and less likely to be something your father had, but if your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look at from the GP. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah, that sounds good, that sounds good. Thank you. Thank you very much, doctor, for your time. Bye bye. Bye bye.
