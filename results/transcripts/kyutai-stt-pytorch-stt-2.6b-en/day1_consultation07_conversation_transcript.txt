Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me okay? Yes, yeah, I can. Great. Right, how can I help you this afternoon, sir? I am not feeling very well. I'm sorry. And I haven't been feeling well for a good few days now. And I'm really hoping you can do something about it because it's been bugging me for a while now. Well, I was saying you might have asked for you. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on? I just feel a bit run down. You know, I've got a cough, a cold, you know, my wife's been nagging me. I just, it's just all, yeah, it's just, that's it. Well, let's start with your cough first. Tell me a bit more about your cough. Is it, for example, are you coughing up anything at all? Or is it mainly dry? Yeah, yeah, I mean, mostly dry. You know, it's a wee bit. In the morning, it's a bit worse. But, I mean, you know, it's fairly, fairly dry. So you're not bringing up any mucky, phlegm? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't like to admit that. It's, you know, it's not a talk about the, yeah, it's, it's a wee bit, wee bit, okay, yeah. Yeah, I can certainly hear you've got the sniffles, because you're a bit of a runny nose, you mentioned. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. Is that coming through loud and clear on the phone? Yeah, the sniffling. Sorry to hear that, yeah, no, it's like a different problem. And I know the symptoms are so, for example, have you had any sore throats, any ear pain? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've had a bit of a sore throat. I mean, you know, I'm doing a lot of, you know, watching the football as well, so I do a lot of shouting at that, but I'm not sure if that's related or not. Yeah, okay, who do you support? Well, it's a team called Partick Thistle, and they're in the, they're not even in the top division of the Scottish League, they're actually in the championship, which is the league below that, and they're bottom of the table. So I've been shouting myself a wee bit hoarse, because the performance has been pretty shite, if I'm being honest with you. Well, sounds fascinating, well, I wish them all the best. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you mentioned a sore throat, have you had a chance to look in the mirror, have you had a look at the back of your throat? I mean, I shave every day, so I'm looking at myself. It's not a pretty sight, to be honest, at the best of times, but it's been a wee bit rough the last few days, for sure. Yeah, I mean, have you noticed any kind of white spots in the back of your throat, or redness? Oh, right, sorry, you mean looking, no, I don't really like to look at it, so I haven't tried to do any of that. I understand, it's not pretty, it's not something we always recommend, but moving on, in terms of your ears, any dullness or blocked ears, pain in your ears? Yeah, a wee bit, I mean, you know, I'm 50 years old now, my hearing's, you know, it's not as good as it used to be, but, you know, I think it's all right, it's all right. Okay, okay, fine. Moving down to your chest, how's your breathing been? So do you feel more breathless or tight in your chest? No, no, it's not. So you're breathing in? No, no, no, no, sorry, what was that? Your breathing is fine, is it? It's not labored or? No, it's not, it's not good, it's not good. It's not good? No, no, no. Okay, okay, so you're feeling more short of breath? Yeah. Okay, okay, any pain in your chest at all? No, no, it's weird, it's just, you know, it's just a wee bit short and it's a breath, but it's not, it's not pain, you know, as such. Okay, have you noticed yourself any temperatures or fevers, feeling hot and cold, sweaty? Yeah, yeah, that's definitely something I've noticed, like, you know, in bed with a wife, I'm having to, you know, get out and get the blanket off, put it back on again, it's not, it's not pleasant, I mean, I'm keeping her up at night as well, which is a bloody nightmare, but I mean, you know how these things are. Seems very difficult at the moment. Have you measured your temperature at all? Have you got a- No, I mean, no, I mean, you know, I can, I just feel it on my forehead, but I haven't, you know, used a thermometer or anything. Cool, okay. And just moving on, just very quickly, any other symptoms, any nausea, any vomiting, any tummy pain? The first day I had, you know, a wee bit of, you know, the rot, like a wee bit of diarrhea, you know, but that's fine now. And yeah, but apart from that, no. Okay, and how's your appetite? Are you eating, drinking okay? Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to, and I think what is it you starve, are cold, and you feed the, I can't remember what it is, but I think my appetite's been all right, yeah. I'm trying to keep my fluids up as well, you know, here, that's what you should do. Yeah, absolutely, completely recommend that, keep doing what you're doing. And just lastly, any kind of muscle pain, joint pains? Yeah, it's just been a week, I mean, again, you know, I'm getting just a wee bit older now, so it's not something that I was thinking about, but I have noticed like, you know, when I'm bending down and, you know, moving about, it's just a wee bit stiffer than normal, you know, and I think that might be to do with whatever this thing is, but again, it's, you know, I'm just getting older. Where do you feel the stiffness? It's just kind of like, you know, when you're bending like elbows and knees and just a wee bit kind of stiff, you know. All over, okay. And just remind me, when did your symptoms all start? You say a few days ago. Yeah, I would say, what day is it today? It's Wednesday. Wednesday, so it would have been, what was it, Saturday, because I was out. Okay. I was out having dinner, and then, yeah, I came, yeah, yeah, yeah, it would have been that, because I was out for my wife's, she was doing this wee thing, we had a wee bit of celebration, so we were out for that. And I remember saying to her, I was like, you know what, I'm not feeling great, you know, I stuck it out with her, but it would have been that Saturday, so what's that, about five? Four, five days ago? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Were you aware of anything that might have set your symptoms off? Is it something you've eaten, or have you been traveling recently abroad, or? No, I haven't been, I haven't been traveling, I mean, as I said, I was out with my wife, I don't know whether it's like, you know, the restaurant we went to was like, it was like, pretty good, so I wouldn't have expected them to be serving me anything dodgy or anything like that, but I don't know, you know. Okay. So, nothing that I can see. And without prying too much, what were you celebrating? Well, my wife has just been promoted, so she's now going to be a head teacher of primary school, so just to correct, yeah, we night in the tiles for that, so it's good. Yeah, yeah. Well, good, excellent. So just moving on, sir, regarding what we say past medical history, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? Is there anything to do with your heart, your lungs? I'm a wee bit on the chunky side, you know, I've got a wee bit around the midriff, the spare tires, definitely there, and I've got the diabetes. Diabetes, right, and what type of diet? Is it type one or type two? It's type two, type one, all right, all right, because you said the doctor I spoke to was sort of saying like, you know, as a bigger guy, it's kind of, it's kind of like, yeah. Yeah, okay. And when I was speaking to, it was this, it was another doctor I spoke to a while ago, but when he took the, when he was telling me this as well, he took my blood pressure and that, he said that was, that was high, higher than it should be. You can diagnose it high blood pressure or just one. Okay, all right. So moving on, in terms of your medications, which medications do you take on a regular basis? Give me, I'm just going to check, it's, it's, let me know if I'm smming this correctly, because I haven't got, I haven't got my glasses with me, so it's met, That's correct, okay. And there's another one, less, less than operal. Less than operal, yeah. I think that's those two. I've got them written down a wee bit of paper, so. No problem, no problem. That's fine. Anything else, sir? No, no, just, just, just those two. Yeah, I mean, a wee bit, like, ask, you know, a wee bit of aspirin or whatever, every now and again, but, you know, nothing, nothing long term. Okay, all right. I'm just moving on swiftly, sir. Do you have any allergies at all? Not that I'm, not that I'm aware of, you know, I mean, what, what, what the allergies you get, just. Just allergies, really, I'm asking, as opposed to other things. Right, no, nothing, nothing, nothing that I'm aware of. Doctors never said nothing. Okay. And just very briefly, socially, sir, just wondering, it's very important to ask, you said you live with your wife, anyone else at home with you? No, no, kids, the kids have, they've flown the nest. So just, just me and the missus. Okay, okay. Good luck. Yeah, and are you awake at the moment? Yourself? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you do? Well, it's one of the, it's a wee factory just down the road. So we just, you know, we just manufacture like, kind of steel parts, things like that, you know. So it's a good wee job, you know, keeps us the roof over the, over us. Pays the bills, really. Yeah, exactly. What about smoking and alcohol, sir? Do you, do either? I, I do, I do like a wee drink. I, the doc, the old doctor I had, he, he, he did say I was drinking just a wee bit too much. I mean, I'm not like, you know, I'm not, I'm not an alcoholic or anything, but just, just, yeah, do like a few, a few pints every now and again. Roughly on average, how many you drink a week? Er, pints. Well, whatever you drink, is it pine, beer, lager, wine, spirits? Yeah, beer, you know, maybe, maybe a bottle of four, four pints on like Saturday and then, you know, Sunday as well, maybe like nine, nine pints in a week, I would say. Okay, okay. And what about smoking, sir? Er, we, every now and again, but I'm trying to cut that down. I've got a wee, what are those wee things called? The wee vaporisers. Okay, okay. Yeah, I've got, I got myself one of those. So I've been, I've been cutting down on the cigarettes and I just got this wee, this wee thing. It's great. It's actually like amazing, by the way. I wish you all the best in your journey to quit. I would, I highly recommend it. If you can, it was any help your health as well. So just to summarize, I think, you know, based on your story, I've got a worry. I think, you know, what you essentially have is a bit of a, a bit of a viral illness, perhaps a bit of maybe early signs of a flu, which I think should settle down really on his own over time. Things to, you know, you can do to help yourself, you know, you stay rested, drink plenty of fluids. If you are, if you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular paracetamol would be beneficial. You mentioned feeling a bit short of breath. I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but what we could think about is giving you a, a script for antibiotics, which you can maybe use in the next 24 to 48 hours, if your symptoms don't get better. All right. So, so if I'm, I just, I just lie down and take it easy. Yeah. If I'm still a bit rubbish, then. Yeah. Yeah, I'll, I'll give you a script today. Give it about 24 to 48 hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and run down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like amoxicillin, one tablet three times a day. And if you're still not better by next week, come back and see me and we can have another look. All right. Okay. Okay. So I just, plenty of rest, lots of water. Exactly. Hopefully that can pass. Yes, absolutely. All right. That is, that's perfect. That's just what I wanted to hear. Great. Well, I'm glad I could help. And I wish you and your football team all the best. I hope so. I hope so. It's not, not looking too good, but all right. Thank you. Cheers. All the best. Bye bye.
