Oh, hello. Hi, how are you doing? My name is Joe. I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? Yeah, Daniel. Hi, Daniel. And your date of birth? Yeah, 1992. 92. Okay, Daniel. And are you in a comfortable and confidential place at all? Yeah, totally. Happy to go ahead. Great. How can I help? Yeah, I just, my chest has been feeling really tight. Okay. And how long has this been going for, Daniel? For about three hours now. Okay. And so tight chest, three hours. And so you're born in 92, so it makes you 26. 26, yeah. And you are, any shortness of breath at all with that? Yeah, like a little bit. Yeah, a little bit short of breath. Not too bad. Any cough, wheeze? Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well. There's coffee, coffee, yeah. Slight cough, yeah. Yeah. Sore throat, runny nose, sore ears. You know, I had a cold last week and it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose, I was just feeling under the weather. You're feeling better now other than the tight chest? I mean, I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore. Right, okay, okay. But now you've got this, so you've still got symptoms of a cold, essentially. Yeah, the cough's kind of stuck around. Yeah, okay. Are you coughing up anything? No. And do you have any other medical problems, like asthma? Yeah, yeah, I have asthma. I've had it for a while now. And then I have like a hay fever, you know, some allergies to dust. Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any medications? Yeah, so, you know, the Ventolin, it's called salbutamol. Yeah. I got that one. And then I have a steroid, Klenel, Klenel inhaler. Klenel modulate, yeah, okay. Yeah. And have you been using Klenel and the Ventolin? And how often have you been using them? Well, to be honest, I was away at uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me. So I haven't really in the past week. Both of you? Because, sorry, they ran out and I forgot to go and grab the next one. Yeah, sure. About a week ago. Okay, all right, all right. So you haven't got any Klenel or any Ventolin at the moment? Not with me right now, no, I ran out. Okay, all right. And any drug allergies, you know? No, no, not allergic to anything. Just like, just the dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs. Okay, great. Now, do you, anyone in your family have any medical problems? Yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Oh, when I was young, I also had eczema and I had a milk protein allergy when I was young too. Okay. Right, so just, do you have any sort of cnybody or ideas about what my people going on? Not really, like I feel like asthma is probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers wouldn't be helpful. It's just kind of scary because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight in a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I can imagine. Well, it certainly sounds like you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough, and it's nonproductive cough, and you're short of breath. Is the cough worse at nighttime? I mean, it gets a little bit worse at night, but basically just pretty consistent. It hasn't gone away. Okay. And you've got this tight, tight chest. But you can tell you've got chest pain, just more of a tight chest, is that? No, not really pain. It's more like tight. It just feels like sometimes I can't get a full breath in, you know? Yeah, sure. Okay, well, I would quite like to certainly get you some Ventolin, Clinical Modulate. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit more, like back in high school. But I've been pretty good at taking my inhalers, so not so much anymore. Have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient, as in, you know, stayed in there overnight for asthma? Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat. Oh, okay. So you went to hospital and had a, so you stayed in hospital for a few days, did you with an asthma exacerbation? Yeah, I did, yeah. Okay, but currently you're just on Ventolin and Clinol, and you haven't got any of those inhalers at the moment? Yeah, I'd be pretty good, I'd be pretty good just on the Clinol and the salbutamol. When, sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation? I think I was like 17, 16 maybe. Okay, just to quantify how short of breath you are, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you, no, you won't have, will you? Are you able to like walk up flight of stairs okay, walk on the flat okay, without getting too short of breath, or are you short of breath at rest? I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like except for that feeling I was describing. It does when I'm walking upstairs, I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be. Sure. Yeah, okay, but you're not short of breath at rest at the moment. No, no, no, I'm not. Okay, fine. So what I mean, and just to go over, is there anything you'd hoped about getting other than the prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else you'd hoped about getting from this? Well, I just want to know that I'm okay to just like keep, I just don't want to have to get that intubation again. Sure, yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Well, I'm really glad you've talked to me today. I think what we can do is give you a prescription for some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within the hour, I would hope. And I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So these are tablets which you can take for five days, two tablets in the morning, and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response, okay? Okay. Now there are some side effects to the steroids, which I should really tell you about, but please read the label that's associated with it. Don't be too worried about the side effects. There aren't, most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated, and you probably, have you had them in the past, do you know? Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Have you had steroids in the past? I can't remember, probably. Probably, yeah, I regularly do, yeah. So they can come, they can make you, your mood change, can be slightly low or slightly high, can give you a high blood sugar, and that, okay, they can also cause rash, nausea, headaches, but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help you out an awful lot. What I'd like to do is send you these, some prescriptions for your inhalers are ongoing, so you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can use the clinomodulate in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN, so a Ventolin when you need to, when you're getting nausea. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than every three hours at any time, it's a good idea to seek medical attention, so see a doctor in some capacity. And the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Have you, do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before? Yeah, yeah, somebody taught me how to use one a while ago. I don't really use it, to be honest, but. Have you got one? I think I do, I have one somewhere. Okay, all right, well, I'll send you another one, and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially, a couple of puffs to prime it inside, breathing in and out for five or 10 breaths. Okay. Yeah, so, was there anything else that was on your mind, or you're concerned about at this stage? I think you got me covered. Okay, and I might give you some time off work as well, you can self-certify for seven days, but I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're okay with that. All right. All righty, well, thank you very much. No worries, any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath, or just generally concerning symptoms, pain in your chest, tightness, feeling light-headed, then seek further medical attention anytime, please. Okay. All right, sounds good. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you, bye-bye. Bye-bye.
