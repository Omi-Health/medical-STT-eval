Hello. Hi there, good morning. Hi. I'm Dr Dean Mabel from VPRH, nice to see you. Nice to see you, hello. Hi. So before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth if that's okay? Yes, Mary Richards, and I'm 40 years old, so Okay fine, so you're 40 years old you said yeah? Perfect okay. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yeah. Okay great. So how can I help you today? So I've just been having some problems with my hearing. I can't really hear very well and I noticed that my face has been feeling a bit numb recently. Right, okay. And how long has this been going on for? It's been a few weeks now, about three weeks or something. Right, okay. And is this just on one side or both sides? Just one side, just on my left side. I've noticed that the hearing's kind of gone down a bit. Right, okay. And your face feeling numb, where exactly is that? Which part of your face? Can you show me with your finger? Yeah, so again, it's the left side. It's kind of like around my left ear and kind of along here, so like my jawline is just all feeling a bit numb around here. Right, okay. Has anything else happened in this time? Any other symptoms you've had at all? Not that I've noticed. I think occasionally there's some ringing in my ear. Some ringing in your ear, okay. You know, part of it or not. Sure, okay. And have you had any weakness or numbness in the rest of the body at all? No, no, no, nothing like that. Okay. Have you had any difficulties swallowing? No. And have you had any difficulty speaking? No. Have you noticed any problems with your vision at all? No, that's all good. Okay. And do you have the numbness present right now? Yeah, it's kind of there quite often, so it's all the time. So, yeah, right now it feels very... It doesn't feel like when I touch the side of my face. Sure, sure, okay. All right. Just going back to the kind of muffled hearing feeling in the ear, do you have any discharge coming from that ear at all? No, nothing. Nothing coming out. Any pain in the ear or from the ear? No. Right, okay. And have you had any fever at all? No, nothing like that. And do you have any itchiness in the ear? No. Do you use cocking or buds to kind of clean your ears out? I don't know. No, no, no. Don't use a lot of blood. Okay. All right. Do you need to ask a few other general questions? Do you have any other illnesses at all? I've kind of been told I had polyps in my nose in the past. occasionally get some kind of half-earnies feeling um that's all fine and you know i take a rennies if i need to and if my no polyps are playing off i've got a spray um other than that i think they said ages ago i had something called i don't quite remember but labyrinthitis something like that but again nothing - Sure, okay. So are you on any regular medication? You mentioned the spray for your nose. - Yes, I know. I only take the spray for my nose when I need it for, and sometimes take over like Rennie, but I just get that from the chemist. - Sure. And the spray for your nose, where do you get that from? Is that from a doctor? Yeah they gave me prescription ages ago. Do you remember the name of the spray at all? Unfortunately I don't, sorry. That's all right, that's good. And you're not on any other medication at all? No. No, okay. Do you have any allergies to any medication? No, just latex. Latex, okay, all right, let's continue. And in terms of your family, are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all? My brother had neurofibromatosis, I think it is. Other than that, everyone else is okay. Okay, good, that's good to hear. And in terms of your own kind of background now, are you working at the moment? Yeah, so I'm a jockey, but because of all the kind of symptoms of again especially sometimes when i get a ringing i can feel a bit busy um i've just had to do far less training so kind of beginning to yeah impacting work um a little bit now okay so you have to excuse my ignorance you mean jockey like with horses is that what you're talking about yeah all right okay fine um great um uh and uh do you live alone - I live with my partner. - Okay, right. Do you have any pets at all at home? - No, no pets. - Okay, fine, fantastic, all right. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what's been going on recently? No, just like I said, like the ringing occasionally and when I get back I can sometimes feel a bit dizzy but the main thing is really the lack of hearing and the numbness that got me, like, yeah, no idea what's going on there. Okay, fine, all right. There was one thing I think because I can panic and you can look online and get a bit frantic. I guess what I'm trying to think is, is there something particularly serious that will need to be sorted and obviously reading anything can make you really frantic. Hopefully nothing so serious I would die from it. I don't know. I just I think obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via video portal but from what you've told me this doesn't seem to be anything that you're gonna die from. However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today. Okay, I would like you to come into one of my clinics. I'd like a GP to assess you. What you're describing might be something called Bell Palsy. - Yeah. We can go into that, explaining what that is, if that's confirmed on physical examination. That's not usually a life-threatening problem. But part of the reason why I'd like you to come in is just that we can do what we call a neurological examination, just to make sure there's nothing else going on, and confirm whether that might be the diagnosis. Have a look inside the ear, see if there's any... anything to see within the ear. So in answer to your question, no, I don't think that you need to worry about that. I think, you know, preliminarily I can reassure you. However, in order to definitively reassure you, I think you need a physical examination today. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to send a message to our admin team. I'll ask them to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics within central London. Okay, and then you can ring the support team number. I'll leave that number in your notes. You can ring them after five minutes and then they'll slot you into a place that's convenient for you. Okay? That's fine. Alright, so someone will see you and hopefully we'll be able to reassure you further. But please make sure the appointment gets done today. Okay, yep, they will do. That's fine. Thank you very much. All right then. Okay, nice to see you. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye.
