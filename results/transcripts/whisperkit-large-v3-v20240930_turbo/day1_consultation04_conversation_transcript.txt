Alex oh hello how can you hear me yeah okay great how can I help you this morning sir I've been feeling I've been feeling kind of under the weather for the past four days it started with a sore throat and runny nose and it's sort of it's sort of going into a cough now the sore throat is kind of going away but I'm starting to cough mm-hmm okay so as you hear that kind of bad and tired. I'm sorry to hear that there's a lot going on there. So let's start with your sore throat first. Tell me a bit more about that if you can. So I think it all started with a colleague of mine. She just kept sneezing next to me all the time. I think her kids are catching something from there. from their kindergarten or something and you know that it started as normal sore throat and it was quite painful for a couple days but then it was fast. Okay, did you have any difficulty or pain or swallowing? Yeah, it was quite painful to swallow for one of the days. Did you manage to have a look in the back of your throat in the mirror? No, not really. No, okay. You didn't notice any abnormal white spots, redness at the back of your throat? - No, I didn't think about looking. - That's okay, that's okay. And you mentioned a runny nose. Again, what kind of discharge is coming out? Is it clear or is it a bit more colored? Yeah, it's clear but sort of getting my nose stuffed all the time, it's very hard to get it free. Okay, so you feel quite congested, G? Yeah, quite congested. Okay, fine. You also mentioned a cough as well, can you tell more about that? Yeah, that started recently, like just maybe yesterday and it's dry for now. It's not very painful but it's sort of there all the time. Okay, and is it worse at any particular time of the day? Sorry? Is it worse at any particular time of the day, for example in the evenings, night time, mornings? Or is it throughout the day? No, it's sort of constant. I forgot to mention that I'm also having night sweats. Night sweats, okay. That's very odd actually, and that sort of makes me a bit tired. It makes my sleep a bit I can imagine yes and this is again been going on for the last three four days has it? Yes. Have you noticed any fevers or temperatures at all? I had some fever in the beginning but it's now sort of going down I've been taking some paracetamol and ibuprofen and they help. That's very sensible, very good. In terms of your chest otherwise have you any difficulty breathing or any pain in your chest? So no pain in chest but I noticed that I So I feel a bit winded on exertion. I haven't been going to the gym because of that. When you say winded, do you feel more short of breath, would you say, on exertion? And that's mainly on exercise, but when you're resting, there's no problem. yeah yeah when when when I'm resting it's okay so I've been actually going to work and sort of managing. Just a couple of the questions if you don't mind any pain in your ears at all? No. You don't feel blocked or any discharge coming out of your ears? I don't think so. Okay fine. What I'm going to do, I'm going to run through a few yes/no questions if you don't mind, just a review of your systems. Any headaches at all? Yeah, yeah that's still there. Whereabouts are the headaches? Just sort of general and they're not always there but you know every now and then they would come and go. Okay and with these headaches have you any problems with your eyesight, your vision? No. Any difficulty with seeing bright lights? No, I don't think so. Okay, and just moving down now, in terms of any feeling nausea or any vomiting? None of that. Okay, tell me about your bowels, are your bowels working okay? Yeah, yeah, I think so. Passing urine okay? Yeah, yeah. How's your appetite sir? Yeah I've been drinking a little bit more than the usual but other than that. Okay and you're eating and drinking, are you eating okay otherwise? Maybe a bit less than what I would usually have. Okay, have you noticed any funny rashes at all on your skin? No. And any general muscle pain or aches, joint pain? Yeah, that's sort of started in the past couple days. Yeah, okay. And just have a look at the rest of your history, are you otherwise fit and well or do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? So otherwise I'm fine. There isn't anything that I'm taking or being treated for. Okay. So you're otherwise getting well. Any allergies at all to any medications I should be aware of? No, very much. Any family history at all? Anything relevant in the family that I should be aware of? Anything like diabetes, high blood pressure? Yeah, my grandma has diabetes. Your brother? My grandma. You say grandma, sorry my apologies. Grandma, okay. Do you know what type of diabetes it is? Is it type 1? I think it's type 2. Okay. Anything else that you think is significant? Yeah, I think one of my... great-granddad had an eczema. Excellent okay. Just moving on to what we say social history just to get to know you a bit more as a person. Tell me who do you live with at home? I live alone. Okay and you said you're working at the moment is that right? Yeah. What do you do for work? I'm an accountant. Okay, and how's your work going at the moment? Has it been affecting your work? A little bit. I've been a bit slower and you know it's a bit of a stressful period just around the end of the year. Is that stress affecting your mood at all in any way? No, I think it's the good kind of stress. It's good work. If there's anything you ever want to talk to me about, you can always come and see me about your mood, stress, anxiety. We're happy to help. No, I like my job. It's just a bit more work than usual. Okay. And just very briefly, in terms of smoking, do you smoke at all? Yeah, occasionally no cigars and things on company parties. Okay, so not regular. And what about alcohol? Occasionally I would have some. I'm not a very big drinker. Again, socially with work. Okay, so just having listened to your story, really just to summarise, you know, the last four days you've been feeling generally quite unwell, sore throat, runny nose, bit of a dry cough, bit of muscle pain, weakness, had an initial fever but now settled. I don't think there's a lot to worry about. I think you probably have a bit of a viral, what we say viral illness and maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection or maybe early signs of a flu. It normally lasts about seven to 10 days and just gets better really over time. But things you can do to really help yourself is get plenty of rest. I'll probably advise you taking a day or two of work if you can. making yourself, you know, pushing fluids and make yourself well hydrated, continuing with the regular paracetamol and ibuprofen and we should see how things go really. If next week is still a lot better, I'd like you to come back and see me. Is that clear? Does that make sense? Yeah, that's so good. It makes sense. I think I'll take a couple of days off. Yeah. And things to look out for if you're really not getting better, if you have a high fever or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored or chest pain, I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner. Give me a call and we can help you out, okay? Yeah, understood. I'll take care. Great. Have a great day. Good luck with your work. Thank you. Thank you.
