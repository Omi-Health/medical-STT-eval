Hello. Hello. Hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please? Michael Johnson. And your date of birth? 092983. Okay. And your address for me, please. 231 Leonard, London Street. Sorry, London. Okay, and that's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Yes. Okay. You've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea. I'm sorry to hear about it. So if you tell me a bit more about it, please. It's been happening for about three days now. Okay. Yeah, it started off, I don't know, it's just something that I thought would go away pretty quickly. I've had that from time to time after eating certain types of food or going on certain travels, but nothing funky in my diet, no travels recently, and it just kind of kept up. I'm a bit confused as to what to do. So you haven't had anything from outside, nothing dodgy, anything? No. No, no, no. Just a little bit. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's pretty standard diarrhea where there's like a little bit of abdominal pain. I threw up once. That was a little worrying. Repeat that please. That wasn't clear. What did you say? I threw up once. Once? After that we said something. Nothing else was worrying. Okay. Right. And with the diarrhea, how many times a day are you going to the toilet? Four to five. Four to five times, yeah. Is there any... and it's like water? Is it like water or is it just loose? What do you mean? Are you going like water or is it just, you know, a bit of solid stools, a bit loose kind of thing? It probably depends on the time of day to be honest. A bit of both. And is there any blood or mucus? No blood. What do you mean mucus? It's like the snotty stuff. In the stool? Yeah, it looks like snot. No. No, so no mucus. Okay. Any fever at all? - Maybe a little bit, but it hasn't been, that in particular hasn't been too worrying. - Are you still able to eat and drink? - A little bit of, appetite loss I guess versus the normal okay but also not something I've like if that was alone I wouldn't have reached out so but you're still able to drink quite a bit yeah you're drinking plenty yeah yeah okay mostly to try and rid okay and what have you take have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea nothing yet nothing yet okay anything for the abdominal pain nothing yet okay right and any unfortunately we don't have any of your past medical history is that anything you'd like to say I probably at asthma um or or i don't know i guess i still have it okay and uh are you any anything else other than asthma uh my dad had hypertension okay as hypertension yeah hypertension yeah he died of bowel cancer 10 years ago oh yeah okay bowel cancer 10 years ago. And how old was he when he died? 62. Okay. And you mentioned you had asthma. Are you using any inhalers at all? Yes. Which ones? Lexipro. Sorry? Lexipro. Lexipro. Yes. Okay, not heard of it. Is it like salbutamol? Is it like a blue color? Yellow. Yellow, okay. I'll have to check that one. Not sure. Like seed proof. Okay, that's fine. Any other medication that you're using? Over the counter, anything at all? No. Okay. Right. Any allergies? Nothing. Yeah, nothing. No allergies at all. Right, yeah. Fine. So, Obviously, you just have diarrhea, it's about four to five times a day. You're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated, which is a good sign. When we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day. That means probably whatever you're eating is going straight through. You still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids. Okay, when you go to the toilet. Things that one would advise is a soft diet. So avoid dairy, fish, meat, eggs, while you're having diarrhea. Sorry? What is a soft diet? What is that like outside of not those things? What do you mean by soft? Okay, so that will be like crackers, toast, jam, those kind of things that's easily digested. Like what we would give babies. Yeah, when they start eating, you give simple food for babies. You don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding. So that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about. Yeah. Once you are able to keep most of it in, you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash. Once you're okay with that for about 48 hours, then you can start having meat. So just don't have meat immediately once you feel like you're slightly better because you might go back to square one again. okay with that diet like once 48 hours you're not having any diarrhea you're fine then you can go and start having meat egg fish and so that is getting better but isn't getting or do you want it to go away completely at that point or if it's like trending up no no no preferably just don't because why do we say this is because it takes much more time for me to get digested so because your gut flora you know the the bacteria in your gut is not as it should be, it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food, while it doesn't take that much of an effort to digest mash and vegetables. Does that make sense? Yes. Yeah? So at the same time, you could have some, although you can't eat, milk is not a good idea, yogurts are a good idea because they are probiotics, it helps to build up the normal gut bacteria back. Okay? So those kind of, now things to look out for, if your diarrhea doesn't go away in a week's time or if you're passing blood, we need a stool sample. because that means you may have some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics. Okay. Okay. If you, again, as I've mentioned previously, if you're going about six to eight times a day, that means there's a high chance that you are having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time. If that happens, do get in touch with us again. All right? Okay. Any questions? You look a bit confused. No, that's it. Yeah. Okay. And also you could get something called diarylite over the counter. So it helps to replenish the salts that you've been that's lost through going to the toilet. Okay. Okay. If you're a bit confused, you know, you can actually, all this is all recorded in your app. So you can go back, I'll put that all in detail. So if, you know, I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything, you can go back and read the notes. Okay? That's great. All right, then. You take care. Bye. Bye now. Bye.
