Hello? Hello? Hello? Hi, can you hear me? I can hear you, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you now. Excellent. Just before I go any further, can you confirm your name and your age, please? Oh yeah, my name is Jessica Smith and I'm 19 years old. Okay, and how can I help you, Mrs Smith? Yeah, so I mean this is a bit embarrassing but it's kind of hurting when I use the bathroom, when I pee and it's been going on for a few days so I'm a little bit worried about it. I'm not sure what to do. Right, well thank you for coming in so hopefully we can help with your symptoms. As you mentioned it started a few days ago, so can you tell me a bit more about what kind of pain it is that you're experiencing? It's not too bad, it's sort of like a stinging kind of pain. It's not like unbearable, but it definitely bothers me when I pee. And yeah, I also maybe sometimes get some pain kind of lowered down in my tummy when I go to the bathroom. - Okay. And the pain in your tummy, can you describe the pain to me? Is it cramping, burning, sharp? Yeah, I don't know, maybe sort of cramping. I'm not really sure, but it's not like cramping when I have a period or something. It's like, I don't know. Okay, fine. Have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal? I don't think so, I haven't noticed it. No, okay, fine. Have you noticed any funny colour for your urine? So has there been any blood in your urine or have you noticed any other darkening of your urine? There was a little bit of blood earlier today, but besides that, not at all, no. It does kind of... it kind of like doesn't smell very it smells a bit weird I guess but no not really anything anything drastic okay fine okay right let me just write a few notes down as well fine and you mentioned the tummy pain that also started a few days ago does the pain move anywhere else does it move towards the back or towards your flank the sides No, not really, no. No, okay, fine. Would there symptoms, have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? No, not at all. Okay, any fevers or temperatures? Sorry, any fevers or temperatures? I didn't hear you. No, no fever. No fever, okay fine, sorry. Okay, in terms of your bowels, are your bowels making okay? I think so, yeah. Any diarrhea, loose stool? No, not that I've noticed at all. Okay, alright. And Jessica, sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions just to get a full history. Are you currently sexually active? Yeah, I am. Is that with a regular partner? Yeah, so I've had a boyfriend for about a couple months now. Fine, okay. Have you noticed any other discharge from down below? I haven't noticed anything. No, okay. When was your last STD screen? If ever. I don't think I've ever had one. Okay, fine. And do you use any form of contraception at all? Yeah we use condoms. When was your last period? A couple weeks ago. Is there any chance you could be pregnant perhaps? Say again? Is there any chance you could be pregnant? I don't think so. It's always worth asking young females like yourself. So if you are worried about the pain, not getting any better, then I would advise you doing a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. Okay. So just moving on, are you otherwise fitting well? Yeah, I think I'm feeling okay otherwise, yeah. And so by that I mean do you have any other medical problems, medical history? So in the past I've had some IBS but other than that I think no serious medical problems that seem, yeah. Okay. Do you take any regular medications? No, I did a little bit ago or a couple days ago try some over-the-counter bicarbonate to try and help with the pain but it wasn't really helping. Okay so you've tried that and didn't help, okay all right. Do you have any allergies to any medications? Yeah I'm allergic to clindamycin. And what happens when you take clindamycin? I get some swelling basically. It seems like a quite severe allergy to it, is that right? In terms of your family history, is there anything I should be aware of? Related to kidneys, bladder, bowels, gut? No, I don't think so. Not anything I know about. Okay, alright. And tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? So I live in a flat near my college with a couple of friends of mine. So I'm not living at home or anything. Okay, and what are you asking about? Sorry. Okay, and are you working at the moon or are you a student? I'm a student. Okay, what are you studying? I'm studying biology. And how's that going? It's good, yeah, it's really interesting learning about how the world works. Great. Do you have any aspirations for the future in terms of careers? I don't know, maybe a doctor someday, you never know. I recommend it, we need doctors. What about smoking and alcohol? Do you smoke or do you drink much in a way of alcohol? I don't smoke, I do drink on the weekends. So socially, okay. All right. Excellent. So at this stage I'll proceed to examination. But based on your story, just to summarise, really, the last three days you've been having a bit of burning pain or passing urine, a bit of crampy tummy pain lowered down. essentially, but no other fevers or back pain, if I understand correctly. I think we probably do have what we call a simple UTI or a urinary tract infection, bladder infection, which can be readily treated. So I'll give you a course of antibiotics today. something called either nitrofurantoin or trimethoprene and it's normally a three-day course so one tablet twice a day for three days and that should help your symptoms but I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids let's try and flush that you know that infection out of your body if you can you can try cranberry juice that can sometimes help with your symptoms and if you're still not better by the end of this week I want you to give me a call or come back and see me and we can have another look at your symptoms. - Okay, so three days of the medication and then wait a little bit, if it still doesn't go away, call back? - Yeah, absolutely. And things to look out for would be, if you are having kind of high temperatures, back pain, just generally feeling more unwell, do give me a call back, 'cause then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we wanna avoid. So do give me a call if you have any concerns, okay? Okay, is there anything like, should I be worried about not having sex or anything within the next week or anything like this? Well, I mean, if you can try and avoid it, I think that'd be sensible. It's great that you're using barrier contraception. I recommend you to continue using barrier contraception. But if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up, that would be the best for you and your boyfriend. Okay. That makes sense. Great. Okay, thank you so much. Wish you all the best. Yeah, thank you.
