Hello? Hello there. Hello, can you hear me okay? Yes, I can hear you. Okay, great. Are you the doctor? I am, yes. Dr. Seed here, Oscar. How can I help you this afternoon? I'm contacting you because I've been quite short of breath lately. Okay, do you want to tell me a bit more about it? When did it all start? Well it seems to have been slowly getting worse over the last couple of weeks. It's become quite troublesome in the last few days. Normally I can walk to the shops without a problem but now I'm having to sort of sit down and catch my breath and I'm even starting to get a bit breathless just about the house and it's got me kind of worried. I don't really know what's going on. Is there anything you're particularly worried about? Well, I've got heart failure. I was told that a while ago and I got a bit breathless when I was first diagnosed and put on some medicine sets. that helped but I'm a bit worried it's getting worse. Right okay so you mentioned you've been feeling shorter breath for the last couple of weeks but mainly the last couple of days has got a bit worse and you're now feeling more breathless or kind of minimal exertion you mentioned. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all with your breath so for example any pain in your chest? No pain in my chair. Have you found yourself coughing at all? I've got a bit of a dry cough but it's not too troublesome. Okay okay and how's your general health otherwise are you feeling weak, lethargic? I'm feeling a little run down but otherwise pretty normal. I've noticed my ankles have got bigger. Okay and what do you mean by that? It's just like they've sort of swollen up a bit. Okay is that both ankles? Yeah, both ankles. Yeah, it's a bit embarrassing. Okay, I can imagine, yeah. And again, over how long have you noticed this for? I kind of noticed it the last few days. Last few days, okay. And is this something that you've had before in the past? I think my ankles did swell up a bit last time the heart failure was a problem. Okay okay. Fine okay so just to really recap so you really the last couple of weeks you've been feeling breathless but worse in the last couple of days you mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough and some swelling in your ankles. But importantly, no chest pain. And have you noticed your heartbeat racing at all? So palpitations or skipped heartbeat? No, not really. Okay. And any temperatures or fevers? No. Okay. And how about your appetite? Are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, that's fine. Okay. And your waterworks? Are you passing urine okay? Yeah, I usually peel off. Yeah. The drugs. Sure. Okay. All right. So moving on to your past medical history, you mentioned heart failure. Any other medical history I should be aware of? Well I was told I had like a, they called it like a small heart attack about five years ago. I had like some chest pain and they took me to hospital. Okay. And they, but then I just got better. Okay. When you say small heart attack, did they give you a name for what happened? A name of a diagnosis? I can't remember they just called it something like that a small heart attack okay was it like angina or no they said they it seemed it was like more than angina okay but I didn't but I only had to stay in hospital for a few days okay and yeah I've been okay since then you've been okay since then okay all right so apart from the heart the heart problems the heart failure any other problems I should be aware of No I think I'm otherwise I'm okay. Do you take any regular medications apart from your diuretics that you're taking? Do you know which ones? Yeah I take something called Ferozomide. Do you know which dose you're taking? I can't remember I'm sorry doctor I have to check. No problems. Any other medications? Yeah, I take aspirin and Vizoprolol. Vizoprolol was it? Vizoprolol. Sorry, the connection is not very good.

Early 60s, okay. Anything else I should be aware of? My mother had osteoporosis. Okay. Is your mother still with us? Yeah, she's still living. Okay, alright.

Okay, and how is that? Is that quite stressful? Long hours? It's okay. I... yeah like when I'm working it's pretty exhausting I guess I'm a bit worried that if I get sick I won't if I get more sick then I won't be able to work properly yeah it's certainly a consideration isn't it so let's let's try and get you better soon so it doesn't have any impact on your on your job and do you find yourself doing a lot of antisocial hours that you so you do a lot of night driving weekend driving Oh no, I only take shifts during the day. I don't like working at night. Okay, alright. And what about smoking and alcohol? Because they can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems. Do you smoke at all? Not anymore. So you used to smoke? Yeah. How many did you smoke a day on average? Oh it was about a pack a day back in the day. And how many years was that for? Oh that was a good 25 years. Okay well done for stopping, it must be very difficult for you, but well done for stopping. And what about alcohol? I don't drink alcohol. Do you do much in the way of exercise, sir? I try and walk to the shops at least once a day but that's about it. I don't get running like I used to when I was young. Right, okay and certainly now with your symptoms you said you're getting more breathless even walking to the shop, she said. Right, Based on your based on your history and having listened to your story I wonder whether you've had a flare-up of your heart failure, sir We can sometimes happen And it's going on so I seem that your heart's not pumping as well as it should be and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure. There's obviously It's the first thing that comes to my mind Now there's a couple of options to move forward So given that you're otherwise well at the moment and having examined you, your chest and your saturations and blood pressure are all okay, I'm quite happy to increase your dose of furosemide. Maybe rather than one tablet a day, we can give you two tablets a day for the first few days and see how you're getting on. - Okay, if you think that would be best. - I think it's definitely worth treating your symptoms, but what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart, see how well your heart's pumping. - Okay. - Is that something you've had? - Good design. - Yeah, so an echo scan, it's a jelly scan of your heart. You may have had it done before when you were diagnosed, and it's just to get a good-- - Oh, yes, I can't remember now. - Sorry? Yeah, I remember now. Okay, fine. That's something I can organize for you today and it may take a week or two weeks for that to be organized. But I think certainly in the meantime, let's get a blood test done. We can check your full blood count, look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function and we can definitely increase your fruizamide. to you know one tablet twice a day but I really would like you to come back and see him in about weeks time to see how you're getting on does that sound reasonable? I think that sounds like a good plan and of course in the meantime if you are getting more unwell so if you're getting more breathless or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness then you know said I want you to give me a call sooner than that and we can have a chat on the phone as well okay I'll see how I get on okay do you have any questions for me that's all pretty clear thank you very much doctor great no I wish you all the best have a good day okay thank you
