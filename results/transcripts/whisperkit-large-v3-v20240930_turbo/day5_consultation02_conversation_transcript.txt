Have you had any abdominal pain or lower back pain at all? I've got pain in my tummy. Whereabouts? In my lower tummy. Okay, is it one-sided or in the middle? In the middle.

No. Okay, it sounds very much like you might have an infection in your urine. Did you say you haven't felt feverish? No fever at all. Have you got a thermometer at home? No. Okay, it would be helpful if you could get a thermometer from the pharmacy and do check your temperature just to make sure that it isn't going up and down. Okay. Normally we can treat this infection without having to test your urine with a course of antibiotics. Okay. How would you feel about that? Are you happy to take a course of antibiotics? Yes, I would be. It would just be for three days. Okay. - Do you have to get my prescription? - Yes, so I can send a prescription through to your requested pharmacy for that. If you take them as soon as you can, pick them up as soon as you can and start taking them. The other thing which is important to do is to drink lots of water, so two and a half to three liters a day. You can get some cranberry juice and drink that as well, that sometimes helps. And also some sachets which you can get from the chemists, some sachets which just help change the acidity of your urine. So I can put the details of that on your notes. Okay then. If you feel like your pain is getting worse or not settling, you get lower back pain or you're getting a high temperature or you have any problems actually passing urine, then it's very important that we speak to you again. Okay. The other thing is if it becomes a common thing or a recurrent problem, then we need to talk to you again about it. So do I have to call after I finish my course of antibiotics? No, not if you're better. Okay. If you feel like your symptoms get worse at any point or they're not resolving with the treatment or you keep getting a similar problem recurrently, then it's important for us to talk to you in more detail about that. Okay then. Have you got any other questions? No, what would be the pharmacy I'll be picking up my medication from? So have you already requested a pharmacy through Babylon? Yes, I did. Can I just check that with you? Knightsbridge practice. Okay, that's fine. So the antibiotics that I'm going to prescribe will go through to that pharmacy. and also you'll be able to pick them up from there how soon is that going to be at the practice in five minutes um i would give it longer than that give it an hour or so all right then thank you i'll pick that at lunch time okay all right then thank you take care bye bye sorry i don't keep
