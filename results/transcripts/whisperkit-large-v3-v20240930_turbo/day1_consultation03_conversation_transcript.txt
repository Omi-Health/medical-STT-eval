Hello. Hello. Hello there, it's Dr. Seed here. How can I help you this afternoon? Oh, I've just got a terrible headache since midday. On the left side, it's just making me feel so ill. I just feel like I need to vomit. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about the headache? Well, you know, I noticed some zigzag lines in my vision a few minutes before the headache started. My vision blurred. You know, it just, I, yeah, pain's just horrible. It's just making me feel so unwell. I just want you to do something. Well let's try our best, let's try and get you well soon. You mentioned this on your left hand side, is that right? And it started at midday a few hours ago? Yeah. Did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more of a gradual build up? I don't know really, it just happened. Are you able to describe what kind of headache it was? For example, was it throbbing or was it more of a sharp pain? Yeah, I guess it's throbbing on that left side. And is it moving anywhere else at all? No, but it's worse when I move. Okay. Is that when you move your neck? Well, like if I lean forward or move my head or neck, yeah, the headache gets worse. I'm just really worried, I've just been googling and I've read that if your headache gets worse when you move it could be a sign of brain cancer. Is that what you're worried about? Is that what your main worry is today? Oh yeah, yeah and I've like, you know, My friend's mum, she recently died of a brain tumour so it's really concerning me actually. Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that, I can understand why it's affecting you. But why don't we take a good history first and let me examine you and then we can have a little chat afterwards and see what's going on here. So you mentioned a few things, you mentioned headaches, you also mentioned some zigzag lines before the headaches came on. your vision has been blurry as well is that right is that on both eyes or just left left eye it feels like it's on both both eyes okay have you any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all yeah well I'm wearing wearing sunglasses right now it's just you know lights really hurting my eyes okay and you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous have you vomited at all yeah I vomited twice. Twice okay and this earlier today okay any temperatures or fevers? No I don't feel feverish. Okay any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed? No I haven't noticed anything like that. Okay and do you normally get headaches? I'm not really prone to them no, no but I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago. Okay and what happened then? Just similar. How long did it last for? Couple of days. Did you do anything that made it better? Yeah I had to take painkillers and had to go to bed and rest and had a couple days off work and work in the fashion industry and you know they're wondering what's going on like having to take sick days, you need to get back to work today but you know what if it is a brain tumor what's going to happen with my future and my career you know yeah I'm really worried about this I've never had headaches like this before like why should I get now? Yeah sure and I can see your concerns obviously there's a lot of worry there but you know let's take it step by step and see exactly what the causes of these headaches are first I'm just going to ask you some very yes no questions that's okay have you noticed any problems with your speech at all any typical words? No. Any problems with your arms and legs, for example numbness or weakness? No. Any difficulty with balance or coordination? No. Have you had any injuries to your head? Have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head? No. Okay, alright. And you're feeling otherwise okay? So for example your breathing is okay, you're not feeling breathless? No, okay. Do you have any other medical history I should be aware of? No. So for example, have you ever told you you've had migraines in the past? No. My mum has migraines but I've I've not been diagnosed. Right, so my next question was about family history. Is there anything in the family? So apart from migraines, is there anything else, anything related to the brain? Thyroid as well. What was that, sorry? My mum has an underactive thyroid as well. Underactive thyroid as well, okay. Okay, any other problems, for example, the brain or you mentioned brain cancer, any other family history of that? No. In terms of medications do you take anything on a regular basis? I take the pill, microgynon. How long have you been on that for? Three months. Is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else? It's for contraception. That's something we may need to have a little discussion about today as well. My next question was about your social, your situation at home. You mentioned you work in a fashion industry. Is your job quite stressful at the moment? Yeah, it's really stressful actually. I'm having problems with people at work, managers putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver and yeah, it's not a good time. Is it getting you down? I don't feel down just feel a bit stressed okay all right and what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally nothing really okay do you do much in the way of exercise no okay who's at home with you I live on my own okay are you coping okay at the moment Fine. Yeah okay. Do you smoke at all? No. And do you drink much in a way of alcohol? No. Okay all right. So normally at least I'd kind of proceed to examination but based on your story I wonder whether you may have a migraine, a migraine type headache. It sounds very classical of that nature, the headache on one side, the throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, sensitive to bright lights. I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious such as meningitis or indeed brain cancer. I know that was a big worry of yours initially. Thank you, thanks so much. I was so worried. that had cancer and oh now you say migraine yeah I guess my mum had similar symptoms to me and yeah it doesn't make sense. Well I hope that puts your mind at ease. Certainly this is the second myobin you've had in the space of a month so I think moving forwards there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important to see exactly what's triggering these headaches. We should also try and treat your headaches today, some strong painkillers would be advisable. So, you know, think about paracetamol or even cocodamol and some anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen and naproxen. How does that sound to you? Hey, that sounds good. And if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we can maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place, something prophylactic medicines. - Okay. - Then we can have a discussion next time I see you next week, perhaps. - Okay. - Okay. Now, a couple of things I want you to think about is if your symptoms aren't getting better in the next two, three days, or indeed they're getting worse, I'd like you to come back and see me straight away if possible. So if your headache's getting worse and not responding to medications or your neck pain is getting worse or you're developing any weakness in your arms and legs or your vision, then I want you to come back and see me straight away. Okay? Okay. Does that sound all okay? Doctor, that's great. Great. Any questions for me? No, thank you. Okay, have a good day. Okay, thanks. Bye. Bye.
