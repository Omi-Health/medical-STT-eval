Hi there it's Dr Smith from Babylon. Hi there. Hi can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address please? Yeah it's Matt Carter and it's 14th of August 1989 and what was the last bit? Your address. It's 1 Babylon Avenue. And are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today? Yes. What can I do for you? I don't really know what's been going on but it's just aching all over. Definitely the last six weeks, it might have been slightly longer than that but it's just sort of that feeling really tired run down. Okay, so when do you think you were last well? Where are we now? We just started April. Definitely Christmas, New Year. I felt relatively well I think. um so since then actually yeah i i was on holiday in um in the states and yeah it probably coincided with some time around then end of january start of feb so do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back uh probably a couple of weeks after i got back were you well when you're on holiday yeah i had a great time very active Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhea, vomiting, anything like that? No, not that I recall. Yeah, not. No, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards. Okay, so just tell me what symptoms you've been having. In terms of just your general health, any persistent cold symptoms or ear aches, sore throat, chest cough, shortness of breath, phlegm, anything like that? No. Any change in your weight at all? I don't think so. I'm probably less hungry but no weight change. Are you eating different amounts? Yeah, probably slightly smaller portions or more of an effort to actually eat everything that's in front of me. Any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat or abdominal pain? No. Any change in your bowel habit, diarrhea, vomiting or blood in the stool? No. Any difficulty pulsing urine or blood in the urine? No, that's all fine. Okay and any other general symptoms like rashes? I don't have any rashes now, in fact I've got a photo on my phone if that's helpful. I'll try and show you, hang on. This was weird, this sort of came up and then disappeared after a couple of weeks. Whereabouts was it? I think sort of calf, back of my calf because I didn't notice it my wife noticed it actually. When did you first notice it? Probably around the end of February, the middle to end of February and then it like it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time and I it faded over a couple of weeks I guess. Did you have any fevers at that time? To be honest that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat I had so possibly a little bit feverish but I sort of put it down to that. Do you know where you got that when it started? Did you get any bites that you noticed? I do quite a lot of walking and we did quite a lot while we were out on holiday as well but definitely Yeah I mean I don't recall anybody I don't remember seeing anything fitting but you often like yeah as you're walking through I was in shorts and boots but you feel the other bit. Whereabouts were you in the States? Just sort of near Yosemite. Okay and any headaches, blood, vision, tingling, numbness? No, sort of headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy. And have you been able to go to work as usual? I've been going to work I don't know how effective it's been but yeah I've been. What's your job? I work for a health technology company actually. Okay and has your concentration been affected or your time and levels in the daytime at work? Yeah definitely sort of tired and yeah less energy sort of probably I think than I would normally be. Have you been able to exercise okay? Not as much I don't know if it's I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it I'm not exercising as much as I would normally. Okay and how's your mental health your stress levels I look pretty good at the moment actually like previously that has been an issue but other than sort of physically feeling a bit crappy I'm in a pretty good place. Apart from that rash, any other rashes on your skin or swelling of your joints or pain in your joints? Aching shoulders, back, hips, knees. Any swelling that you've noticed? No. What, hands, wrists, ankles, toes? No. Okay. And any other significant medical problems in the past? I mean, hay fever do make out. Pardon? Asthma and hay fever do make out. Okay, any flowers do you have asthma recently? No, it's pretty well controlled. Do you take any regular inhalers or other medications? Yeah, I've got one of those preventers, I think. Yeah, I take twice a day, but I've not used one. You haven't been used yet? I've been using the every day for the morning and night, but not the W. Okay. And do you take any other medications? I take one of the antihistapines of the pharmacy. It might be kirozine, can I get that from the pharmacy? Yeah, that's fine. And do you smoke? No. Drinking the alcohol? Sorry, occasionally, that one. Okay. And who do you live with at home? Just my wife. Sorry. So with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, it's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels. I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the normal things like liver, kidneys, blood count, et cetera, but also some more specific things like a bacterial infection you can sometimes get, including one that you can get, which can produce a rash like that. So that would involve blood tests. Are you happy to do that? Yeah, I'm generally happy with blood tests. What's the infection? Well, you can get a bacterial infection caused, it's called Lyme disease, but you can get a rash from a tick-to-to-to. So that's something people would do a test for as well. And if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it. So it's definitely worth checking for, but we would also check just for other things which can cause reduced energy tiredness and aching for persistent over six weeks. So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line, and then when you've had the test, arrange a follow up about a week after you've had the test done. Okay so do the test first and then and that follow-up we can just do over the phone again. Yeah we can do that over the phone to start with. Excellent. Okay. That's really helpful thank you very much. Oh sorry he broke up a bit. Any other questions? Oh no not. Okay that's great take care. Take care thank you. Bye.
