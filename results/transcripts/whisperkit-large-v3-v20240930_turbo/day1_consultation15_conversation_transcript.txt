Hello? Hello. Hello, can you hear me? Yes. Great, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age please? Yes, I'm Laura Parkinson and I'm 45. 45, alright Laura, well how can I help you this afternoon? Yeah, so I have soreness in my fingers and my finger, like the skin on my hands is kind of cracked. Okay, when did this all start? A couple of months ago, like three, four months ago. Okay, so it's been that long, has it? Yeah. Okay, and so you mentioned your, is it the skin on your hands mainly that's dry? Yeah, I haven't noticed. I mean, I have dryness in other parts, like my legs, but it's not very, it's not severe. I don't hydrate very much. Right. Okay. Yeah, it's very bad in my hands. Okay. Can I ask, why have you come to see me today? Is it because it's got worse recently, your symptoms? Yeah, I mean, it's gotten to a point where it hurts a lot and I can't really do my job, so I thought I should probably get it checked out. Yeah, that sounds like a very sensible plan. Which part of your hands are affected mainly? The palm. Okay, alright. Have you noticed any itchiness in your palms? Yeah, it's itchy. Not all the time, but yeah, it does get itchy. okay any bleeding at all I don't I mean no I don't think so you scratch yourself often and bleeding yeah I guess when I scratch it yes it has bled sometimes but yeah otherwise it hasn't bled on its own okay fine Okay sorry I'm writing notes as we go along. And you mentioned the skin is quite cracked as well, is that right? Yes that's right. Okay all right. I know it's a long time ago but do you remember how it all started? What were you doing at the time when it all started? Anything you may have done to bring your symptoms on? I do work as a housekeeper and to be honest I'm not always very good about wearing gloves. I switched jobs four months ago. I've been working as a housekeeper for a while though but that's the only thing I can think of. Yeah I think that might be quite important actually, I think there's definitely maybe a correlation between the two. Fine, and so you mentioned something about having general dryness, you mentioned your legs as well? Yeah. Sorry. Is that something you've had for a while now? Yeah, it's not really major. Yeah, it's just a little bit of drainage in my legs. Right, okay. I'm just going to ask you some very brief yes or no questions. With your symptoms, have you had any other symptoms such as fever or temperatures? No. Any nausea or any vomiting? No. Any problems with your bowels? No. Any problems with your urine waterworks? No. Otherwise you feel well, do you, in yourself? You're eating and drinking, your appetite is well maintained? Yeah, I feel good. Okay, all right. Fine. In terms of your past medical history, do you have any other conditions at all? I have diabetes. Do you know if that's type 1 or type 2? Type 2. Diabetes, okay. Anything else? No. Any skin problems? No. Eczema, dermatitis, for example. Not that I know of. No, I haven't been diagnosed with that. Okay. Which medications do you take? Hepformin. Hepformin, okay. Do you have any allergies either to any medications or in general? Yep. Okay. Family history wise is there anything I should be aware of? Diabetes as well. Diabetes as well? Yes. Okay. Again, any skin problems? No, not that I know. Any history of asthma or bowel problems? No. No, okay, all right. Fine, in terms of social history, you mentioned that you work as a housekeeper and you're not always very good at wearing gloves. You recently changed jobs, which kind of places do you work in, is it mainly residential or is it commercial? It's a hotel. Hotel, okay. I do the whole thing like bedrooms, bathrooms, filters. Do you think there might be a relationship between the two, between the products you're using and your symptoms? Yeah, I usually use both for bathrooms but yeah, bedrooms and corridors are not always. Okay. Have your symptoms stopped you from doing any work? Have you had to take time off work recently? Yeah, like the past three days I haven't been able to go to work. Okay, alright. Can I ask a couple of questions? Do you smoke at all? No. Do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Pints a week. Once a week? A couple of pints a week. A couple of pints a week, okay. So very minimal alcohol there. Have you tried anything for your symptoms? Have you tried anything over the counter, any creams? Yeah, I've tried E45. Any luck with that? Yeah, no, it didn't really do anything. No, okay, alright. I was trying antistamines, but it didn't work. Okay, alright. - Mrs. Parkinson, so I think based on your story, I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis, which is very common in particularly people in your field who are using cleaning products, not using gloves, you can sometimes get a bit of a reaction between the chemicals, and your skin. Moving forward, there's a couple of options. Firstly, what we try and do is avoid the triggers. In your case, I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times. In terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin, we can try some steroid creams to help with inflammation. as well as some stronger emollients which you really need to kind of coat on throughout the day three four times a day for the next couple of weeks just to help with the moisturizing of your skin if it still hasn't got better in about a week to two weeks time I really want you to come back and see me again and we can maybe think about other things we can give to you is that all clear? yeah that sounds good great do you have any questions for me? Where do I get the medicines from? I'll do a prescription for you now and send it over to your pharmacy. Okay great. So you said a couple of weeks it should get better right? I think a minimum couple of weeks, 10 days to 14 days and if it still hasn't got better or indeed if it's getting worse, if it's spreading or dryness is getting worse, come back and see me sooner. Okay. Great. Thank you, Laura. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye-bye now. Bye.
