Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Yeah, I can. Can you hear me? Hi, my name is Dr. Gohil. Hi, I'm one of the physicians that works at Babylon. Are you in a quiet and private space to talk? I am, yes. Good, and can I confirm your name and date of birth please? It's Joe Bloggs, it's the 7th of June 19th. 74. 74 and how old does that make you? Sorry 54. Perfect. I'm supposedly 53. Great and it says here it says you're having chest discomfort is that correct? That is correct yes. discomfort in my chest. Okay can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort when it started and how you're feeling at the moment? Sure, it's been ongoing for a couple of hours now. I'll say that it's gone quite suddenly. I was digging in the garden and if I had to describe where it is somewhere in the middle of my chest and it's more it feels more like a pressure they discomfort them more than a pain um if I had to if I had to describe what that discomfort feeling is it's like someone sitting on my chest and Great, so you've talked about your chest, are you still in discomfort at the moment? Yes, as we said. Okay, and when it started, how would you rate it out of 10? Okay, about a 7 out of 10. 10 being very unbearable and severe pain, 7 is quite manageable, it's quite discomfort. And how about now? It's still the same. Okay and tell me before this happened what were you doing? I was relaxing My wife and we're watching Jeremy Kyle. Okay. Still gardens the garden. Okay and how often do you do gardening? Every other week so fortnightly. Okay and are you normally fit and well so are you normally okay to garden as you would? Yes. Great and apart from this do you have any other medical problems? High cholesterol and they've had hypertension. Okay so that's high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Do you take any medications for that? No, I do take any medicine. Are you allergic to anything? I agree. Okay, so let me summarise what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago and you experienced chest discomfort which was roughly seven out of ten. It feels more like someone sitting on your chest as opposed to pain. Yes, that's fair. And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual, specifically with your breathing? Yes, I have. I've got shortness of breath. I feel slightly lightheaded. Okay, and is that getting worse or better? It's remained the same although I'll say recently I've noticed in terms of sort of breathing I've had some difficulty climbing stairs and if I had to sort of walk uphill there's that sort of challenge as well. And when you get short of breath when you're walking up the stairs have you noticed any pain? No pain as such but there's often calf pain and leg swelling. Okay so let me confirm you have the pressure at the moment and you have shortness of breath is that correct? That is correct yes. So given what you've told me about your past medical history I think it might be worth you calling an ambulance Okay. Get you to the hospital as soon as possible because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart. So, while I talk to you, I will ring an ambulance who should come to your address. Right. But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone so I can gather some more information that we can give to the paramedics. Is that okay? Should I be concerned about anything? It's nothing to worry about at the moment but given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol and you've got some chest pain I'm always worried about the heart first before anything. And we need to look after your heart before anything else. So apart from this lightheadedness and this chest discomfort have you noticed anything else unusual? Nothing else unusual. I'm not sure if I spoke to you about nausea. I've noticed some nausea but no vomiting yet. Do you have anything to eat or drink this morning? No. And you still feel nauseous at the moment? I have, yeah. I am, yes. So I have a couple of other questions to ask you and I'm going to reel them off. So apologies for not letting you talk very much. No, that's fine. Have you noticed this pressure radiating to your head? Not to my head, no. And how about to your left or right arm? Yes, there is some pain in my left shoulder and arm. And does that pain go anywhere else to your left arm or to your back? No. And have you noticed any problems swallowing or drinking water? No. Good. And have you noticed any problems going into the loo? No problems going into the loo. And you're normally fit and well apart from the two things you told me about? Yes, however there are some problems just performing daily activities. Like I said with the difficulties climbing upstairs and going uphill I try to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house, nothing to stress. And do you live at home with your wife at the moment? Yes. I would suggest if she's there you let her know that you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today so she might need to get your things together. Got it, I get it. The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime I would suggest that you stay calm and have some water if you need to. Don't take any of those medications. The paramedics should be with you very shortly. So when they do come there are two things they will be worried about. The one is your chest, so your heart and the second is your breathing which is your lungs. So they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate so don't be worried. And when you get to the hospital, you'll be seen by a consultant pretty much immediately. Yeah, that sounds reassuring. Sure. So I will let the paramedics do their job. And when you're at the hospital, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how everything's going. Oh, that's great. Great, I'll book another appointment to see you soon once you've had your adventure. That's perfect, thank you so much. No problems, do you have any questions for me? No questions, I'll just await the ambulance. Great, thank you very much. No problem, I'll speak to you soon. Thank you so much. Bye.
