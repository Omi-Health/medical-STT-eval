Hi Hi Hi, how are you? Yeah, I'm alright, thanks. Although I'm actually feeling a little bit wheezy. Okay, my name is Dr Gohue. I'm one of the different people that work for Babylon. Can I confirm your name and date of birth, please? Yeah. My name is Tina Smith and I'm 40 years old. Okay. And are you in a space that's quiet and private? Yeah, yeah. I'm just in my room. And you mentioned that you're wheezy. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Yeah, so it started like about two days ago. I don't know if it's because, you know, I was like cleaning the house and like all this dust came out of the carpet and you know I've always thought that maybe you've got an allergy to dust or something so I don't know if it was triggered by that. You know two days later still not gotten any better so just getting a little bit worried about it now. Okay so you were cleaning the house two days ago and that's when it first started? Yeah that's right. Did the wheezing start suddenly or was it gradual? So it started after maybe an hour or so. And has it got worse over the past two days? Yeah, so it gets a bit worse at night I find. Okay. And have you taken anything for the wheeze? No, no I haven't actually. Okay, so the wheeze has been getting worse and today you're particularly worried, is it because you're finding it hard to breathe or finding it hard to talk? Yeah, a bit of both actually. So I'm feeling like a little bit short of breath. Okay. And actually when I'm talking to my friends and stuff, finding that sometimes I'm unable to complete my sentences. It can get really bad, yeah. And when you can breathe and you take a deep breath, do you notice any pain? No, no pain. And have you noticed yourself feeling dizzy or the room spinning more than normal? No, no dizziness, none of that. And have you been eating and drinking okay, particularly water? Yeah, I think I'm having like four or five glasses a day. Okay, and are you normally fit and well or do you have any other medical problems? Well actually I used to have like a bit of asthma as a child and also in the summer I sometimes get hay fever. And when you get hay fever do you take medications for it? Not really. Okay. And your asthma, did it resolve when you were a child? I think mostly, yeah. I mean, sometimes when I run for like long periods, it can start up a bit. But I have like an asthma inhaler used for that. Okay. So do you still have your inhalers? I think I might have one from like a couple of months ago. Okay. But you don't see your doctor regularly for asthma? No I don't. Okay. And apart from this do you know if you're allergic to anything? Not that I know of. Okay, and how far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment? Sorry, could you repeat that? How far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment? I'd say maybe a minutes drive away. Okay, good. So, given that you've had a history of asthma when you were a child, and you get hay fever sometimes in the summer, your shortness of breath hi I've lost video signal can you still hear me yeah we've just turned off so given you've got a history of asthma and hay fever this could be one of two things but we want to rule out asthma or an allergy first So what you need is visit one of our clinics so we can do some more tests. So the first thing we would do is use a small device on your finger to check the amount of oxygen in your blood. Okay. And from that we can tell if it's asthma or something else. Right, okay. Before this happens, if you've got something like an antihistamine which you normally take for hay fever at home, I would take one just in case it is an allergy you've had from the dust. Oh okay, yeah I don't have any antihistamines at home unfortunately. You might be able to get one on your way to the doctor's surgery, if not they can prescribe you one. Okay, okay so I can just get it over the counter then? Yes and they're normally about four to six pounds. Great. Is there anything else that you're particularly worried about or want to ask me? Not really, I mean I have before taken steroids for asthma, I don't know if that's relevant. Yes that is and you may need to take some steroids now but we won't be able to know until we've done those tests first. Okay, okay. Cool, so I'm going to write a letter for your GP just to let him know what's happened and the consultation with the GP in person shouldn't take too long. All right, how long do you think it will take? Probably 10 minutes. Okay, that's great. Cool. You should get the letter over the app and then you can take yourself to the GP. All right. Cool. Thank you very much. Okay, bye. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.
