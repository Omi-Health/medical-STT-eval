Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me okay? I can hear you but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Is that okay? Am I meant to just... It's audio. No, no, it's actually fine. Now before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? So my name is Dan Chowdhury. I am 27. 27, okay. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan? So I've just been having some troubles. Basically, I guess it's been a little... while now and I've just been feeling not so great and it's all come from like it's like basically I think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out like loads of it like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it yeah it doesn't feel very solid it's so just it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's uh yeah it's just uh not not being very pleasant and like i just it just kind of hasn't doesn't feel like it's getting better so wow no sorry to hear i think that there's a lot going on there when did it all start your symptoms um so i think it was a few when i think about it So Monday, Tuesday, I think it was about three, it's been about three days now. Okay. And is it mainly diarrhea? So you mentioned watery stools. How many times are you going a day, would you say? So I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Right, you're losing a lot of fluid there. Yeah, so I mean I'm trying to drink a lot of water but yeah it's just quite a lot and it's yeah I think I feel like it's just just fluids coming out. Okay, have you got any blood in your stool? So, no, I don't remember anything like, no, I think it's just nothing like that. There's nothing like that. And any tummy pain? Any pain in your tummy? Yeah, I mean, I feel a cramp and then I know it's time to go, right? So around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go. So yeah, I mean, that's the kind of first sign. Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? It's kind of, if I think about it, it's like at the bottom. I don't know if that makes sense. Why don't we start with, is it in the middle or is it to one particular side? I think it feels pretty like in the middle to me, not on any side left or right. And is pain come and go or is it there constantly? um it comes and goes it comes again okay and if I was asking us get a 1 to 10 10 being the worst pain you ever had how bad is this pain okay so like um so what do you mean by uh pain so i i think it's maybe is it is this pain that's making you double over is 10 is it 10 out of 10 the worst pain you've ever had or is it more of a kind of a mild pain like a 3 out of 10. i i guess so i'm when i think about it like when i get it i can pretend that i don't feel it so i can still sit down and I can still like cover it up and people don't really notice I I don't know what that means but maybe is that like a six or seven okay all right good um apart from the pain and diarrhea any other symptoms like nausea vomiting Yeah, I definitely feel kind of nauseous. I have vomited. I think it's maybe something to do with like, whenever I have milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit. And actually, yeah, one time I just had some milk and I just completely vomited it. I've been trying to avoid it, but yeah. The vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea, is that right? Sorry, could you repeat that? The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhea, is that right? No, no it's not. Okay, okay, alright. Any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? So yeah I think I feel kind of really hot all the time and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that but it's yeah I'm not like not a normal temperature. Okay so you're feeling hot okay. In terms of your waterworks are you passing urine okay? Yeah, but I guess less frequently maybe, but it seems to be okay. You mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you for example gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else with diarrhea for example? So my brother has actually had something like this for five days. I can't think of what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally deals with this stuff a lot better than me. Is your brother now better? so he's been like this for five days I think he's getting better but I'm not I'm not really sure he said he said he had he's had something for a little while as well okay all right are you having anything to eat a drink if you're I can see you're drinking your coffee but are you keeping it down are you keeping your fluids down So it just feels like the fluids do go down but it just feels like it's going straight through. Okay, all right, fine. When was last time you had anything solid to eat? Which you kept in? So I had some... I mean I had some lunch today but again it just came out pretty loose. Dan moving forwards are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical history? Yeah, I think otherwise I'm fitting well. Yeah, I mean, I'm an okay weight. I can't think of any related medical history. I mean, like my... Yeah, no, I don't think so. I'll take it. You don't take any regular medications then? So I... No I mean I've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately but I haven't been I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. Okay and do you have any allergies to any medications? So I don't have any allergies that I know of. Okay and what about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? So what I mean by bowel is the whole gut really, anything from the mouth or the penis. So yeah my dad actually has colon cancer at the moment. Oh dear, I'm really sorry to hear that. How is he? So, from what I heard, he's kind of... So I don't speak to him that often, so I don't know the exact details and I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing, but he's sort of in his third stage. I'm not sure what that means exactly. Yeah, okay. I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting me a lot and that's quite I guess he's had it for a little while now. I'll make a note of that because it's important to know these kind of details and socially tell me more about your home situation who's at home with you Dan? So not my brother he doesn't live with me I live with my sister and my mum. Okay and how are things at home? In what sense do you mean that? In general day-to-day life are you managing okay? Any particular features? I mean, I think, yeah, it's been tricky going to work with all of this. I dislike taking time off work. I feel like I just want to go when I can, so I try and go. I think at home, yeah I just haven't really, I don't normally actually eat with my family, I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing so I don't think it's affected them and I haven't really been, I haven't really gone into detail with my sister or my mum about it. Yeah I'd just rather deal with these things. You mentioned work, what is it you do for work? So I work at an office in central London, so I work in government. Government, okay. Just a couple of last final couple of questions there. Smoking and alcohol do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? So I smoke I smoke for like socially but not like regularly so normally if it's a Friday or something like that I might have a cigarette or something like that but Sorry? And alcohol? So alcohol, you know, I might have a beer during the weekdays, maybe not that many, maybe on Fridays I have more alcohol. But yeah, buy a lot more units. On it, I suppose, not every week, but maybe once or twice a month, but yeah, I'll go out with my friends and drink a lot, so that's... Yeah. Well thank you for sharing with me, that's very helpful to know. So Dan, just as a conclusion, just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis. Okay. A bit of a basically infection of your tummy, of your gut. There's nothing to worry about, I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days. just like i did for your brother make sure you drink plenty of fluids okay um you can should i just drink like normal water i just feel like every time i drink it's just coming out um but i am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins um so you can get things like diarolite which is a a fluid replacement we can get from the pharmacy it's probably worth recommending that do i need like a prescription for that no you can just get that over the counter okay um you can try just you know regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish but if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days so 48 hours i want you to give me a call back because um you know if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations okay but i think let's let's see how you are the next one to two days okay and we'll catch up soon okay okay so you're saying that I should I could I'll try and buy this diary like what should I do in terms of food and that kind of thing should I just focus on fluids? Food is all yeah absolutely clear fluids you can use soft diet things like soup mash and then gradually build up as much as your body can tolerate but really let's try and keep yourself well hydrated first okay okay is it okay for me to carry on having like paracetamol and things like that absolutely if you are having if you've got a bit of tummy pain if you're feeling feverish then I think paracetamol is very sensible okay okay try and avoid alcohol if you can okay I'll try yeah okay all right then Okay. Thank you for your help. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks for helping me out. Bye. Bye.
