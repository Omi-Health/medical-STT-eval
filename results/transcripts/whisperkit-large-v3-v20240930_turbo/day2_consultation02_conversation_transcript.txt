Hi there, good morning. Hello, good morning. I'm Dr. Dean Mirza from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Okay, before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth? Yes, my name is John Smith and I was born on the 5th of April 19th. okay that's great thank you for that um are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely yes certainly okay great okay so um tell me a bit about what's been happening you said you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow yeah um i just noticed this like about a week ago or something um i have like a weird swelling on on my elbow i noticed that when i was in the shower it's not painful at all or like i feel fine but it's just it's just a bit a bit weird to see that um it's it's slightly warm um and i i kind of feel like this it's a bit fluid in inside or uh sure so so i i want to know what's going on with me and so did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow um it's the the left elbow left okay and have you banged that elbow did you have any kind of injury no not really um not that i know of i haven't noticed anything i can actually like it normally um it's just like i can just see that feels a bit strange. Sure okay and in terms of your job do you do anything physical? Not really no I just you know sit at the desk. Right yeah. Okay and has this happened before? No no I haven't noticed that before I don't have any like history of seeing this I don't remember at sure okay and can i um can i just double check has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that um no well i i do well i think i think i have something like osteoarthritis um it sometimes kind of hurts my joints but in my family i'm not sure Okay, sure. So you said you think you've got osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis? Yes, yes a few years ago. Okay, was that a GP or a specialist or is it a physiotherapy? A GP. Okay, all right. Sorry, can I just double check how old you are please? I'm 53. 53 okay all right and do you have any other illnesses at all? Well not really no, I'm allergic to peanuts. - Are you allergic to any medication? - No, not that I know of. - Sure. And are you on any medication on a regular basis? - No. okay and you normally fit and well mobile active i do i do do some sports i run regularly like two three times a week um yeah no i'm i think i'm healthy okay good good well done that's good that you're doing that on a regular basis okay um and um uh can i is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now uh yes sure Okay, bear with me one second. Right, okay. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that, a bit higher so I can just see the underside. Okay, fantastic, all right. And then just bring it around to this side, essentially, I can see the other side. Okay, fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of the elbow with your fingers, is it hot compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin? it's a bit warm yes it's a bit warmer okay um and um is it very tender when you're pressing on that now if you give it a press does it hurt you at all on the on the tip of the elbow it's it's okay just like next to it like where the the swelling is it's a bit yeah it feels a bit fluid okay all right um what um i noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body uh no not really i have more skin do you suffer from eczema at all no no all right Okay, so what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem is I think it would be worthwhile. This seems like what we call the bursitis. So that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. What I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication. in the first instance and as well as that what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of causes of joint swelling okay so what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some blood test forms to be sent out to your house and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done. And that will involve you having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies. So we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well. Okay? Okay. The time frame for that will be the results will come back to us after about five, six days from now. We take time for the forms to come out to you and if you get the form to get the test done straight away, by the time that we're expecting a result back, one or two days after that, we're looking at maybe six days. And what I would suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint feel it, we can review the blood tests and we can get a gauge as to what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now, it doesn't look like to me that's something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So we are worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint. and your your joint doesn't look like that however if your the elbow was to become very red very painful and the redness was to spread or become you know more intense then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment more immediate treatment okay do you think it's something dangerous like something Could I die from that? No, I don't think this is anything dangerous. Don't need to worry. What I'm doing is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop. This is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward. nothing sinister or life-threatening. What I'm doing is I'm just saying in case things worsen, these are the things that we'll be looking out for and this is what we have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully. And I don't think you're going to have it. But I'm just saying the what-if scenario. Is that okay? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me? um well just yeah i just wanted to know about this um yeah it feels a bit better now to know that okay all right yeah no that's it thank you okay so i i would take ibuprofen regularly okay you can get that over the counter um that's 400 milligrams two times a day and you should take that after food not an empty stomach if you get any heartburn stop taking it okay Sure. Alright, so what I want to do is I'll get the form sent out to you and we are going to arrange a follow-up appointment maybe within a... Actually, you know, the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face-to-face. It's more convenient to do it over the phone. We can do that over the video. You can do that as well. That's your call. But you contact us after you've had the blood test done and we can review things then, okay? - Okay, yeah, that sounds good. I'll do that. If I see that it's getting worse, I'll probably ask for a physical appointment. - Sure, sure, that's a good idea. All right then. Okay, take care then. So just leave that with me. I'll sort those bits and pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll review you after the test. Things go well. - Thank you. All right. - All right then. Take care then. All the best. Bye-bye. - Bye.
