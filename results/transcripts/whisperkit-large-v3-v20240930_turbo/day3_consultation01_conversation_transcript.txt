Hi. Hello. Hi. Hi, I'm Maria. Hello, I'm Dr Jacob and welcome to Babylon. How are you doing? I'm all right, thank you. I feel a little weird today to be honest. Yeah, so just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your full name for me, please? Yes, Maria Trabalotsa. Okay, and your date of birth? That is the 1st of October, 99. Okay, and your email address for me please. Yes, mtraba@gmail.com. Okay, and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we have a confidential conversation. Yes, I think I am, yeah. Good, right. You've mentioned in your patient notes that you're having some sort of lip swelling after you had a sandwich. Is that correct? Yeah, that is, well, I don't think it was, it wasn't a sandwich, but it was It was something with prawns. So basically I sometimes go with my friends to this place called Fat Park and we regularly have, usually I have a normal vegetarian soup or something and then I wanted to try something new. So what happened was I ordered a prawn soup. It's called a lax, it's like soup. I ordered a prawn one this time. And then my lips started feeling a little weird, just in the corner, so that one left first. I don't know and then we went back we had a little bit of a chat of banter I wasn't really paying attention now I feel that that there is a swelling yeah there is like a swelling on my on my upper lip and it's kind of getting bigger I don't know what to do right so when did you have the prawn soup what time That must have been just after work so maybe like around 7. Okay, around 7 o'clock. And how long did it take to develop the swelling? Well, I wasn't really paying attention so It must have been like, must have been like, I don't know, half an hour maybe? Okay, in half an hour you develop the swelling, yeah? Yeah. Okay. And it's getting bigger and bigger? Yeah. You still feel it like, really pumping blood and it's kind of getting bigger it feels like it's getting worse. Okay so just a few more questions. So you mentioned about your swelling of your lips is there any feeling of swelling in your throat like your throat is closing up any feeling like that? Yeah actually I feel like I can't breathe that well right now. Okay and do you feel like like your chest is tight? I don't know if it's the chest, just generally feels a little difficult. Okay. Yeah, it might be, I'm not sure. Okay, right. And just a few, have you ever had these, any kind of lip swelling in the past? Stop eating any food. Yeah, well maybe. I remember like a year ago, a year ago I was out with my friends and I think we went like to a late night Chinese place and I remember that I was quite drunk to be honest and I remember that after having that very late I woke up the next morning quite swollen up and had also felt really bad quite difficult breathing but I didn't know what it was I had it was like a curry or something. Okay and what did you take at that time? Did you use anything like antihistamine or anything when you had that last time? Well I generally have asthma so I take what's it called, salbutamol inhalers? Yeah Yeah, so I do take that regularly but I've always taken it. I generally have asthma. And any other inhalers? Is it just the salbutamol that you use? Any other brown inhalers? No, I don't think so. Right. And so do you use anti-histamines like Cetrazine, Loretidine, Peritone, any of those kind of things? No, I think sometimes, but I don't know which ones. So I have a peanut allergy as well. I've always had it. I think I do get antihistamines for that, but I'm not sure which ones. And any point, because you had peanut allergy, any time you had to ever use like an injection? When I was a kid, I think I remember my mom told me about it, but I don't know what it was because I was small and I changed doctors since. Right. Has your mom ever said that you had to go to hospital because you had a severe allergic reaction? Yeah. When I was like six or something, I think, oh, sorry, the swelling is getting. yeah I think my last night are you okay now okay right do you have any kind of antihistamines with you at the moment No, I don't think I have. Right, okay. I'm really a bit worried about you at the moment, Maria. I think we need to call an ambulance because from what history you've been telling me, it sounds like you could be going into what we say an an apatholactic reaction that's when your throat and your chest you know closes in and you might need an injection like what your mom's um you know what your mom told you as you were a young child okay right so is there any anyone with you at the moment or are you alone I'm alone at the moment. So hang on the line while I'll call the ambulance, okay? And I'll send them right to you. Okay? Somebody just came. Somebody just came. I'm not alone anymore. Okay, somebody just came. So just call the ambulance. Make sure that person's with you till the ambulance comes. Because we are worried about an anaphylactic reaction. So you need to go straight away. Could you ask the person whether they have any antihistamines around in the interim while we are waiting? Yes. Mom, do we have any antihistamines around? Yes. Yes. Oh, yeah, we do. Straight away. And if mom can call, mom, if you can call the 999... 999 yeah and say that there is a suspected anaphylactic reaction and they need to come straight away okay yes she said she will yes so straight away take the anti-histomines in the meantime all right okay okay you come up from the hospital do you give us a ring back we might need to sort you out with your injections and things like that. Okay? Yes, yes, will do. Yes. Okay then, take care. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
