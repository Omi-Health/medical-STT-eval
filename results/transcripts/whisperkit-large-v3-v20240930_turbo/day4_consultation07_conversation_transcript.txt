Hello, can you hear me okay? Yes, I can. Can you hear me? Yeah, good, good. So my name is Joe, I'm a doctor here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name please? My name is Vincent. And your date of birth? 9th of May 2016. Okay, great. And I'm in a safe place, oh sorry, a safe and confidential place to talk and just happy to go ahead with a consultation. Yes, yes I am. Great. So how can I help? Yeah, so I have a call that I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week and it's been causing me problems. I've had to stay away from work for about three or four of those days because of how bad it. Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week. And what came first? The sore throat skin first and then after a day or two the cough. Okay, okay. And are you puffing up anything? No, it's very dry. Okay. So I'm just going to ask a few questions about your current symptoms and then a little bit about your background. and something I suspect what we can do a little bit later on in the consultation to help you. Before I go on, anything you're particularly concerned about or have any ideas what might be going on? You said that you had a cold. Well, I mean, you know how we all are. Once this happens, you Google it and it seems to be all kinds of bad things. It could be It could be a cold or flu obviously because tuberculosis, cancer always comes up so it would be good if none of those. Right so yeah I can provide a little bit of reassurance and we can talk about those a little bit as well. And was there anything you're particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation? Well, yeah, so reassurance. So hopefully in some sense, that's not anything too serious. But also, if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better or any advice or maybe even a sick note. So if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer, I can get one. Sure, sure. Okay. All right. So we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms and I'm sure we can get those things, a significant risk and some reassurance about your concerns. So you mentioned that you started with a sore throat about a week ago, developed into a bit of a dry cough. I'll just ask a few questions around those. So do you have any shortness of breath? Yes, yes, I've been having short breaths. You are short breaths. And do you have any wheeze or chest pain? Yeah, a bit of a attack. You're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well? Yes. Okay. And when did you start to develop a shortness of breath? So the sore throat, so today is Friday, sore throat was about last week Friday or Thursday, cough was Saturday or Sunday, so the shortness of breath was shortly after the cough, maybe a day or two later, three or four days ago? Three or four days ago you started developing symptoms. And is the cough worse at night time? No, it's the same throughout the day. Same throughout the day. And when you say you're short of breath, just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are. So are you able to walk up a flight of stairs, for example, or are you short breath of rest? Oh yeah it's like when I'm doing walking and I do exercise now and then so it hasn't been super bad like hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things but it's been pretty unusual and a little bit worried. And you're a bit concerned about that okay so I just need to ask a few things about your background as well so do you have any other medical conditions or medical history? No, just no, no past medical history. No past medical history. No history of asthma? No. And any history of clots on your legs or your lungs? These are DVTs or P's. No one in your families had those, clots on the legs or lungs? Well, my mother had lung cancer. Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke? No. Have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos? I don't know if asbestos ever smoked. I mean once or twice in Amsterdam, exactly, but not really. - Okay. And this, just going back to your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough, it's a dry cough, not cough, cough, phlegm. Do you have, and you say you don't have any chest pain as such, are you taking any medications currently in the moment? - No, I'm not. - Okay, are you allergic to any medications? Not any medication but I'm allergic to peanuts. You mentioned that your mother had lung cancer and any other family history of any significant illnesses running in your family? No, no that's the only one just lung cancer. from my mother okay and you say you have a cold so do you have sinus congestion or um no it seems to be all entirely with just my throat like my nose is just your just your throat and any recent travel or have you always lived in the uk - No, so I haven't always lived in the UK. So I was born in the US and moved over about 12 years ago, but in terms of recent travel just to Europe, nowhere too exotic. - Okay, so no recent travel, no significant recent travel anywhere. Okay, and are you coughing up anything other than, so you're not coughing up blood or anything like that? - Okay, good. And are you feeling feverish, hot, cold, sweaty? - Yeah, so a little bit feverish at first. So the first three or so days of this, but then the fever's gone away. - Okay. And in general, do you- - I've had a fever. yeah yeah i was just going to say also had a bit of a headache uh like headaches that come and go rather but like right now it's fine okay and in general would you say you're feeling you're beginning to to feel better worse or or sort of um staying safe so it's like it's up and down so so let's see so i started last week and i stayed home from work two days this week i think it was maybe tuesday and then thursday so like i felt better and then worse again and then better and then worse again so it's been A kind of constant, but constant can be a variable. - Okay. And I just need to ask any other sort of risk factors that you may have. So no sort of significant weight loss or unexplained weight loss, any waters? So no weight loss but I have been losing my appetite recently and I mean I usually eat a lot so I enjoy eating as well but like that's been a bit concerning. You've been losing your appetite recently? Yes. And you're a little bit concerned about that but you haven't lost any weight that you think of? No, not that much. And any sort of rashes or anything and you - No, no, Ash. - Okay. So I would ask to examine you now, but I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat at least to see if there's a, probably-- - Oh, we can try it. - Oh, no, well, no, it's okay. I might think about doing it. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck that you can feel? - No? - Not the, no, okay. And so finally you were talking about, I mean, it sounds to me that you've been a little bit up and down, sore throat, developed a dry cough, you are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of the consultation now, is if you feel significantly worse, if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness, or breathlessness that you are concerned about, and I would advise you to see a GP and actually see somebody physically. But I think for now I can sort of try and reassure you that if this clears up as I expect it would, so expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days. If it's not, please get in touch with the medical professional gain. And I would expect it to, and so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis. Your concerns about lung cancer are... Was that the other thing you were concerned about? - Oh yeah, yeah. - So again, if you're not getting better, please see somebody again. I've just got four seconds now, so nice talking to you. And we've got to tidy up, yeah. Okay, so... And I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days of work and paracetamol, lots of fluids and rest up. And as I say, if you're not feeling better, please get in touch. Okay? All right. Have a good day. Thank you.
