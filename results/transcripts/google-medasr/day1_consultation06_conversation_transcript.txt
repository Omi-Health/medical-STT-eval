Uhm right based on based on your history and having listuntelligible story, uu I wonder whether you had the flareup of your heart failure uhm which can sometimes happen uhm uhm and know it go on so seem like your heartn pumping as well as it should be uh obviously having diagnosed with heart failureible uh [unintelligible] come mind. Uhmunintelligible option forward uh given that you otherwise well at moment and having examine your chest and your saturations and blood pressure all okay, I am quite happy to increase your dose of furosemide maybe rather than one tablet dai can give be two tablets daily for the first few days uhm and see and see how you are getting on. Okayig I think is doing wor treating your symptoms, but what we should also think about is maybe doing couple of other tests like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogramJ sc ma this [unintelligible uh yeah In remember nowinunintellan today and may take a week or two weeks for that to be organized, but I think certainly in the meantime this uhm le let's get blood test done, we can check for uhm the for blood count leukosigns of anemia, we can have a check your kidney function uh and we can definitely increase your uh your furosemide to un one tablet twice a day. but real would like you come back and see him me in about a week's time and see how getsing on. That is unreasonable I think that sounds like p and of course in the meantime, if you are getting more andwell if getting more breathless or you having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness, then you know saidtellig w to give me a call ster than and we can have a cha on the phone as well.unintell pretty clear. Thank you very much Thk you.</s>
