Uh yeah so u know theu Ventolin stero [unintelligible] Ventolinunin. Uhm to the honest, I was away at uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me, so I have really in the past week [unintelligible because I am sorry they ran out and I forgot to go and grab the next one you have't go any or any [unintelligible] No with me right now I ra out  uhm uh any drug allergies you know no no not allergic to anything, just like justu dust and stuff but nothing no drugsig medical problems Uhm young and mom has eczema and my dad has asthma.  oh when I was young, I also had eczema and I hadu milk protein allergy when I was young to. Uhm so just uh do you have any otherigible concerns ides about not really like I feel like asthma is probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers would be helpful Uhunintig scary because I haven't had a time like this where I have been so tight uh in a long time actually [unintelligible Uhm well it sounds like if you had this cold, you got wheezy with a cough uhm and it nonproductive cough and you short of breoughth. Uh the cough worse at nighttime. I think he gets a little bit worse at night but basically just pretty consistent has gone away not really pain, it more like tight just feels like sometimes ba Uhm okay well I would quite like touh star to gett you some Ventolin tounintellig] you had asthma exacerbations in the past, not in a long time. Now it is young, a little bit more like back in high school,u but I have been pretty good of taking my med my inhalers, so not not so much anymore.unintellig anpientYah when I was in high school, I had to have a tube [uninelligible] you went to hospital and had uh you stayed in hospital for a few days due with an asthma exacerbation. kay currently just on Ventolin andig176 uhm just quantify how short of breath you are  [unintelligible] f to like wal up flight of stairs okay, walking the flat okay without getting too short of breath or uh you short of breath at rest. Uh I definitely not short of breath at rest like except for that feeling I describing. It does when I am walking upstairs, I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be k know short of breath re the mi so no nom not okay fine, so what what I uhm and just discard ituh isthing you type about getting other than the uh i prescriptionhi know that I am okay so like keep I don't want to have to get uhm that that intubation againa I think what we can is gi you a prescription for uh some more of the inhalers. We can get that to within the hour I would hope uhm and uh I think what the other thing I would like to do is just give you a dose of steroids so this these are tablets whichu you can take for five days uh two tablets in the morning and that should just bump and down your asthmatic response okay. Uhm now there are some side effects to the steroids which I should really tell you about but please read the label [unintelligible] do be too worried about the side effects.unint most you know mo most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated and you pro- do have you had them in the past you knowt are cutting in out a little bit there where say have you had steroids in the past. Uhm I can't rememberun [unintelligible] so uhm they can come they can make you your mood change. can be slightly low or still slightly high. C can give you high blood sugar uhm and uh that that can also cause rash, nausea, uhm headaches but mostly is well tolerated and it should help youtelligibleible for lot. Uhm uh where I do is any these the some prescriptions for  inhalers are ongoing so we can wantce to get better from thisunpirin IYou can use the cleal modulate in the morning with Ventolin as a p.r.n. but so uh Ventolin when you need to u get [unintelligible]. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than uh every three hours uhu at anytim is good. I did seek medical attention [unintelligible see a doctor u in some custd uh and one thing I would like to send you was a spacer which would allow the medication to actually uh I will send you another one and I have some instructions about how to use it essentially a couple of pst depprimment inside breathing in and out uhm uh for five five1 breath.k yeah to uh wasel that your mind concned [unintelligible kay and and uh might give you some time off work as well you can self certified for seven days but I think I would advise youun [PN] no any deterioration in your symptoms like worsening shortness of breath uh and or just generally concerning symptoms, uh pain in chest tightness, uh feeling lightheaded, u then seek further medical attention and. Okay [unintellibleay thank you thank you bye bye. Be bye.</s>
