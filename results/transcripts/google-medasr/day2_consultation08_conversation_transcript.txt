Uhm as I said, I haveve I have been struggling with back pain the quite a while, but hasn't really had any uh major ill Uhm they have said that it is uh related to long periods of time sitting at a desk and justu bad postures and mainly the exercises are focused on improving posture and and strength of the muscles in the backunintelligible] illnesses in your fa tool.Uhm the main one would be uhm to ta my my thought that passed away [unintelligible] [uninellig happened. Uhm un6ell8 I think yeah] okay uho younew medication uh justun that okay uh you have the allergiesunint time you medication.ible Uhm moderate alcohol intakeuninellig drink too much how muchphyic I try do some moderate physical exercise a few times a week right Uhm so uhm whatuh I think we are going to need to do is we going to need to bringintelligible] and we going to need to arrange some blood test as well. so what what I want to do the first question I have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why he got this fe- this fever and these symptoms because there is no apparent reason from what he told me. There is no uh when someone has got fever and sweats, we want to find out have they got chest infection have they got a throat infection uhm and if you cant find a focus of infection, then that is something that that is an outstanding question that needs to be answered. Okay. Uhm the second thing second factor is that you recently come from uh vietna and you had exposure to rule areas and we need to think about thing that [uninelliblea or other exustter infections as well. So uh we are probably need some blood tests after you have been seen by somebody. Uhm now, the urgency of the blood test depends partly on what we find when we examine you, which is why weunig for the examination first. You can come into one of our clinics in centeral Mondon, that is one option and then the the GP that who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood testing things are going to be or if it is inconvenient you to come into centeral Mondon because you you live your living further out, You could actual just attend a local ANE. I am going to timey up what myfulought process is and what kind of tests I think you need in the notes for this appointment, so you could show that to them reception. I am I will be asking because Iquo thickened thin blood films to check for malaria and inflammatory markers and things other. Tech- technical terms, but they do understand what what I amt looking about but uhmu I don' think you are going to work uh until we soulted this out and we we we need tosrt this up sooner rather than later.ay that sounds great. Thank you much [unintelligible] I will send a message minutthat'sper the end} Thank you very much. All okay take care the all best.</s>
