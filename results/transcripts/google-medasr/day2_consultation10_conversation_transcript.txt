[unintelligibleunintelligible [unintelligible] date ofth is so I kind of woke up this morning I described very  horrible pain on the left side of my headual kind of head achy feeling and u br me up uhound  I ga about 7 o'clock.U I mean I [PentName] had a be history with headaches but nothing as severe as this before. So they were less severe with a similar in nature to have been one-sided than the top of pa. uh not so much on the one side it tends to be a bit of a cluster front of my head any way, uh but at this time it is kind of more prominent on the left side which I have never reready had no kind of spread across the front of my headin] and u can I just [unintelligible] and ay and do have any fevertellig how you br at the mo feel set rely handle feelna uh not really like when I first go up this morning, my head goought a bit dizzy, but that is kind of ft it now and I seems to be finekay uhm and ell uhm and uh Uh it is kindtstress the moment, I have got a lot going on and yeah I seem to have like a lot of kind of a btelligible w that need to go through it the moment so I have kind of been doing a lot of late night as well uh and uh how has not been the caseful uh probably about a couple of months now.How you say your mood is uhm Im not like moody I a not angry or uh like I gab bit frustrated during the day uh but it kind of uh absent flas every now and then but yeah  dignos anxiety or depression or stress in the past I had uh so I had like anxiety for about two years now and have been on sertraline for a while [unintelligible] not not necessarily at work, sometimes I do feel b anxious uh I I kind of just the panic of not being able to get my work done on time,uh but other than feel Uintelligible] Uhm no with yougards this said it is it worse when you lie down or uhm this wor you down. Uh when I liy down like uh kind of feel a little bit sore fast uh and it takes me a while to get comfortable. Uhm sorry yeah the beginning [unintelligible] then again that kind of uhm says a little bit. Okay uhm so would you say ultimatelyuntt yeah say okay uhm and uhm in terms of uhm this headache since this morning you takenthing for yeah I have taken P [unintelligible]ddureloo pressure check nothing M parents uh my mom had a history of anxiety as well, but no kind of life physical illnesses [unintelligible and uhm any medication uhm no other other than sertraline and having taken uhm paras this morning uh nothing else. She ha any allergies to any medication [uninelligible] amare of and I left with my partner smoker andtelligible] a capk andcise a wek Uh so normally I triunintelligible running at least three times a week Uh its okay uh its nothing it nothing uh really healthy uhm that fine [unintelligible] uhm now uhm in terms of this headache, uh I am going to examine you, see you directly but off uhm it sounds like it might be one of two things. It could be an element orquo} tension headache backa that is one possibility uh and what makes that more likely is the fact that you have been under some pression you have a history of anxiety in the pastkay Uh the other possibility is uh migraine as well Big uhm and the fact what makes that more likely is effect is on one side and that you got some sensitivity to light. Okay so what what I think we can do is uhm I think we can give you some uhm generic pain relief that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches. Okay so [inelligible in a second and the other thing that I was going to suggest is we may be look explore things to try and decrease the stress from work. So okay uhm the medication wise thing that we stot our first line if someone had migraine was to would be to stort ibuprofen and uh that the dosage of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal dosage of ibuprofen that is one thing we can start. You can keep what taking [unintelligible] you like but the ibuprofen is uh aually more effective for for migraine and [unintelligible] uhm yeah said that the guidelines have changed recently we we before that we used to getun toline butum ibuprofen and aspirin. Uhm the only thing like it do may be considered taking some time off work because it that due to stress from work uh may bee having a week off if you self-stify that might help with things and I would also like you to explore counseling options as well, so there is counseling service in your area that I can give you the [unigible f to self-refer. that okay let to try that. Uhm what we are going to do is we will have a followup in a week's time as well as those two things, other things are would likely to do is to try to ensure that you are having a minimum of 70 hours sleep at night every night okay a minimum of uh 1.5 to 2 L water or fluids a day and that is not including coffee or tea. Okayr because sometimes dehydration and youu u fatigue can be ca of headaches as well. Uhmuh did is uhuninell those thing. Uhm lets lets try that okay uhm uhm let have a followup appointment. If we are finding that things are not getting better, we might need to arrange some blood tests or uhm look at uh other possibilities, but we will try that in the first instance. Uhm if anything changes in the meantime or you get worried I think it was,pe fre have a low threshold forring us back and the lookooking an appointment and we can reassess the situation. Okay yetelligible thank you very muchlp. Okay no so there will be a summary all of this is the notes uhm and I will also leave re link to just some of the dangerous signs and symptoms of headaches in the notes, if you can read through that in your own time that will just havel you have a bit more control of what's going on and understanding of what what kind of things should trigger you contacting another doctor. Oayunigibletient in a week's time Thank youunintigible]e bye..</s>
