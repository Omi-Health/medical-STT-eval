Do you want to tell me a bit more about when it start you think there is something which changed life that time. Uhm I guess so I think uhm I would say maybe about two months or so every feeling like this and that probably coincides with me starting a new job uhm which uh I would say it's quite stre- I mean every job is stressful uh when you first start but it has been really stressful I think for the past two months definitely [unintelligible] and so I worked for a uh uh fashion retailer in and the head office team and it is just a brond new sex. I have never worked in retail before.y boss is not very nice to me [unintelligible] but I also think that it' just been just really drad going there just haking her hate see everyone and really worried about whether I'm doing well and and it's reallyuncting on like on the rest of my life like I sunleepible like okay.

I am wish happy to have some one-to-one therapy what we would suggest in the be insince to sorry you can self-refer IVNHS for whatuntellig like talking therapy was [uninarelligt tohavioral therapy wherehe they can really look at your situation how reing the what was provoking the anxiety or you can do to try and overcome that and so I can send you the link for that. Uh in the meantime, it can be a bit of a weight. There are some only resources that are read helpful but the details on that you can get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well and and if you feeling like it is not helping tool or your anxiety is getting worse to the point where you cantate with work or you canot just do your normal things day today then it is important for you to give us ahool back and just discuss that further and in some people with anxiety, they do need to take medication to control that but thats not somethingving that weaon suggest in the first instance [unintelligible] and I put some more information [unintellig about helping with you sleep patterns and things are that.U in terms of palpitations, it is lim to be associated with anxiety, but is probably worth having a couple of basic blood test just to make that there is not something triggering that of and</s>
