H she a little b wezy I don't know if it is because you was like cleaning the house and like uhm all the dust came out of the the ct and you know overo the thought that maybe a put of an allergy to like dust uhm so waseated byible] uhm you know two days later do not going to any better so uhm just getting a little bit worried about it now.uninkaible so you were seeing in the house two days ago and that's when it first started. Uha [unintelligible] the wheezing star suddenly was a gradual.Uht and has' got worse over the past two days.Yah gets ait wh Okay souh the wheeze has been getting less and today you will particularly worri is it because you will find the hards to breathe or find the totke. Y [unintelligible feel bit uhh short of breath uh and actually when I am talking u to my friend finding that uh sometimes uhm I'm unable to co- complete my sentences uhmunigible can get re bad yeah and when you can breathee and you take a deep breath, do you notice any paperiodin} Uhmunintelligible] and noticed feeling dizzy or the room spinning more than normal Uh dizziness been eating and drinking Uh um asthma uh as a child uhm and also when [unintelligible] sometim get uhm hazy the and when you get happy would you take medications for it.Uh [unintelligible] ask did resolve when you were child. Uh I think mostly yeah I mean sometimes when I run like long periods, it can it can start up with it, but uhm I have [intelligibleirhalerokay soun you Uhm I think it might have from like coule months ago butn't no I oka and apart from this you know you are allergic to any think uh noun I okay and [unintellible fromor surgery at the moment. So could you think that how far you away from a ductor surgery at the moment. Uh may bee minute away [uninkelligy so given that you had a history of asthma when you were a child and you get hay fever sometimes in the summer, your shortness of breath I have lost uhm video signal can you still he me uhm yeah we just saidunintelligible] so given you to history of asthma and hay fever, this could be one of two things, but we want to rule out asthma or an allergy fast. soo what you ne is visit one of our clinics so we can do some more tests. sory tr check a what was do so the first thing we would do is use a small device on your finger to check the amount of oxygeningal blood. Ookay and from that we can tell if it is asthma or something else. Alright okay before this happens if you got something like an as- antihistamine which you normally takes the hay fever at home, I would take one just in case it is an allergypart from the dust.a if there anything else like [unintellible] Uhm uh not re I mean taking steroids for monthh [unintelligible] and you may need to take some steroids now but we canot fast. so I am going GP just to let him know what has happened and the consultation with the GP in pass and should't take too long. [unintelligible 10 minutes you can take off to the GP. Alright thank you very much. Okay bye.ay thank you bye bye byye.</s>
