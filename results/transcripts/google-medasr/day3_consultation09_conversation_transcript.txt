by date of6 19. Muninellible at Gmel dot coun. correct and just to confirm that you are in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation absolutely. Right, so you mentioned that he have some pain thej uh well I think that is just like the first thing that I typed, but uh it was not really what I you know I just typed it and then I could submit so that wasu uh I mean it is part of the problem but I would say that more of a problem for me is that I can't quite move my left arm, I mean I can move it, but it's its numb and then I also feel some like tingling in my fingertips. numb S I have started taking this boxing class.You have been taking boxing class for a few weeks and I feel like maybe uhm it has probably been I say for at least two weeks and it has kind of gotten worse like he think I just kind of felt a little bit of tingling and then it has gotten it has gotten worse  andince then then the numbing kind of started. I can feel it both in myu uhm you know a little bit in my elbow and then in my arm as well as in my hand and now because it hasn' gotten better, I tried to get a massage, it is not better or you know I tried to take warm baths, it is not better so I figure colio and just figure out what iss going on. mentionedation Uh while it you know it its numb and I I kind of look stuff on line uh but you know I I did take ibuprofen just because my my muscles were sore uh a little bit and I taking his boxing class, so you know I kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand, so that has been a little bit painful, so I have just kind of taken ibuprofen for that but like I said I mean I tried massage, I tried some hot bths that did not help with his numbness I am just kind of getting a little worried you have just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards you again tingling, numbness elbow below not from your shoulder. Uho it' is kind of finnellig you have sometimes I will feel in my shoulder like if I tri to if I try to let you know move like in boxing and stuff, I will even like a uh maybe feel a little bit of a little bit of pain, uh but I would say if I am just like resting if if I am sitting like right now I can feel like it is numb and I I actually feel tingling right now, not in all my fingers just in some. Yeah so which finger do you feel numb. Okay so it's my second, third, and fourth finger hu second, third, and fourth finger and it you pmside all you know the back of the hands fi which is numb although no it it the it the side so the front side. It is the front side right and have you been dropping things at home, but minly try hold onto things like a glass or something not so much with the glass, but I will say uh while I play a little bit of a pianoon, so I just noticed that it's it has been kind of harder to get the notes. I could I can grasp I can grasp a uh a glass, but because I use my right hand most of the time, you know I a not left handed, so I it kind ofunrt me to so you would say so just you get fanly weakness rather than because of the pain you it. is two different things so know sometimes you canode in because iting you it is not hurting, it is not hurting it numb I can feel some form of weak any neck pain at. No no no neck pain. neck pain okay right kay so just a b more of the background because I don't give much information on the system uh do you have any past uh medical history that you got to I guess because of this. you know I am not sure if it is boxing. I also had a really bad cold like a month ago. I mean you know drinking with the friends, uhm one of our c-workers just had his three-year universary and we go to of w crazy and we were like out parting until you know laight hours and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me and then that I was sick for probably good like two weeks. I was at home I think I must to that some kind of like a flu or something. soo that and then I say another we thing that happened to me a few weeks ago is like I all a sudden just could nott see from the uh from my left eye like I I lost some like a little bit of a field of vision uh and but that that just lasted not very long I mean that just lasted maybe for, I don't know 20 to 20 minutes uh and I kind of thought I don't know maybe it was the the cold you know and the virus in all that so I I guess thats what I can you know that is the last thing I can remember, but in general I am I am pretty healthy I mean I you know I work outu what and I I don't really have any medical problems. Do you have any headaches t Uh sometimes I get headaches, but I think they are just tired headaches, you know sometimes I will get kind of tired, but I think that is probably because it work too much or you know because like I will go for a workout and then I will really just exhaust myself and then I just kind of feel this fatigue uh or sometimes like this morning for example, I just felt really fatigued then I could' even get myself to the gym, but you knowe since I have this numbness, it is kind of like hard count right.You w glassesa glosses contact lenses no no so no glasses and you not had experienced anything like a seizure or fi anything like what a seizure and wekness is only leg walking and always no yeah yeah walking is normal.Yah You mention for a while you could not see you know the outside peripheral vision from your left eye. how long did that episode last. You know I think it was only maybe like 20 minutes or so. It iss almost like it happened and I thought I on my God it is probably I am still like sick from this you know virus thing cold and so I just kind of slepped it off and then when I uh uhm when I woke up it was gone. S okay uhm okay so is that any regular medications that you are using not really I just take ibuprofen every once in a while. I take vitamin D. Uhm I take some I I like my G- my GP really wants me to take iron supplements, but you know other this is like huge pills, so I Ihm most of the time I just forget but vitaminD I take and then sometimes I take melatonin to help me sleep and any family history not to sh any significant family history. I know that my dad has I don't know if it's hypo I think its hypothyroidism yeah uh and then my like you just got an autoimmune stuff going on like that much I know and when my mom my mom she is she is actually really not in a great shape. She has got diabetes type two. She has got hypertension. Uhm she got got what is] oh yeah she has got high cholesterol uhm and that is it for hera any neurological conditions in the family u so so you know speaking and examining you knowview cell phone, I think it isquite important that we do investigated a bit fel I am just wondering whether this something a bit more than just the box in here.telligible] things that made me think other than just like a boxing injury is for instance uh you know when you said you can resion when was not there for about untig] with the weakness of the arms make me think is something else going on rather than justjyWhat you think may be going on. S sometimes either you do get things like MS, multiple sclerosis soig multiple sclerosis can have uh visual problems what what experienced and sometimes you know the odd numbness, tingling, sensations going on.a I they can to belate there are treatments for it, okay I am not obviously I am not suggesting that you do have it, but it is quite important to find out that they habital not that the most sering kind of thing that needs to beu dealt with here.unintellig I it might sound about too shot to you, uh but uhu but I think it is the important that we investigate this a bit most seriously right the sentence. If you can any questions at ho or whats okay you are going to do the referral uh should I be taking any drugs or thats some W the treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that uh when you have an acute you know acute reaction of thing but saying that be need to addct diagnosisinig you are waiting for this to be done if there is any weakness you know if the weakness progresses to your legs or there is any kind of headaches, vomiting, feelins and the visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better, then that would be anN okay. Thank you doctor. Yah I'm I am sorry I I did appreciate you are bit worried but you know that you know that you comments spoken to us today and hopefully you will get things soalted and the bowl rolling. Okay. Thank you doctor. I appreciate your time. Thatelligible] Bye bye.</s>
