So I just want to have my ha- my head like really uh not moving ka. Uhm so whate had have he felt sort of nauseous or like he want to vomit.  Oh yeah I I forgot to mention definitely. I vomited twice. Actually as soon as the the headache started, I also vomited. So initially I thought it was something that I ate, but then the headache started to be really bad and I still feel nausea. Soin I am about to vomit very soon, I think or okay you mentioned in the past you had kidney stones and other medical problems sorry you mentioned that in the past you had kidneystnes,H you had any other medical problems in the past. Uh so uh uh not actually uh my mother has migraines. I am not sure if that iss relevant andu also I have hypothyroidism in the family, soo it might be I don't know I I I don't know what else you have in the family. I think weun losing connection sorry I I think we lost connection.Uh can you do yeUh you said youmented your mother has migrainesWhat else you have in the family, hypothyroid hyperthyroidism. She also has hypothyroidism kay kay uhm and no other relevant family history uh no not that I am aware. can you take any regular medications? uh no. Are you allergic to any medications, not that I'm aware uh yeah not that I am aware case there are any chance you could be pregnant uh I really about it fine and you not allergic to any medications finding from and what what what you thinking might be going on do you seem quite worried about it was there anything in particular you are worried about W I am a little bit hypochondriic, so I feel that this can be some kind of brain tum me tumor or something because Im like this is really the pain is so worriable that or maybe a stroke, I don't know. Its its just like you know you hear so many stories that you definitely start wonder if I should go to any urgently because I might really have something serious Uh now just another uh question have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs, anything like that no no ne no no Uh and when you are walking you are able to walk fine in a straight line or is you your wok you walking a bit funny uh not really kay it is really about the head that is why I find it very weird okay so just do' clarify what what you said this morning uh you woke up and then later on in the morning about four hours ago he developed a headache uh on the left side of the head leftside [unintelligible]hind the eye sorry it behind the eye where the pain is uh no no it uh I know describ it but [unintelligible [unintelligible] fi He noticed that your vision is blurry the spny line you feel a bit nauseous. He vomited twice uh yes you feeling dizzy as well, but you no neurological symptoms you are walking fineuninelligible] has not helpedunintellig so it sounds like what you suffering from what know as a migraine. something uh uh now it is the first time. Ikay would I am very familiar with the disease because my mother has it so uh well but I never had it and I thought that the onset of migraine will be you knowing much uh early ages, so that is why I am not sure if migraine makes sense kay. sou usually with with migraines, they can present at different times in people's life, so sometimes they can present as a child, sometimes they can present when they olderu and sometimes they can present you an even postmenopausally. So this is different there is different ways you can get migraines and the reason why this sounds like migraines iss on one side of the head. Within typical of a migraine, you got blurry vision again which is very typical with the nausea and vomiting that is also typical of a migraine. Now uh they obviously if the headache headache is really severe and I will suggest some medication you can try that does not what we would want to see youu as soon as possible to do a lack of full neurological exam as well. I that to make sure that you know this you know we do more specific examination that everything all seems fine. Uh I wo- I would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you uh you take some medications maybe something like ibuprofen. Okay so and uh you you are saying that if this is a migraine and if I tried that medication, this should go away kind of today. So he has a migraine you no you know even sooner than that we can look at maybe half an hour to 40 minutes depending on what your response to it is for some people uh whatever medications they take the migraine does not improve and and it can lost from anywhere from four hours to 72 hours, Mgraines can last. Uh [uninelligunintellig] no so there is a lot of some medication treatment so that they can be ibuprofen with an antsickness so which you can get from the pharmacy and you also to drink a suggaryu carbonate to drink something like Coke. Okay, so the three of them is there is a good sort of cocktail to stop them, then we can go up the treatment let you can get specific migralief medication and that something to try between now one when would see you to do theu to do the assessment. Okay [unintelligible] assessment where we can see you today at some point. Okay uh but however, if you do take the medications and you know by the time your appointment time comes in any feel much bet tr your you can coanceel it Uh you can give us a call counseled.
