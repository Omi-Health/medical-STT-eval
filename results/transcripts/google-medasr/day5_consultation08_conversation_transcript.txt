Uhm have you got an aspirin inhaleru yeah okay so what I would suggest is you take it more regulate the neurologic at the moment. Ha you go a space that at him. Uhm do want to show me how to do it onhow and do have a spacer at him no okay and what I can do is I can prescribe you a peak flow meter so we can check your breathing level and a space that to use your inhaler a bit more efficiently which the pharmacist can show you how you use that when you pick it up ye actual and and if you increase it you are taking it two to four puffs like every four hours initially u if you get high temperature or your wheezing is getting worse, you need to pull us back straight way. so we can just advise you further with that Okay and it will be a good idea when you are feeling better if we could arrange just to review just to see how you as me is because we may need to start some other medication for you. Okay [unintelligible]] review in a week or so uh b but before that and if you if you feeling wasorse.Yar weekri [PatientName] pa [edicName] okay and the other things do would be to take a regular antihistamine which she can get uh from the pharmacy. I can put jnew notes about what to take ahun helpful and then if you when you go the peak flow me if you can take the pharmast can change how to use it and if you could record a val first thing when you wake upu in the evening over the next week and then we can discuss that I the [unintelligible] the figur and see what you need to go on another inhaler as well.Uh [unintelligible] thank you. I you go any questions uhm [unintelligible thank you very much.ank bye</s>
