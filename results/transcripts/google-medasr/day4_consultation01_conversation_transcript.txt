ellhi I am one of the physicians [unintelligible qui [unintelligible] [unintelligible94 74 and [unintelligible]chest discomfor can you tell me this bit more about the chest discomfort when it started and how you feeling at the moment. S uh it has been ongoing for a couple of hours now. Uh they did this go quite suddenly. I was de inard and it itr to describe where it is, somewhere in the middle of my chest andh it is more more like a pressure. the discomfort and more than a pain. Uhm if I had this or if I had decribe don uh yeahkay so you talked aboutellig] chest you still in discomfort at the momentunintelligible] and when it start how you [uninellig a 7/10 which 10 be viousbarable and se pain 7 is quite manageable, is quitecofortable and hold on no uh it pseudo paain and tell me before this happened I was okay and how often do you do goardtenen uhm every other week so for nightly and you normally fit in well, so you normally okay to garden as you would uh yet great and apart from this do you have any other medical problems. uhm high cholesterol and pa hypertension hypertension okay so that's high blood pressure and high cholesterol. you take [unintelligible [unintelligible So let me summarize what you told me already, you regt a few hours ago and you experienced chest discomfort which was roughly 7/10. Y feels more like someone sitting on your chest as opposed to pain [unintelligible] and apart from this have you noticed anything else unusual specifically with your breathing Uh yes I have uh I got shortness of breath. I feel slightly lightheaded. Uh it has remained the same, although I say recently I noticed in terms of sort of breathing of had some difficulty cing instirs and perhapt w hes that challenge as well and when you get short of breath when you are walking up thestirs, have you noticed any pain. Uh no pain as such, but there is often calf pain and leg swelling. Okay so let me confirm you have the pressure at the moment and you have shortness of breath is that correct that is corrected. So given what you told me about your past medical history, I think it might be worse you calling an ambulance get you to the hospital as soon as possible because my concern is it might be something to do with your heart. So what I talk to, I will ring an ambulance who should come to your address. Alrte but in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone, so I can gather some more information that woulduninkelligible with the paramedics. it is okay uhm should I be concerned about anything. There is nothing to worry about at the moment, but given that you got high blood pressure and high cholesterol and you got some chest pain, I am always worried about the heart fast before anyth again and we need to look off through your heart before anything else. So apart from this lightheadedness and this chest discomfort have you noticed anything else unusual. uhm nothing else unusual. Uh I am not sure if I spokig about nausea. I have noticed nausea, but no vomiting. Yeah do have anything to eat or drink this morning uhm no and you feel still feel nauseous at the moment I have yeah I havem yet. So I had a couple of other questions to ask you and I am going to  real them off so probaly for not letting me talk very much [unintelligible] Have you noticed this pressure radiating to your head and left [unintelligible] to your left or right arm uh yesterday the pain in my left shoulder now and does not pain go anywhere else to your left arm or to your back uh no and have you noticed any problem swallowing or drinking water Uh not good and have you noticed any problems going to the li uh no problems [untellibleigible and he will normally fit him well apart from the two things who told me about. Uhm yes, however, there are some problems just performing daily activities uhm like I said with the difficulty climbing upstairs and going up pill. Uh I tried to limit my daily activities to just move around the house, nothing to stretch and you live at home with your wife at the moment, I would suggest if she is there you let her know that you both be having advance to the hospital today, so she might need to things together [uninellig The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm and haps more to if he needs to, do not like any of the medications. Again the paramedics should be with you very shortly. [uninellig so when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about. Okay the one is your chest, say your heart, and second is your breathing which is your lungs. Okay so they will give you lots of things to breathe through and attach things to your arms just to check things like your blood pressure and your heart rate, so don't be worriedoka and when you get to the hospital you will be seen by a consultant pretty pretty much immediately. [unintelligible] reassuring thing So so I will let the paramedics do their job and when you out the hospital, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes to let me know how every things going uh that's great. I will book another appointment to see you soon again make once if how doint answerig.inelligible]k you very much. No problems do you have any questions for me uh no questions, I will just await the aig. G thank you very much. [unintellig Thank you very much. Byig</s>
