unintelligible name is one dau and I am 27 years old. Uhm so I was born in 199117unintelligible] [unintelligibleelligible thanky so tell me what the problem is you having some difficulty breathing [unintelligible]a exact I I am kind of struggling to breathe Iment I I got stunged by ws uhm recently. but I am not sure whether it kind of bits or stung uh but I uh I am feeling like slightly anxious that uh there is a bit of I have got a bit of a rash on my arm where I got stng and and I kind ofviun got this difficulty breathing and potentially uh there is a bit of swelling in my lips and tongue feels a b with right okay when did this bece thing or B bit occur. Uh it was just a few minutes ago right okay uhm and your your lips don' seem swollen to me right now, but today whichah it is just kind of on the rightha sideum and and it is just a bit sore maybe it has kind Uh he said he has been ha some difficulty breathing your breathing seems alr to me right now. Im the reason w I am crifying you because we have to decide whether this is acute emergency whether I ne continuible the hospital straight away or with more time to ask questions okay. So uhm do you feel like you go difficulty breathing right now at this minute as we speak. I I I I don't feel like it is like particularly acute, but I am just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a bit w I don't I just wanted to speak to someone. So you did the right thing and and I can understand that it it is quite anxiety provoking okay. Aalr can I just double check before we carry and other question. Have you got a history of anaphylaxis uh no that I know of no okay. Hve you ever been given an EpiPen. Uh I haven'toy [unintellig lets takeuninpible so in terms of the beeelling is did you see the B or you you just uh assuming was a be Uhm I  I I find it difficult to tellunenceunt] whats but uh one of the two yeah it was one of okay okay and uhm its just just ay to right now the moment. Its it is slightly red yeh and f bit of like a hole punc mark okay alr. Uhm now is is there any swelling around that area that you can see. I I could't see any Uhm not particularly. I I guess it is just a bit kind of blochy uh and a bit of a rash. It does not feel like particularly swollenunt okay alright. Uhm take uh can have any history of any any kind of illnesses to. Uhm I [unintelligible] moka [unintelligible]tthing. Uh I am allergic to penicillin alrightunintelligible] uhm and any your family is any history of any illnesses or any history of anycute [unin not that I think it is particularly relevant not In have and uhm do you have allergies to any kind of capsule dogs [unintelligible] uh no that I know I have been around do [unintelligible] you no food allergies as far as okay. Uhm can I also do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks oruninthing like that uh yeah uh sometimes occasionally [unintelligible]  I been on medication for that uhm not that Uhm great now uh I need to ask a few questions may bee not directly related to this, but just it for for general information purposes. So uhmu are you working at the moment, yes would you work has uh I am a uh computer scientenceence okay and uhm living alone, yes. Okay do you have any pets at home. Uh I have a [unintelligibleintelligible] okay {period} What I would like to do now that's okay joint is I would like to have a look inside the her mouth okay and what things that uh would be worried about someone could have an acute allergic reactions to see whether there is any swelling of the lips or the tissues inside the mouth the soft tissues of the airway and uhm I can I got a fairly good view of your legs, so I would like mab if you can bring your device clo to your mouth and then put in back mouth open why sit some away there good lighting and I wantt have a lookside the throell if thats okay. [Echo it okay great now uhm uhm can cannot just say doo it again In just say uh this time uh okay can test it {period} Okay. Uhm uh don't based on uhm how you look,hi your talking to me and high your breathing and the appearance on your wrist, uhm I don not feel that you having uh an an lifethreatening uh allergic reaction. Now it is very normal to have a rash when you have some kind insectfite this that is a localized uhm inflammatory reaction that uh is normal and that an immediate reaction that redness and that maybe slight swelling is eu toetemporary. What we worried about is when someone has uhm compromise of their breathing, so you mentioned breathing difficulties andimageunigible] I can't see any of that right now right one but that is the most urgent and most pressing thing that will be watching out for. Given that it has not happened initially, it is unlikely to happen later. C so we have like a stage one and stage two reaction for these tox of fites and usually if you can have the rereaction, it will happen straight away. So we we may be coming out to the dangers th now, is uh but I am just go to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case they happen. So for example, you would have swelling of the legs, difficulty breathing, you might have something stridor which is an inspiratory sound that when you trying trying to breathe it makes like a [uninelligibles this. Okay than you do nott have anything like that right now, it seems to me that this is a localized allergic reaction; however, anything changes eventing deteriorates, either make an appointment with us or go straight to AD uhm and in some case if is if is uh progressing rapidly, it is bestter to go straight to any rather than to wait for a book deparintment with us. Okay. What I would like you to do now is I like you to Chantix and antihistamines, so you can b over theecounter you can get perritonin or chorphenamine you can take one tablet 4 mg uhm up to about six times a day okay or you can just take a one a day one wouldtigible] your breafast as that is absolute if I is no no issue that should be enough to control this. Uhm if the redness in your arms spreads and you feels hot or you know he have signs of any localized infection, we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic and not I said if anything deteriorates in terms of breathing gas  we need to process thatunelligible someone actually is to taking urgently. Did any other uhm think I think that that makes me feel a bit better I guess can I get uh gethistamin [unintelligible] now uhm uh on the basis where you told, I don' think you need any allergy testing. I think this is just straightfulward localized reaction to an insect line. However, if it was to happen you know this you you having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other no specific rashes, more you think about blood testing. I don't think we are at that moment yea okay, so uh but that is something very mind in case this becomes the recurrent factor. [unintelligible] Okay so we will leave it about that for now. okay I am going to leave back to some information about anaphylactic reactions just youed to read about it. I don't a panic, but just we youed to be aware what what the symptoms are, if those kind of things happen, get back to us, if you feeling worried, just have a low threshold to c having a check with that, sometimes the child is will you need to calm thing down.unintelligible] yeah sen okay we leave it to come back to if you have any further issues. Ikay Thks. I appreciatecttell Thk best Bye bye [unintellig]</s>
