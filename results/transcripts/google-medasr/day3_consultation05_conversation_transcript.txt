There is some uh some inflammation going on there and there is some imbalances in the crystals that are in middle ear Okay, so what the most important treatment is actually giving you some kind of middilely yesterday so that you won' feel as if or going around in a bullet kind of feeling. Okay so that we need to [unintellible because you actually make you able to function a bit mobile stop you on ct medications. I would still like you to be seen by one of our doctors to take look inside areas to just make sure so this is like just symptomatic relief like therapy but we just get parasal suge to you know make you able to comment and see one of the doctors and things like that When while you with the doctors, we would like to do your blood pressure just examine you you know you know how you are walking and everything is. {paragraph} While we are waiting while waiting on seeing the doctor that if you develop any weakness of the legs or arms or or you know a sudden headache, any of those symptoms or you sto being violently sick with it, then you know you would need to take you back to a me [unintelligible] but if not wait for the appointment will p the doctor to examine you uh and we will take it from there. So I will send a prescription across your pharmacy looks like it is belowy pharmacyu system is accur so we will send you across that prescription. Uh it called quitil yeah it is one tablet three times a day, so I will give for about 10 days, but in the interim obviously in the next few days, you will get to see one of my doctors and we will have to take it from that. Okay thank you. O questions at all, uhm canun you need to take those tablets with food or can you just take them many time. It doesn't really not that you can take it because sometimes you may get the symptoms as soon as you wake up so probably mo feel a bit sick to eat and might as well just take the tablets.
