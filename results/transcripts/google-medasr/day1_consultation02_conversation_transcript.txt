I tried a few things like It like a steroid cream at the pharmacy last night, but it apparently didn't help because it did itunintelligible] toda Okay uh yeah give the name with the creamy boot uh steroid cream okay steroid okay. uh uhm do would you say the symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different u it is much more like itchy and eczema was more like in the arm, the no its also on the chest and in the and on the hand as wellpriintance hiking during the weekend and Im I cann't redo it anymore because it is like very like like I wanted to that last weekend and was super painful and I I have to take like showers every day to be able to kind of ease his itching bts which is very very annoy. mentioned itchiness and also mention it has been quite sore. Uh he have he noticed any bleeding or discharge from his skins. U no uhible] other uh pus or blood coming to skin you mention started three days ago. [PatientName] [unintelligible] ago you of any triggers anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to stop. So example have you change your shower gel, any clothing because I am thinking about [unintelligible] because I haven't and I don't understand that. I am kind of uh afraid of asking people around me because it iss cann of you know I don't feel really comfortable asking about this questions, cantate no okay that's okay. Uhm fine so just resummarized for the last four days you had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, manu your chest. I arms and legs as well and okay [unintelligible] any other symptoms if you notice ple on you not any temperature or fevers no [unintelligible] it itching nothing else okay. S your bowels are waking okay. You chest is okay. No cough, no breathing difficulties, no you are passing urine okay.Uh I think okay [uninrible] uhmuninellunintellible I mean do you have any ideas that what could be causing your symptoms anyone's any ideas that to what could be causing your symptoms And so I had thezema before, so maybe it this but it seems like more uh like myema was only on the arm, so I'm I am not sure I I re [unintelligible okay okay so normal at this I would like to examine you uhm to see the rash itself to see exactly what type of rash is. butefore what you told me you mentioned it you got some dry skin and some cracked skin as well uh and it has been very itchy and so withd youw uh your background of eczema uh sorry so couple of questions what [unintelligible]le my apologiesUh apst the eczemaun have any other medical problems should bewe uh no I just had asthma in the past but okay no anymore okay and do you take any regular medicationsh allergies uh no okay uhm and tell me about youruh your situation her who you live with. Uh so I live with a few flatmds Im so you I a31 h I a full-done job and so am withat work say moneyky which do for work. Uh I worked at a pharmaceutic company, so it has been it has been a few years now uh it is it is kind of interesting we working [unintelligible] U coule ques symptoms onk young I to say the sound quality is not uh great I will continue because we come this far. Uh so uh based on everything you mentions, I I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema uh the reason being that you said it is quite itchy uh it is mainylyffecting your chest and your back uh and uh having looked at your skin, uh the rash does appear quite familiar. Uh you mentioned you using steroid creams yesterday uh from the pharmacy. I wonder whether giving a stronger prescription of a of a steroid may be beneficial uh which I am have to prescribe to you today as well as I am going to give some some emolients which helps to moisturize the skin. Uh [unintelligible] using the barth and shower and it is deting worth uh using that for the first seven to 10 days uh before we make a decision on whether it is working or not. Uh it is also worth uh using antihistamines which can sometimes buy over-the-counter things like loratadine or Critin which can help with itchiness of the skin and it is also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting her symptoms anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap because if that is causing symptoms, we need to have a discussion about CA. Okay just I have tried antistamines uh lately butantuninellig you can different type [unintelligibles can give you something little bit stronger today as well uh something like fexofenadine which I can give to you today [unintelligible] tring is not going to harm uh but I say think using the steroids and the emolients on a regular basis uh over the next week to 10 days should hopefully control your symptoms, but do come back to see me next week if things don't get better. [unintelligelligible you have any questions could me and not that's itokay what I w you the best. Thank you very much. Okay have a good day.e</s>
