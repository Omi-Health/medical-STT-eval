Uh we with cct majorig already uh but will make sure not missing anything else. Uhm hu ha of chest, hard of breathing, uhm I short of breath or I not have any problems or funny heartbeats or rhythms, palpitations, [unintelligible] any headaches, any problems e vision. okayunintelligible]. Uhm fine okay uhm so really just moving on uhm so bas- based on new story really came its it is it is difficult its its we know [unintelligible pa.ctly know what is causing it could be a few different things like it causing your pain, could just be [unintelligible] could be a urine infection, presample could just be some related to guts uhm could this be something related to your you know pregnancy related to cause uhm and is probably were doing some tests initially to try to rule out uhm what is playing on here uhm which like can organize f today. Uhm and the based on those tests, we will have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed, but certainly if if if it has been going on for last couple of days uh uh you know it is probably maybe worth empirically treating it for maybe urin infection [unintelligibleible C that instead of me uh I think it is certainly worth you know covering you with some antibiotics today, uh but still wanting to bear mind you know having a pregnancy test done to make sure we are not missing anything else here and uhm Im going to really come back to see him in a few days' time if symptoms are not getting any better or indeed be getting worse So things look for be no worsening tummy pain uh make he feeling re hot or sweatsy with the temperature is not coming down, uhm vomiting etctera some make sense. h he can try just regular panckais pa will be advisable uhm make sure he drink plenty of fluids. He can try some cranberry juice as well which can something help with your urine symptoms. Uhm takeV antibiotics and give if worri anything else. Uhunintell sc Thank you very much. Uhm so just cect the script at pharmacy [unintelligible] pharmacy antbiotics today, somethingible trimethoprim uh will take two tablets uh one tablet twice a day for three days.</s>
