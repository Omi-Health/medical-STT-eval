S a couple of things I I think I may have overdone my workouts and now my knees are hurting and they are clicking a lot and it is starting to worry me. Uhm I can't run very far uhm anymore without just feeling pain in my knees and then sometimes I also get this weird tingling in my toes. Uhm so yeah thats that's it. I am just concerned the I figured you know {colon} See if you can help me figure out what is going on.'s fine so when think it stat so probably it's been about two weeks okay and and any joint problems thatYou know not not really I mean I play a lot of sports uhm and I had like I placed an ice cockee and I had this injury a few months ago.You know just fell on the ice and and you know had a huw bruise, but I think that's about it. kay say Im at the moment just tell me about the ex size that you are diving normally. So I am training well I am currently training for a marathon uhm it is going to happen in June and so I am trying to run like I mean right now, I am actually not even doing such long runs maybe like 7 or 8 miles and so I started about u maybe a month ago. uh I un like you know 4 5 miles and I have just done like a couple of seven mile runs and then uh and then you know I go to the gym like two times a week and kind of do my usual routine uhm but yeah I think the only thing that is really different has have been the runs the longer runs and have he had any times when the knie feels like it is giving way underneath you.reelligible] so it mes if you you just of jok like give way feel unstable underneath you no not bad I mean it just kind of start hurting you know uhm and did half far into the run did it generally had. You know I say it probably starts like after uh maybe 20 minutes or so, which is probably I don't know like somewhere around mile mayb miles and andt running run through the pain yeah that is a good corction. so uhm you know the last few times, the last time actually stopped I mean it ran a little bit longer, but then I stopped because it was uh I I feel like it is getting worse and uhm and when I started doing my abs that you know when I do my abs, it kind of requir me to move my you know uhm to kind of go from the flexed position of my knees and straighten my legs, then I hear all this clicking. I can I think that's also frequly out and then I just [unintelligible]un so it's more uhm it is actually my right that hurts. I'm any from to do left one so you know I feel it it is kind of weird, I feel it is a mittle, but I feel like maybe kind of a uh moves to the right to the right of my knee a little bit. Okay. I do notice any tenderness when he presses or the areas in the knee. So yes its I have probably some fluid I gool that and you know it says that sometimes if fluid accumulates. Okay do it look swollen to sorry the knee looks swollen. Uhm well it did like the first time I ran it was a little bit swollen, but then I just put some like ice on it and it went away, uhm but right now right now it is not swollen and right now it doesn't hurt you know uhm but it just kind of comes on when h uh or you know right now when I flex and extend my leg, it there is no clicking, but I willll notice it in the gym and then you know when I run it will start hurting okay and if you was sitting still for a while do you have any problems when you stand up any locking up with the knee, no concstrat ne, any problems getting up and downstairs, no any problems just walking normally no no [unintelligible] and inmth of range of movement, you able to fully straight in the neck yes and what about fully flex it yes okay A you taking any medication for the knee. Well, uhm since are asking uh yes I I take ibuprofen uhm and I will just kind to use it sometime like uh uhm like sometimes I have some joint issues, but you know that kind of is not very frequent, so I will take ibuprofen for that, but you know nothing like major maybe like 400 mg max something like that. I also sometimes will uh you known smoke a joint uhm and yeah other than that that's it okay and any other joint problems that you are getting, any bone pain, sooth swelling of your hands, feet, elbows, wrists, anyke pain. Uh while I have sometimes you know have sometimes like if you stand for a long time, your feet will kind or your legs will swell up. I can notice it because of my socks, I will just kind of noticed thisdation and then another weird thing I felt this just once, but there was this tingling in my toes like uh uh after the run. There was tingling in my toes like on my you know my right toes. Uhm so a new right [unin guess any change in color or temperature your lower legs No any swelling which stays if you push in then you release that stays that. W I don't know if could really try that, but I I will tell you that what I notice is like if I you know whenm the socks come off I kind of noticed that indentation a little bit Iy to not like major right but I I mean you mean I just need to like press and see what happens if it like kind of stays oryah and or any pain in the back of the calf or anything that no no nothing like that no and and would you said going back to normal now you feel any O2 sensation, tingling, numbness and min that No it was just it was that time uh but it was just really weird because it kind of went on for a while okay and any pain in the joints of the foot or on on the on side and the arch, any problems walking around on hot flowth. No okay had he had any other medical problems before. uh while I hadu you know just kind of your garden variety stuff right cold and uh I mean I I do have unfarcided and so I had uh I had LASIK surgery and then once I had this really bad UTI, they thought it was kidney stones and so they had me actually ER and if my GP did not call them tell them that you know they don nott need to give me morphine uhm that was kind of an off experience, but uh other than that, you know I'm I'm I am pretty good okay do take any other medication told me that W I will take uh I take vitamin D, uh I take melatonin. Sometimes you know it just for cramps, I will take likeu uhm ibuprofen or actually acetam- uh I will take what I am might taking Aleve whatever I leave is. I think that maybe uh acetaminophen or I can't remember or poross of drugs.You occasionally I am really having hard times like how uh sleeping, I will take Xanax, uhm but I prefer melatonin just sometimes melatonin doesn't work Okay and any problems to his stomach or asthma, indigestionunintell no problems and what I would suggest is definitely carrying on with ice therapy that he has been using so as much as you can because that really does not make a difference to injuries. [unintelligible] healing blood into the area and gives it the best chance if getting better so as much as he can use ice. Uhm y will trying to stick to American Program but uh I would try either on the running if you can and if it if it is painful enough having to start running then it is no longer idea to do that. Uhm it is fine to take the ibuprofen and I can prescribe the slight stronger antiinflammatory he can take regularly instead of the ibuprofen but not with the ibuprofen but [unintellig with food. Uhm ultimately, we probably need to examine the knee and so the best thing I would suggest getting an appointment with the physiotherapist first you can do like a long assessment and examination of the knee and then per make an assessment as to whether we need to do any uhm imagejor to have to look inside the knee and see if there is any problem with the cartilage. Well you know I wt I ret stop on mind that that may be like my ligaments, there is I think it iss like ACL or or something like that right and so if that I mean I am kind of like breakdow it then may break, so do think it's that or uhm it it is not really possible to diagnose that over the sor over the Fidea, so we definitely would needun. Uhm thefidia is the best point of call because that probably been more at initial treatment, but the appointment times to long to wait then we can see we can see [unintelligible] well. Can you sorry go stand referral for that yeah and we can [unintell that. If in the meantime he develops like persistent swelling, heat, redness uhm at the knee or high temture feel un well or it completely looks up you cal and and stretch it you need call us back in that [int Thk you yeah please sure I mean give me the stronger meds and I will give that</s>
