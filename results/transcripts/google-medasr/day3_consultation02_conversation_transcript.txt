We are okay so I am staly having headache that correct uh yea about uhm asun bad severe headache past four days uhm andu been so feeling b hot as well. Uh go got over her temperature I think I haven't measured it but uhun I got fever. and uhm [unintelligible] or Uh so uh headaches startedu first uh and thene so I have had some parastal and some ibuprofen but it is not really helping at moment. Okay so just my questions heade so do find it difficult to look at the light. Uh no mo- uh lo uh [unintelligible] see okay and he had any pain when he tried to move your neck from side to sideint up down hainig pain uh go so general aching muscles uh not necessary so in my neck kind of and you beentellig and do you have a cough Uh no no cough. Oka so there is no cough or coldah okay and you ears are okay. There is no earaches. Uh no it it seems be ay kayr and with this headache have you experienced any pins and needles in bo face, arms, and legs. Uh no any muscle weakness at all uh just general aching aching not not any weakness but you couldn't you know hold a cuff or anything like that that is what I mean uh no so k and uhm just a few more questions because I don't have any of your background history. uhm do you suffer from any medical conditions Uh no uhm general medical history is gone fine and no surgical history that and no medical or surgical complaints yet uh nom I I spo  I have been away to uhm uh Tyn uhmu so a week or so ago. Uhm had some like- usual mosquito bites from so traveling around u friend of mine has also been a bit unwell but uh uh Uh I uhm uh I do feel cold quite a lot that he are using at ho uh no okay. Uhm any allergies at all. Uh no uhmalright okay and okay souh I I believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine  yeah uh it it is notu po possible for us to do that online. I think he would need to come into one of our housebs to have a proper examination andu I think he would need one quite urgently. In case so theuninig running in the back of my mind uh kind of viral illnesses that can one can get with soto mosquito b or foreign travel. like the crea. Uhm the the other common thing around tiland will be like some dangue but that would have like you would have some uh blood spots or bliing on something which you don not have at the moment to you. Uh no rash but nothing like. Uh no no bleeding. would you describe thesh uh uh so red and itchy and and itchy so if you put a glass on top of the rash just that rash go away uh yeah it goes away okay. Okay souh what we need to do need to urgently examine you and that sometimes today oka and u after our examination, there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital, but I am not sure as yet, so I would like you to be seen to one of the hobs as soon as possible. Uh I will write night note see and recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor preferably in the next few hours' time okay and in any case if that is not available, I unlike you to take ca to AN or I any questions at uh no I am sorry]. Its you know obviouslyn sp contin you didn't take the box for many series, but you are in the middle somewbody lets put it that way. [unintelligible if you you you know think like we have to rule out his meningitis and  but the you just have a general muscle ache, You did not say that you have things like you had problems looking at light or something It goes out things when you think of meningitis, but and then it is the uh in meningitis you get a nonblanching ra rash while in any kind ofvirus it view of the rash usually goeska saying that we do not know whether these are the beginning stage. so that is for a rather but I would rather  see a JP as soon as possible if we ths awailable, but if not I think he needs to be see and maybe have some blood t andunintelligible]</s>
