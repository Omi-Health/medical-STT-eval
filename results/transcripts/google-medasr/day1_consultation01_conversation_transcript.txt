some uh diarrhea for the last three days uhm and it has been affecting me I need to stay close to the toilet and yeah it has been affecting my day-to-day activities. sory [unintelligible uhm when youarrhea [unintelligible] diarrhea give me you [unelligible toet more often or your stools more loose.Y so it is like loose and watery stool going to the toilet quite often uh and like some pain in my like lower stomach and how many times a day are you the last couple of days probably like six seven times a watery lower abdomen so like uh just one side cramp a muscular cramp and uh bit weak and shaky pain there all the time comes and goesible just mainly my stoqui wea [unintelligible] does not feel like had a feveruh at the moment, but I did notice a temperature when the symptoms started so uh around about three or four days agoYa I did mention my temperature but I felt uhm just a bit hot sweing and so uhm I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now I have stopped vomiting just normal food color vomit and noo [unintelligible] and any ymptoms [unintelligible] mention the tummy pain you mention diarrhea, you mention vomiting and anything else that comes to mond. Uhm I had a loss of appetite, uhm I haven nott been eating as much, uh but I have been able tohold down fluids. Okay drinking fluids wal on the foods if you managed to eat anything. arge just soups and uyah like foods likemedies and yeah liquid foods mainly ka fi Uhm and so uh uh the started three days ago his symptoms you have anyy triggers which may have caused the symptoms to kickot things like take away foods or eating out or beating around other people with similar symptoms. Yeah so I had take away about four days ago uhm uh but other than that you have been eating normal Che. Uhm so no one else in the family  wife and two kids and one uhm child was vomiting, but they have not got diarrhea, that is no one with the same symptoms. Ok ay Uhm rightright and in terms of your your overall health you know you feeling well I mean other than uh asthmahaler every control and you don't have any other tummy problem bowel problem thatw nok Uhm and to p inhalers do take any other medications uh no no other medications In terms just [unintelligible] ne to staylosqui frequently during past three days [unintelligible other than thatcn say you mention you live with his wife and two childrenr, yes yeah alright Uhm just couple question you need alsou smoke ho uh no I don't smokein way alcohol uh no I I don't drink alcohol S [un ex but I think uh just rec for last three days he has been having loose stool, diarrhea, bit of tummy pain mainly in the left hand side uhu vomiting and feeling getting quite weak and lethargic. Uhm you mentioned you ha this  Chiny nick way as well as three days ago and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. Okay it seems like he may have something uh called gastroenteritis which essentially tummy bug or infection of of the tummy uh mainly caused by viruuses, but it can be uh possibility of bacteria uh causing symptoms. att this stage, uh what what would recommend is just what we say conservative management, so I don't think you needing feel antibiotics. It is really just making sure you are well hydrated with drinking fluids. Uhm uh there are things like Dirid you can get from the pharmacy which it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. okay uh and if you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would see recommend you know first couple of days. [Yinaigible] if feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamal uh [uninell few tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. Al certainly [unintelligible] [unintelligible work uhm would say in next two two to three days uhm can clear your system takes some time rest. Uhm if your symptoms haven't got better you know in in three to four days, I would like to come back and see me again. I su because if it is ongoing and we have to wonder whether there is something else callused his symptoms uh and we may need to do further [unintelligible] taking [unintelligible] stool so we can test that uh etcetera etce.a [unintelluninigqu question</s>
