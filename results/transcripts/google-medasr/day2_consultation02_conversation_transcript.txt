intellible]ment you [unintelligible] I just noticed this like about a week ago something uh swelling on on on my elbow. I noticed that when I was in the shower, uh it's not painful at all or I u a I feelt fine, but it just it just a bit a bit well to see that uh but it it slightly warm uhm and I I cannot feel like this it should be fluid in inside uhunt so I U not that I know if I haven't noticed anything. I can actually like it normally uh it just I I can just see thatunell okay and uh in terms of your jawory of of see this I don't remmber oay uh and cannouunj any family got any kind of rheumatology diseases rheumatoid arthritis or lupus anything likeig Uhm no well I I do well, I think I think I have something like osteoarthritis, uhm uh uh it sometimes kind of helps uh my joints, but uh in my family, I am not sure O no no sure so you you osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that have you ever seen a doctor who has confirmed that and told you about osteoarthritis. Uhm yes yes few years ago okay was GP or specialist or physiotherapy uh Uh allergic to peanuts not thatunagno sh uh and uh do you uh you on any medication on a regular basis uh no no okay and you normal only fiting well mobile activity. I do I do do some sts I run regularly like two to three times a week. Uhm no I think I'm helpinginell] on regular basis okay uhm and uhm uh possibleintigible now.tigible Oky with me one second right okay and if you can just raise you up and just bit that the highest I can just say the unders okay con  and then just bring it ar to this siteunentibleested alright and if you can just touch the tip of the elbow with your fingers there is a is is it hot compared to the surrounding skin the adjacent skin. It a bit is a bit warm okay uhm and is it very tender when we presses on that [un usual. On the on the tip of the elbow, it is ocay just like mixed we like wther the swelling is a bitunintellig] Oka Uhm uhm I noticed the skin was a bit dry dry skin anywhe  [unintelligibleky so uhm what I think we should do with regards to elbow proble is uh I think it would be worthwhile. It this seems likeu what be called the bursitis okay so there is an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. Uhm what I think we should do is I think he should be on some anti-inflammatory medication in the first instance and as well as that what I would like to do is to get some blood test done to check her other types of uh causes of joint swelling. Okay so uhm what we are going to do is we are going to arrange some uh blood test forms to be sent out to house and there will be instructions within that pack about where to go to get the blood test done and that will involve you uhm having the test done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies, so we will do a full screen and also check things like gout as well. the timeframe for that will be uhm the results will come back to us after about five to six days uhunintelligible out to you and you getfor test on straight away by the time that we are expecting result back in one or two days after that we we looking at it may bee six days and what I would suggest is we can arrange a followup appointment for you one about c where we can have a look at your joint feel that. wee can review the blood tests and we can uh get engage as to uh what is going on. Now in terms of you joint right now it does not look like to me likeunintelligible excuse me septic arthritis. So we are worry sometimes that someone might have been acute the infected joint uh and your youral joint does not look like that.However, if your the elbow was become very red, very painful uh and the redness was just spread or become you know more intense, The need to get on the phone will have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible because I admit emergency that would require more immediate assessment more immediate treatment. Okay do think it is something deerous like something like [MedCenterName] can could I diate I don' think this is daous this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward, nothing sinister or lifethreatening. Uh what I am doing is I'm just say in case thing go and these are things that would be looking out for I do't know we have to do but you don't have that now thankful and I don't think you going to have it, but I'm just saying they w chip scenario It is okay.e that [unintelligiblek. you have any questions that Uh know  [unintelligible] Uh the end of that's it. Thank you. Okay so I I would take ibuprofen regularly. Okay you can get that over-the-counter uhm that's 400 mg two times a day and you should take take that off after food not an empty stomach iff you get any help and stop taking it. Ookay [unintelligible] Aalr so what I want to do I get the form sent up to you and uh we are going to arrange a followup appointment maybe within a uh actual you know the followup appointment does have to be face to face. If this is more commun to do over the phone we can done [unintelligible] can that will call but you contact us of after the blood test done or we can review things kay. [untelligible I will do that if I see that it get call appointmentalr okay and take you the so just leave that with me also this pieces out we will get it se out to you and then we we will uh review you after the test.anee.</s>
