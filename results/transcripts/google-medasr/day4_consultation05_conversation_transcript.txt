uh I am I was born on the first of Jany of uhm uh 19:92 okay and even a space thats squant and you able to do oh sorry uh uhmr sayYes so I have I have I don't know how you say properly in English uh I mean [Ca yeah so it is lasting for like three days and yeah I I do not know I do not know what could cause itu uh uh I have a bit of pain abdominal pain and I had a bit of vomiting on uh yeah but this are kind of like the what is happening to me. Okay tell me how you were three days ago before that started.Did you have any medical problems. Uh so I have I have I have asthma and I take some some uh inhaler I don't know uh I take an inhaler uh and uh I have an allergy. I have  NK NKDA allergy. okay I don't know if is because I don't know [unintelligible] and apart from as not you have anything else, uh I don't know maybe because you know it thing herar in the stomach staff like I always have in the back of my head and my father because he died abouth 10 years ago orunell cancer so yeah this is kind ofuuh my my worries I don't know itkay so you you had the diarrhea for three days and now you have abal pain and vomiting yes yes A once the diarrhea been getting better or less Uh uh I I think it is not getting better or worse. It is kind of like uh uh like e like normaltellig like it it hasn't gone away, it hasn' worsened and how often she goes the toilet. I go I need to go I I can't go to work because I need to go like every I don't know if this feeling like I go to the toilet and then when I finish I need to It I need to go again a drink uh I thinkh I don't knowink O important question have you noticed any blood uh no I have' not and you mentioned tummy pain, tell me more like a tummy pain like where it is and if it goes anyon souh the pain is mainly uh ocsing in the center area of the abdomen like under the belah and sometimes I can hear my stomach Uh yes ba- yes but I I got to toilet soten so I yeah tred not 10nut and there and it toeviated beunintl it this, but okay and when was the last time you vomited. I think it was this morning this morning I but they thinks like because I am not eating anything up, so I I haven't vomited again. D you have any breakfast, so I don't know [Other Ith because of nausea and I vomited and then [unintelligible] [unell I'm okay but [unintelligible] notic any blood upon vomit. uhm I think I do I think I do, but this no no actually I cant sorry I am sorry right I I don't think there is blood because yeah it was it was strawberry I was having for breakfast so so yeah was blood and uh did you eat anything that you think much have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain. Uh I I don't know to be on it sometimes I have when I get the bit of anxiety, I I used my inhaler ye u but my inhaler kind of uh ran out the one because she want a Forne, so I have [unintelligible] but I got the new one here that it and uh I don' know maybe this new one has caused itunig Okay it is very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like thisly it is when you eat uh bad food or food that has gone offu and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested, but just double check,Ha you noticed any problems with your breathing. Uh uhu I always have problems with my breathing because of the asthma like when I [unintelligible I need to use my inhaler [unintellible] but normal I have' I have okay andunintdig] chest have you noticed any chest pain no have't I haven't noticed any chest pain okay and held about and walking and talking there is okay on does anyintellible ay soorry I was just writing some things down So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it is causing your tummy painu and it is no- this is normally called gastroenteritis so an infection of the tummy. Of normally when patient have this do f things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids are losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers, so if you start getting a temperature, then you needpeatable. and we stay home for the time being until he get slightly better Ookay and normally I normally things like antibiotics don't help they make the situ have any fever recently. I waseating a little bit but I am not sure a of fe but but I don't think so I don't think I don't marry so I think that what we should do for the time being. If you feel you are getting much less, then I would suggest you COGP in real in realline impasson,h will the wait a couple of days to see or one day and then will any question me Uh no that's that's it. I was maybe just concerned about high father's u medical history that would yeah some kind ofuninell] so the the things that you told me are mo suggestive of an infection of your tumy and less likely to be something your father has, but o if things don' get worse, the something that we can look up from the GPunintelligible Thank you very much look [unintelligible] Be</s>
