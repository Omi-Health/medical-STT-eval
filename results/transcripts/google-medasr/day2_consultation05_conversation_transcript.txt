Uh the pins and needles are in the hand, but I feel like my arm is getting weaker, but only last few days and then goes back to normal it is very weird righttelligible] and any involvement of your leg so uh my colleague said I am walking slightly differently to normal and again it turn only for three day or three or four days. Okay he said has been having symptoms for about a month ye whatpp being [unintelligibleUh generally, he feel tired and weak and sometimes I feel nauseous and I don't feel like I want to do anything [unintelligible Uhm and uhm knowunintelligible not been walking normally ye do you feel anything different on either side in terms of your legs? C you have you notic any diff. Yes so at the same time I get my arm symptoms, my leg feels weaker right okay and [unintelligible] abnormal gaitunintelligible present outside of these episodes. No it has not sorry not am fiting well actuallyuninig okay uhm and these these episodes how often have they been happening. They have been getting more regular S about the start it would be maybe once a week uh to every once once a month, but now it's getting uh a couple of times a day right okay and how long these episodes has have been going on for [ununintelligible] [unintelligible] half maybe two months right okay okay and along with these symptoms uh of the weakness and numbness, do you have any other symptoms at the same time like swallowing or difficulty speaking or vision problems. So recently I have noticed I can't hold my cup of coffee and when I do drink coffee, it is slightly harder to drink and that' has only been in the last couple of days I guessight is that during these episodes or outside of these episodes only during the episode okay Do you have any difficulty swallowing no currently no during the episodes, you have any difficulty swallowing.Uh I I feel like there is something in my throatkay what aboutu uhm difficulty speaking during these episodes and any issues with that or that I can speak by [ther and any visual problems during these episodes. I do'tunigible weight loss is okay [unintelligible] no uhm cannot just has uh is there any history of stroke or mini strokes in the family, Uh yes, my father has had a operation to the side of his neck to reduce the risk of stroke right okay uhm and uh however yoursel has had any history of mini-strokes or anything like thattibleng No so after my dad had his operation, I was required to be checked and my cholesterol was fine {period} [unintelligible] So you had a blood test done and [unintelligible] diabetes as well. They checked my diabetes, my blood pressure, and my cholesterol and the doctor said it was all okay [unintelligibleing okay. No do you have any other illnesses at to no no you on any medication. I take an aspirin 75 mg once a day but thats because of something I read on the inne Okay so so why is that [unintelligible that I think it's meant to reduce your risk of stroke and heart attack. Okay have you [uninelligible] before your GB that you on aspirin. guess I took I started taking it after my father had this operation, but that was not't the doctor telling me okay uh and has any GP ever spoken to you about the risks of aspirin but you should be on that orok Uh alright uhm now uhm in terms of your uh you can social situation,um you working at the moment ye I am would you work uh I'm I'm actually a doctor you me- uh a medical doctor yeas okay uh which specialy you in plastic surgery [unintelligible]telligible] and uhm do you have any uh allergies to any medication at all I am allergic to penicillin only okay and uhm you uhm living alone, no I live with my wife, [FamilyMemberName] okay uhmt it. Uh do you smoke no I didn't okay uhm that's fine. No [unintelligible] meic yourself. did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on? abible] okay. Uhm while the way you are describing these episodes, they made me concerned about mini strokes or TIA trans- transient ischemic attacks uhm and so that iss only quite urgent and given that you got a family history of uhm stroke uh even though you are quite young, I think uh is something we need to exclud. So what I am proly going to do and what I am going to do is I am going to refer you to a stroke TIA clinic. Uhm just dointelligheck. do you have the symptoms w now No I am perfectly fine at the moment okay so so whatuninasig I am going to refer you to a a mini stroke clinic or TIA clinic. Uhm I said that referred off now and then you can attend them that they usually call you in within the next one to two days okay because it something res the now. Today it is Wednesday, so we few days before the weekend, soo uhm uh basically the deadline should be Thursday, Friday. We are expecting to be seen by that time that is to kind of turn ar looking and in that clinic, they will be doing a number of things. Uhm they will be checking that will be doing the ultrasound of the carotid arteries like your father has uhm and they will be doing maybe they might do a scan of the brain as well to sh if there any signs of a bleed there, but uhm they will be do a range of tests in the stroke time frame in order to exclude whether you have uhm any illness.ke have got any kind of  storoke or ministrate. Now if your symptoms returnpersyst that prolonged, then uhm you may need to attend AME okay becauseu our presumptive working diagnosis is minisstroke or TIA okay and if administerke is prolonged then uh then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke and in that case that becomes even more an emergency. So we are not talking about waiting one or two days. We w goanceon possible.a if things happen again feel free to contact us we cansess you over phone dire g Oa so uhm this is the plan going forward. Uh I am going to uh do that referral.hould heve back in the hospital relatively soon. the hospital you can actually ring them on uh uh the PLigible number and then there is also the clinic number. I am with that number in the notes for this consultation. Okay so you have all the information you need to change this appointment and uh if you want you can bring them either today or tomorrow morning to today in the afternoon wait at one to two hours or tomorrow just to find out one day of time to sort you in and just to make sure they p you the system this is uh an immediatemer but is something quite urgent we need to deal with in a short spate okay, so if there is if there is any delay that transpes for example, you can make the appointment or you they you can get callund get getting contact back back with us okay you have any questions [unintelligible] ky so just be with me few minutes and then I will send that uh all through and then you should uh we should be able to have ye of the information youhanceokay corre Thank you.
