Hunintelligible]tness of breath you noticed any el. Uhm uhm yeah I did did uhmuninther than I had a C-section a few weeks ag and how long was just a few weeks [unintelligible] you noticed shortness of breath for just an hour while itting T and you had your C-section a couple of weeks ago and yesterday you noticed a cough. so talked to me about you  with flu symptm Uhunintelligible] [untelligible] and this shortness of breath you are having if getting worse. Uhm no I mean I don't I feel like I a'm getting ready stressed out because like my rey getting okay and the shortness of breath do Uhm I meanh my [unintelligible]seuninell [unintelligible] to take any medications. Uh justk Ub haven' taken it for a weekokay and apart from the C-section and this shortness of breath have youunintigible other medical problems I should about. Uhmnet [intelligible I'm allergic toibupro okay and what happens when you take iburofen need fora you measur it recently e might need to do that over the phone so are able to put your right hand on your left wrist just underneath your thumb I co to three come down from three just co the number of beats you have noticed and willh so we will start in three to one go that should be enough [unintelligibleuninelligible] So your heart is running slightly fast at the moment which is proably because of your shortness of breath and some of the pain that you under. Oka given that you had a C-section and your short of breath which has come on quite recently and quite quickly, it might be worth you going into the hospital to get checked out a bit further so there is two ways of us during this. The first is I can call an ambulance or you can take yourself to the hospital with baby [unintelligible] which would you prefer it feels a bit traumatic to call an ambulance Uhm I I will I will get and what I would suggest is go fairly quickly and take some bicks for baby at the same time Oka and if you were taking any medications like codeine, don't don't take them for the time being. [unintell is anyone else with you at home I name my part ay so I think that is the best thing to do for the time being.unintellig so what I am worried about the moment is given that you have the C-section, some people can suffle with clots and this can either be found in the legs or your chest, so in your lungs. Yah it is going a common thing to happen and it is not something to worry about but needs to be checked up in the hospital first and if it if that does become the case Thank you much. thank you.</s>
