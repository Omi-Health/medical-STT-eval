intelligible] con your name and  age please.Yess it untelligible W have this like really crazy headache that has been going on for a few days and it headache. uh around three days ago mayb pain. Uh it is basically like it kind of feels all over my head but like mainlyh around my right eye [unintelligible and is a headache there all the time it is it come and go. Uh its it kind of comes and goes uh but I mean is there all the time, but le sometimes strongerellaing a scale of one1 to 10 h can be the worst type of pain you ever had, how you rate this headache. It is probably eight [unintelltelligible] describe the headache to me uh in terms of the nature of the pain is sharp, it is dull, is a crampy, is throbbing and it is kind of it is dull, but sometimes it gets a bit sharper, so basically it like it developed gradually. I guess, it is like the first day it just started when I was at work and by the end of the day it was like pretty pretty like it was a lot basically and then I was thinking okay, maybe I will just go to sleepu and I woke up the next morning like it was even even moreunintell] using the headache is getting worse in the last three days.Yah okayH you tried anything which made the headache better. Uh so I tried ibuprofen, uh so it took like a few uh for the last two days basicallyuntellig] it does not really help no and in the past it did help me which is why I decided to try [unintelligible] except the headaches any other symptoms as.vision not really but just when it started, I I got this like weird cooting lights and like now like light is quite loss of vision or blurry vision. No loss of vision I just like some lights from  shooting lights [un any nausea or any vomiting. Uhm one like basically I I am sick with the headache but I no vomiting [unintelligible] voiting a any neck pain or neck stiffness, no okay any difficulty with speaking or uhm speech. No any difficulty w with weakness in the arms and legs. No it is hard to focus though so I had to take a couple of days off work actuallytell later on. Uh but usually after I I take ibuprofen it is kind of goes away, so but this time it is just not Uhm any temperatures or fevers, no rashes kin noed [unintelligible]t I think are just headache and history of migraineol. No myself I have never had a migraine, but my sister and my mom have them uh quite frequently [unintelligible unintellible just second beforeing further cano you take any regular medication a nor unellig pill no okay give allergies to medications [unintelligible]unintell mother and sister both have migraines they normally well controlled or they having difficulty controlling the symptoms. my sister like better like it kind of is very rare, but my mom's is like quite bad uh usually when there is like a season changingstunintelligible] fa Uhm socially I so uh so was who lives at home with you. live with house ma, workig so worked with computer as a lot, so kind of is difficult to focus. I to likedce the brightness of have been wearing them since I was five z five year old [unintelligible] straining.U I always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Uhm we have been more stressed and anxious what recently. has been a bit stressful kicking off any projects, but u yeah nothing out of the ordinary reallyperiod Uhm regarding smoking or alcohol, did drink or smoke as. I socially smoke and I drink no only socially socially Okay Right now uh G idea causing those symptoms if you have you read anyth on orunintelligible] people uh not really uh I for first I thought it stress or maybe I did not drink enough water because sometimes when I don not drink enough water, I I get headaches uh uh but I don't think that's it and I am like worried it I don't want it to be a migraine because I know what it is like from my mom and my sister and it is really annoying, so I I really don't want to have that and know it is genetic, so I have researched that, uh but I don not know if that is the case, sot any partult. Yeah maybe just kind to if you have any recommendations [unintellible] I can take something stronger because apparently ibuprofen does not help me. Uh usually it gets resolved if I have headache and like after like one or two days, but currently it it did not help me [unintelligible] take ibuprofen uh three a day three a day okay [unintelligible] uhm so [unintelligible] uh really whath thing is going on here, un uh unfortunately I do think this could be a headache very similar to migraine, uhm the reason I say that because the history is very suggestive of given new mom andnew sister also migraines I think it is something for think about. Uhm now more say it is going to keep happening [unintelligible] one off but starting worth treating it today with some stronger analgesia or pain killers. Uhm now moving forward, we have some options which we can discuss. Uh you tried the ibuprofen, now my worry is I am not sure whether you are taking the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets three times a day. there is definite room for improvement there or I can prescribe this something stronger like naproxen which is another anti-inflammatory which can be helpful. Uh We can also add another pain killer like paracetamol or codeine, which might be helpful as well. Uhm yeah I think Cdine is what my mom takes for when she has uh uh migrainesun I think is it is any worthing I can give a prescription for that today. Uhm with regards to uhm the next few days, it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can fiy and work outwards if there are any triggers which could be causing her headaches become worse and you know like can come back and see me in about a week's time week to two weeks' time. If you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches, we can think about givingnew medications as prophylactic, which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis, but we can have a discussion next time.U okay okay. In the meantime, if your headaches arms getting any better or getting worse, uh you know want to give me a call or come back and see me sooner problems vision, no weakness in your arms and legs or just not feeling very well, just me a call and come back and see me</s>
