He said he said he had he has had something for a little while as well.intktellible drinking coffee you keeping it down you keeping your fluids down.

Uh so I uh yeah I think I think otherwiseu fit well I uh yeah I mean Im un okay wayit anduh I I don't think give any related medical history uh [unintelligible] yeah no I don't thinkunt you medications so I uhm no I mean I I've been taking some like parasetamal something like that lately, but I haven't been I am not on any regular medication or anything like that.ergies toation uhm so I don't have any allergies that I know h bowel with what bowel like this is the colon da actually has u colon cancer at from what I is kind of so I don' I didn't speak to him that often so I don't I don' know the exact details and I I don' exactly know the full things look like unintellig] cancer and [unintelligible but uh he is sort of in his third stage. Uh I am not sure what that means exactly. Uhm [unintelligible ye uh so yeah its it's uh he yeah you can I can see he is kind of weaker and it isffecting a lot and uhless [unintelligible] quite I I guess itunintelligible]tailallyt so uh not my brother. He does not live with me. Im I live with my uh sister and my mom and [ how thing [unintelligible]ging okayigtelligible] I mean uh I think uh has been it has been tricky uhm going work with all of this.

S I don't think it affed them and I haven't realady been I am realady gone into detail with [unintelligible about it uhm yeahu just rather doal with these things. Uh Uh so I walked it in I worked at uh an office uh inuninentellalible London uh [unintelligiblea copy last final cou couple question smoking and alcohol do you do either Do smoke or do drink [uninellig alcohol. I'm sor I I smoke uhm I smoke u uh for like socially but not like regularly. Uhm so normally if it is a Friday or something like that I might might have [unintelligible] something like that but uh [unintelligible sorry alcohol so alcohol uhm I you know I might have a a beer during the weekdays may uh not man it may bee uhm the mo for Fridays. I have more uhm alcohol uhm yeah p 51vel units uh on it I suppose not every week, but maybe uh once or twice a monthyah go out with my friends and drink a lot so that that yeah [unintelligible]pful so uhm go just as a uh conclusion uh uhm just rapid or up I think the symptoms are suggestive of something of gastroenteritis.kay basic infection of your tumy to worry about. Uh uhm uhu I suspect this will just settle down the next few days, just like a de brother make sure drink plenty of fluids okay and you can just drink like normal water, I just feel like every time Iunt just coming out unintelligible] but I am also worried about the fact you are losing minerals and vitamins u so you can get things likeDrelte which isu a fluid replacement which can get from the pharmacyend you can try just in a regular parasmor if you are be feverish, but if your symptoms are not settling down the next couple of days so 48 hours, I want to give you a callpack because you know if you are getting dehydrated, then we need to do further investigationskay I less see how you are in the next one to two daysokay and willunintchig oa kay so you say that I shouldep I will tr what do in foodunin.You soft diet, I think like soup mash and then gradually build up uh as much as the body can tolerateu but really less try and to keep usf well hydr first Okay okay makes it carry on having like uhm pa things like.Uh [unelligict tummy pain if you feeling feverish then nothing passes more is very sensible. Okay try avoid alcohol if you can Uhy [unintelligibletelligible]. thank you very much. Thks</s>
