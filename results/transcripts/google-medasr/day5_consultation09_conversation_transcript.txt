So that would involveunloo you getu get bacterial infection so thatun would do a test for well and if that comes positive no specific antibiotics that we would get you to treat it so it is definitely worth checking for but we would also check just start the thing and which can cause reduced energy tiredness and aching but persistent over six weeks. So you are happy to do that if you book that through the support line and then when you had the test arrange to followu that wek after had the test done okay sorry the tunin and that followu canunellunintelligible]k you</s>
