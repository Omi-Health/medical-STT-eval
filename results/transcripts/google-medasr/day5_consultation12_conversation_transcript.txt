Uhm I mean the fact that you have' had headaches before um is unusual in the fact that they developed is anything things change any increased stress, change in your diet or lifestyle Note that I can notig that I can think so what we would suggest is trying sight fromer pain relief and so similar to ibuprofen but taking instead of ibuprofen not at the same time and taking that regularly with food and hopefully that will settle it down. You can take parace to along with that. Try uh take rest have lots of good hydration uhm but if the pain is getting worse or you get new symptoms, fever, rash, vomit, neck stiffness and or you keep getting afterwards of the same type of thing, then we need to spe to and and make a plan for we can do next.inell Thank you any other questions. how long you think it will last for well I should think it should pull out. If it is getting worse or not seffening in the next day or two, then certainly give us a coolba when you [unintelligible] tri the medication from the pharmacy. right then Thks not. B byye bynd.</s>
