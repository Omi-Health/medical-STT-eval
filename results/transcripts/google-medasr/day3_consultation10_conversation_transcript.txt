tigible]2 three one leteron sorryy that correct and just to confirm that you are in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. okay I you mentioned on our notes that you is suffering from bar so about it if you tell me more about it please uh it has been happening for about three days now stated of uh I don't know it just something that I thought would go away pretty quickly. I have had that from time to time after eating certain types of food or going on certain travels, but uh nothing funky in my diet and no travels recently uhm and it just kind of kept up I am bit as to to. just a little bit yeah uht no I mean it it's pretty standard diarrhea where it like a little bit of abdominal pain. I threw up once [unintelligible  reperew up after that we said something uh nothing else is wor oka right and with the diarrhea how many times a day I you go into the toilet uh four to five four to five times yeah and is there any and it is like w it is like w or just loose uh 40 minute are you going like water or if it just in a bit bit so- solid stoooles with loose kind of thing. It probably depends on the time of day [unintelligible] and there any blood or mucus no blood or mucus. It like is not be stuff and the stool yeah it looks like it is not mi u yeah no mucus uh may bee a little bit, but it has not been bad in particular hasn not been too worry. Are he is still able to eat and drink u a little bit of appetite loss I guess vers the normal but also not something I would like if that was alone I would know sto} still able to drink ply [unintellig yet okay anything for the abdominal pain, h nothing yet kay what and any unfortunately we don not have any ofew past medical histories that anything you would like to say. Uh I probably uh had asthmaintellu I don' know I guess I still have it okay anda Uh my dad had hypertension hypertension [unintelligible] bowel cancer 10 years ag uh 62 okay and uh you mention you had asthma are you using an inhaler [unintellible yes which ones Lexapro sorry Lexapro Lexapro okay notunin of it make is itsalbutamal [untigibleay I w have to check thattdation are overthe-counter about four to five times a day. UhYou are still drinking plenty and you looked like you not dehydrated which is a good sign. Okay u then we start worrying about diarrheas if you are going more than eight times a day, that means probably you you know whatever you eating is going straight through. Okay, you still need to drink plenty of water because you are losing a lot of fluids. Okay when you go to the toilet, uh thinks that one would advise it a soft diet, so avoid dairy, fish, meats, eggshy you are having the diarrhea go sor a soft diet outside of not thing you by soft so that will be like crackers, toast jum. those kind of things that easily digestive.What what you could give babies yeah when they stop eating you give simple food for babies, you do not' give eggs or meat the first time we stop feedings. that is the kind of soft diet we are talking about yea. Oce you are able to you know keep most of it in, you can start off with some just b vegetables and mash. Once you are okay with that for about 48 hours, then you can stop having itat. So just don't have me [unintelligible] want you feel like you is slightly better because you might go back to sque one again. A okay with that di like once. O 48 hours you are not having any diarrhea. you fine, then you can go and start having meat eggt so get better but is not getting or want it to go away completely at that point like trending up preferably just down because why do you say is because it takes much more timeful me to get digested. soo because y gut flora, you know the the the bacteria and ygaut is not in or as it should be it takes a bit more effort for one to digest this food Whi it does not take back much of an effort to youodgest mash and vegetables, does not make sense.ellYah so uh at the same time you could have some you although you kind milk is not a good idea, yoga's are a good idea because they are probiotics, it helped to build up the normal uh ga- ga bacterium back. Okay so those can No things to look that for. If your diarrhea does not go away in a week's time or if you are passing blood, we need a stool sample. Because that mays you you may have some uh some particularbuts that might need treatment with antibiotics. Okay okay if you can again as have mentioned previously, you are going about six to eight times a day that means there is a high chance that you were having the dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time if that happens, you get in touch with us again or Okay anyn questions you look a bit confused.uninellig yea okay and also you could get something called Dirlyze overthe-counter, so it helps to u replenish the salts that you been that lost through going to the toilet if you are bit confused even you can actually all this is all recorded in youu so you can go back I will put that all in detail so if youintig sometimes it difficult to process everything, you can go back and re read the notes.</s>
