Next door. Hello. Hello. Hi. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, I can hear you. Hi. Right, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Sure. I'm Amanda Jackson, and I'm 19 years old. 19 years old. Okay, Amanda, and how can I help you this afternoon? So it's been going on for a few days now. It's not happened before, and I'm a bit worried. It hurts when I kind of pee. And yeah, it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more. And it's really like I can't go to uni properly. I'm just constantly looking for the toilet. And it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like at the bottom of my tummy as well. Right, okay. I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you. So you mentioned it's been getting on for the last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. You said you're going to the toilet more often as well. Is that right? Yeah, it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days, I think, actually. Maybe just under a week. Oh, under the week, sorry. Okay. Sorry, no, I didn't explain it properly before. Yeah, no, it's been going on for about just under a week. And yeah, I noticed sort of burning, stinging when I go to the toilet. Yeah. Have you noticed anything in your urine, for example, any blood or discoloration of the urine? I think, well, today I noticed that it was like a bit pink, the urine. Yeah. I think just today. Have you noticed any kind of frank blood? I mean, red blood at all in your urine? I think it was in, probably. I don't know, it was pink. Okay, fine. Well, we'll have to definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on. You also mentioned some tummy pain as well. Can you come in a bit more about that pain? Yeah, it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy. Mainly when I go to the loo, I think that's when it's worse. Okay. Can you describe it crampy pain? Is it more of a burning pain? I wouldn't describe it as crampy. I don't think it's like a period pain. It's a bit different. It's hard to say, an achy pain, I suppose. Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back, towards your sides? No, no. Okay, all right. Any other symptoms at all? For example, nausea, vomiting? No, no, nausea vomiting. Okay, any temperatures or fevers? No, no, not that I've noticed. Okay, all right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working okay? I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway. So I don't think it's any different. Okay, than what you're doing. What it usually is. When we say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have? I think I have IBS. So I just kind of pass my bowels like quite a lot. And sometimes it's quite variable, like sometimes it's a bit softer. Sometimes it's a bit, sorry, that's a bit disgusting, but like sometimes it's a bit better and it's kind of hard to predict. Okay, all right. But you've noticed no new issues, no, no, no, new symptoms in your bowels. No, no, not that. All right. And Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions, as you can imagine. Can I ask, are you currently, are you currently sexually active at the moment? Yeah, I have a long-term boyfriend. Okay. And have you noticed any other discharge from down below, so from the front passage? Nothing. No, I don't think so. Nothing unusual. Okay. Do you use any form of contraception? Yeah. I'm on the pill. On the pill? What kind of pill is it? Is it a combined pill or the mini pill? A combined pill. Okay. Fine. When was the last time you had unprotected sex? If you don't want me to ask you. I mean, I mean, unprotected is in like no condoms or anything. Yeah, exactly. I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend. I don't know. We've just kind of agreed. So I guess a week ago, two weeks ago, something. Okay, all right. What I'm trying to get at is whether there's any chance you could be pregnant at all. I know you're on the pill, but we nonetheless we do have to ask. When was your last period? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago. Okay. All right. Just something for us to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better. Okay. Fine. In terms of your general health, otherwise, at the moment, are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, yeah, eating, drinking, okay. I did have one kind of concern. I don't know. So I smoked, this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time like a week and a half ago. I just wonder whether it's related at all. Probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. Sure. Well, thanks for sharing with me. So I don't think it is related to your symptoms. I think it's probably just pure coincidence. But, you know, I do strongly advise you to, you know, make it a regular habit if you can, just for your general health moving forwards. Okay. Moving on, in terms of your health, otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions? Apart from the IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of? No. No. Okay, great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the combined pill? Apart from the pill, I take something for the IBS as well. It begins with an M. It's really hard to pronounce, like mebe something. Maybe. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Okay, and as I for the cramps, the crampy pain. Yeah. Yeah. And do you have any allergies, any medications? Yeah, I think there was an antibiotic called clindosklindamycin. Okay. That I thought like a couple years ago, something, and yeah, that that didn't go too well. Right. Okay, sure. I'll make a note of that. In terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? No. No problem. Johnny, anything else? Good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? So I am living in halls at the moment, uni. So I'm just living with a flatmate, I suppose. But my family live kind of outside of London, not too far away. So yeah, my family are fine, and I see them now and then. Very good. Yeah, things are okay, generally. Great. And what are you studying at university? I'm studying English. English, okay. Good. And how are you enjoying your course? Yeah, yeah, it's going well. Thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago, a few months ago. Yeah, I really enjoy it. Very, yeah. Good. In terms of smoking and alcohol, do you participate in either? As I admitted before, I tried weed for the first time, but I don't smoke. I drink occasionally, kind of socially with friends. Okay, what made you have your first joint last week? It was just a party. There were other people doing it. I kind of was a little bit tipsy, so probably wasn't thinking quite straight. But yeah, I completely agree. It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure. And obviously, your doctor's helping me to look after you. So I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid it. Great. Fine. So at this stage, I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think I'm reassured by the fact that I think it's probably just a simple, what we say, a UTI or a cystitis, bladder infection. You know, you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about. So things like fevers and back pain would be more worrying for me here. So some of them we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. So we've got a choice of two antibiotics, something called trimethoprin or nitroferantoin, which is a three-day course. Normally they're usually quite effective for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well if you can, so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there. Start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids. If you are having some pain, simple paracetamol would probably be advisable. We'll see what the urine sample shows. And if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. But if things are still not getting any better next week, come back and see me and we can have another look again. Okay, okay, great. With the urine sample, how do I go about doing that? Yeah, no, well, good question. So I will give you, I will organise for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices, which we can test there and then with a urine dip and send it off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results. Okay, perfect. Okay, great. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call, okay? Fever, back pain, vomiting. Great. Okay, yeah. That was nice. Okay. Have a good day. Okay. Great. Thank you. You too. Happy day. Bye-bye.
