Yeah, so just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your full name for me, please? Yes, Maria Trabalots. Okay, date and your date of birth. That is the 1st of October 99. Okay. And your email address for me, please. Yes. mtraba at gmail.com okay and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation yes i think i am yeah good right you've mentioned in your in in your patient notes that you're having some sort of lip swelling and you after you had a sandwich is that correct yeah that is well i don't think i don't think it was it wasn't a sandwich but it was it was something with prawn so basically i i sometimes go with my friends to to this place called fetfuck and we we regularly have like usually i have like a normal vegetarian soup or something and yeah and then i wanted to try something new um so what happened was i i ordered a prawn soup it's it's it's called a laxa it's like a soup i ordered a prawn one this time yeah um yeah and then my feels start like my lips started feeling a little weird just in the in the corner sort of on the left first and then i don't know and then we went back we had a little bit of a chat of banter i wasn't really paying attention uh now i feel that that there is a swelling yeah there is like a swelling on my on my upper lip and it's kind of getting bigger i don't know what to do all right so when did you have the prawn soup what time that was that must have been just after work so maybe like around seven okay around seven o'clock and um how long did it take to develop the swelling well i wasn't really paying attention so it must have been like must have been like and a half an hour maybe okay in half an hour you developed the swelling yeah yeah okay and it's getting bigger and bigger yeah you can still feel it like really pumping blood and it's kind of getting bigger it feels like it's getting worse okay so just a few more questions um so you mentioned about your swelling of your lips is there any feeling of swelling in in your throat like your throat is closing up any feeling like that yeah actually i i feel like i can't breathe that well right now okay and do you feel like like your chest is tight i don't know if with the chest it just generally feels a lot difficult okay yeah it might be i'm not sure okay right and just a few have you ever had these any kind of lip swelling in the past after eating any food yeah well maybe i remember like a year ago a year ago i was out with my friends and i think we went like to late night kind of chinese place and i remember that i was quite drunk to be honest and i remember that after like having that very late i woke up the next morning quite swollen up and had also like okay felt really bad and quite difficult breathing right but i don't know what it was i had it was like a curry or something okay uh and what did you take at that time did you use anything like antihistamine or anything when you had that last time well i generally have asthma so i tell i i take oh what's it called salbutamol inhalers yeah yeah so i do take that regularly but i've always taken it i generally have asthma and any other inhalers is it just the salbutamol that you use any other brown inhalers uh no i don't think so no okay right and um so do you use antihistamines like cetrazine loratidine peritin any of those kind of things no but no i think sometimes but i don't know which ones so i have a peanut allergy as well yeah like i've always had it yeah i think i do get antihistamines for that but i'm not sure which ones and any point because you've had peanut allergy anytime you had to ever use like an injection when i was a kid i think i remember my mom told me about it but i don't know what it was because i was small and i changed doctors since right has your mom ever said that you had to go to hospital because you had a severe allergic reaction yeah when i was like six or something i i i think oh sorry the swelling is getting oh oh yeah i think when i was right are you okay now you're busy right now to be honest you feel busy okay right do you have any kind of uh antihistamines with you at the moment no i don't think i have no right okay so right all right i i'm really a bit worried about you at the moment maria um i think we need to call an ambulance because um from what history you've been telling me it sounds like you could be going into what we say an anaphylactic reaction that's when your throat and your chest you know closes in and you might need an injection like what your mom's um you know what your mom told you as you were a young child okay right so is there any anyone with you at the moment or are you alone i'm alone at the moment okay so hang on the line while i'll call the ambulance okay and i'll send them right to you okay and somebody just came somebody just came yes i'm not alone anymore all right okay somebody just came so just call the ambulance make sure that person's with you till the ambulance comes yeah uh and because we are worried about an anaphylactic reaction so you need to go straight away could you ask the person whether they have any antihistamines around in the interim while we are waiting yes uh mom mom do we have any antihistamines around yes yes oh yeah we do that straight away and if mom can call mom if you can call the uh nine nine nine nine nine yeah and say that you're there is a suspected anaphylactic reaction and they need to come straight away okay yes she says she will yes so straight away take the antihistamines in the meantime all right okay okay after you come up from the hospital do give us a ring back we might need to sort you out um with your injections and things like that okay yes yes i'll do yes okay then take care thank you very much
