Hi. Hi, hello. I'm Dr. Jacob. Welcome to Babylon. Hello. Hi. Hi. So just before we start, is it alright if you could confirm your name for me, please? And your date of birth? The 14th of July 1996. And your address for me, please. And 28 Clicks Road S7191EZ. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Thank you. Okay. So you've mentioned in our notes that you've got some chest tightness. If you could like to tell me a bit more about it, please. Yeah, so about two to three days ago, I was running with a friend and usually I could talk to her whilst I ran, but I found myself actually short of breath. I'm not really sure of breath when I'm walking, but definitely if I'm walking briskly now. And I've used my blue inhaler, but to no avail, it hasn't really helped me. So yeah. So I'm having, I'm just wheezing a bit and coughing and just generally a bit short breath. Wheezing and coughing. Okay. And you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler. So how often are you using the blue inhaler? I think I'm just using the as and when I have symptoms. Yeah. So at the moment you are having shortness of breath. So are you using it every day at the moment? Yeah and morning or evening to kind of prevent it as well. Okay. And which colour? What's the name of your preventer? It's a blue. I think in totality, my history is salbutamol, clenol, cetraben and hydrocortisone that I'm taking as well. Okay, so could you repeat that? Your salbutamol, clenol, cetraben and hydrocortisone. And hydrocortisone. So you have eczema also, yeah? What's that, sorry? You do have a history of eczema. My brother's asthmatic and my sister has eczema and I've got a few issues that I think could be eczema as well. Okay, right. So coming back to your, you know, your shortness of breath, you've mentioned your wheezy and your coughing. Are you bringing up any phlegm at all? No, I don't, I'm not covering up much sputum. Okay, no sputum. Okay. Right, Tio. And how are you using your Clenil? So are you using it every day? I think I'm using that every day and the salmon butamol is just like as and when. So how are you using the clenol? Is it twice a day? Yes. Twice. Okay. And have you ever been admitted in hospital because your asthma was so bad? No, I haven't. Okay. Right, you. When was the last time you had an asthma attack? About three to four years ago. Three to four years ago. And what did the DP do at that time? Just encourage me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative. Okay, so you didn't have any steroid or steroids or antibiotics? Not that I can remember. Okay. Okay. Have you ever had oral steroids in the past? No. When was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse? About two years ago. Okay, two years ago. Okay, but your asthma was pretty under control till now, isn't it? Yes, just in the last few days. So do you do a peak flow meter at home? Peak flow reading where you blow into, you know. Do you do that now? Just every now and then. I haven't done it over the last since I've had symptoms. Okay. So what was what's your peak flow reading then you're good? Like normal peak flow reading? I think 130. Okay, let's say it's about 380. Yeah. 380. Okay. Right. So that's your normal, yeah? Right here. Okay. So what we need. Okay, do you have any allergies at all? I have hay fever. Sorry, could you repeat that, please? Sorry, I have hay fever. Hey, okay, no, no, any allergies to medication? Oh, no. Sorry. Okay, so you're not allergic to anything. Okay. So no allergies. Okay. Excellent. Right, here. So what we need to do that, obviously, you haven't had an asthma check for some time and it looks like you can be having a small, small exacerbation. So what I would like you to be seen by one of our GPs in the next few days. In the interim, what I'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when. Okay. I'm going to use it maximum about every two to four hours. But if you're using it that often, that means pretty much that, you know, your asthma is really bad. You can use it, but that's not ideal. The browning, your clenol, the brown inhaler, you can up the dose. If you're using just two puffs twice a day, you can increase it to four pots twice a day. Yeah. And while this is to do while you're waiting to see us. Now, as you mentioned, you know, you're doing what, you know, increase the clenol to four puffs twice a day and you're using the asthma, you know, the blue inhalers every two to four hours and your breathing is getting really worse, then you would need to take yourself to A<unk>E. You shouldn't wait for our appointment. Okay, so when your doctor sees you, what we're going to do is we're going to examine your chest. Yeah. Make you do the peaks that you're reading. So depending on what we find, you might need some antibiotics or some steroids. But anyway, while you're at home, we are going to, by increasing your clenel, we are increasing your steroid intake anyway. Okay. So, yeah. So any questions you wanted to ask me? I know that's the end of the thing. Yeah. So book an appointment, call support, book an appointment to see and I will recommend that you do the face-to-face. In the interim, increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly. But if your breathing's getting worse and you've not seen us, do take yourself to A<unk>E. All right. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much for your time. You're welcome. Take care then. Bye-bye now. Bye. Bye.
