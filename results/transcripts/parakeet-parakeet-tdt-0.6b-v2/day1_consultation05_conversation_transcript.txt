Hello. Good morning, Kim. How can I help you this morning? So I'm feeling some pain in my tummy, like the lower part of my tummy. Okay. And I'm just being quite hot and sweaty. Right. I'm sorry to hear that. When did your symptoms all start? About two days ago. Okay. And whereabouts in your tummy is the pain exactly? Like below my belly button. It's like quite sore when I press on it. Okay. Did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual? So it hasn't been, it's more gradual and it's just, it's getting a bit worse now. Okay, okay. And can you describe the pain to me? It's kind of like a, I guess a burning pain and it's just right there in that spot. Like that's mostly where I'm feeling it. It hasn't spread anywhere else. Justin, just below your belly button you mentioned. Yeah. Okay. And is the pain constant or does it come and go? It's nearly constant. It's like getting worse. It's not like I can still move and walk around. I mean I'm still kind of functioning. It's just I'm aware of it all the time. Okay. And with the pain have you noticed any other symptoms at all? So for example, let's focus firstly on your bowels. Are your bowels working okay? Yeah I had a bit of constipation but that's better now that was like since last week. Okay so you've got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose dulls? No, my bowel movements are normal now. Okay and what about your water works? Are you passing urine okay? Yeah I'm fine that's fine. I did notice that I was a little the urine was a little pink in colour but I haven't like it hasn't really been burning specifically or hurting when I pee and I did notice I was going to the I was peeing more regularly but I have been drinking lots of fluid so I wasn't sure I wasn't sure if that was related to the pain. When you mentioned pink urine do you was there any blood at all in your urine or is it difficult to say? I can't say I mean maybe. Okay all right but otherwise it doesn't hurt or sting when you pass urine. I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that. Just that I'm peeing more than off more regularly. Okay. Okay. And moving up to other symptoms. Have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all? Just a little nauseous but no vomiting. No vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers? I haven't really, I felt a bit hot and sweaty but I haven't really measured it so I can't really say. Okay fine. And Kim, do you have to ask all female patients? It's just questions about your cycles if you don't mind me asking. Are you currently currently sexually active? Yeah I've had the same partner. We were last sexually active about four days ago. My last STD screen was normal which was about six months ago. Okay so you've had no other partners since then? No other partners since then. Okay and do you use any contraception at all? I'm on the implanon. I had the implanon inserted about a year ago. Implement, okay, fine. Are you still having periods? Yes. When was your last period? My last period was about three weeks ago. I mean two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, okay. So is it any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implement in but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant. It's something for us to think about potential. Well we don't use any other barrier methods so we just use the I just have the implanon and the same partner. Theoretically if the implanton hasn't been working then I could be pregnant but I don't suspect. Okay well it's something for us to think about maybe worth doing a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that. Okay and so just to summarise so far if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple of days this tummy pain has really affected you mainly lower down towards your belly button. It's quite burning you said is getting worse. You notice some pink urine but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine. Your bowels are working okay. You felt a little bit nauseous and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right? Yeah that sounds very accurate. Is there anything else perhaps you feel like you should share with me at this stage which you think might be important? I don't think so. I think we've covered everything that's really bothering me. Yeah okay tell me a bit more about your medical history otherwise. Are you normally fitting well? Yeah quite well. I haven't had any surgical, I don't have any surgical history. I don't have any previous, I haven't had any operations before or and I'm not on any other medication. I just had the implanon. Okay. Have you had anything like this before in the past? Any similar symptoms? I've never had these symptoms before. No, okay. Fine. Any other family history I should be aware of? Anything relevant? Family related to the bowels, maybe related to gyne history? No, not that I'm aware of. Okay, all right. And socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? I live in a share house with two other two other roommates. Okay. And are you currently working? Yeah, I currently, I am currently working. What do you do for work? I am an accountant. Okay. Great, okay. Do you smoke at all, Kim? No. No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Socially I drink, but I don't think more than normal. No, okay. Okay. Just before I go to examination, I just want to go through just a few screening questions. That's okay. Yes or no? We've covered the majority of them already, but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else. How's your chest? How's your breathing? I don't feel short of breath or I'm not having any problems or I don't have a cough or anything that's worrying me. Okay, any funny heartbeats or rhythms, palpitations? Not that, no. Okay. Any headaches, any problems with your vision? No. No. Okay, all right. Fine, okay. So really just moving on. So based on your story, really, Kim, it's a difficult one. We know you've got some primary pain. We don't exactly know what's causing it. It could be a few different things that could be causing your pain. Could just be a, you know, it could just be a urine infection, for example. Could this be something related to your gut? Could this be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy-related cause? And so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out what's going on here, which I can organise for you today. Okay. And based on those tests, we will have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed. But certainly, if it's been going on for the last couple of days, you know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for maybe a urine infection. And so with some antibiotics... Can we do that instead of me going for a test and then seeing how that goes? Yeah, absolutely. So I think it's certainly worth covering you with some antibiotics today. But I still want you to bear in mind, you know, having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here. And I want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days' time if your symptoms are not getting any better or indeed if they're getting worse. So things to look out for would be, you know, worsening tummy pain, if you're feeling really hot and sweaty, the temperature is not coming down, vomiting, etc. Does that make sense? Yeah, I think I'm happy with that plan. Okay. You can try just regular painkillers. Paracetamol will be advisable. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids. You can try some cranberry juice as well, which can sometimes help with your urine symptoms. Take the antibiotics and give me a call if you are worried about anything else. Sure, that sounds great. Thank you very much. Should I just collect the script at my pharmacy? Yeah, but I'll send it straight to your pharmacy. Start the antibiotics today, something called trimethoprin. We'll take two tablets, one tablet twice a day for three days. Okay, that sounds great. Let's hear you get on. Okay, thank you very much. Great. All the best. Bye. Bye-bye.
