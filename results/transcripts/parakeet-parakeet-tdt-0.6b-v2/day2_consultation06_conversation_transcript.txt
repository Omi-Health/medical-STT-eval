At the moment. Hello. Hi there. I'm Dr. Dean Mezza from Babylon. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi. Sorry. Before we stop, could I get your full name and date of birth? Is that possible? Yeah, sure. My name is John Doe, and I'm 27 years old. So I was born in 1991, 17th of November. That's perfect. Thank you for that. Are you, John? Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yeah. Perfect. Thank you for that. Okay, so tell me what the problem is. You've been having some difficulty breathing. Is that correct? Yeah, exactly. I'm kind of struggling to breathe at the moment. I got stung by a wasp recently. Well, I'm not sure whether it's kind of bitten or stung. But I'm feeling like slightly anxious that there's a bit of, I've got a bit of a rash on my arm where I got stung. And I kind of, yeah, as I say, I've got this difficulty breathing and potentially there's a bit of swelling in my lips and tongue. Feels a bit weird. Right. Okay. So when did this bee sting or bee bite occur? It was just a few minutes ago. Right. Okay. And your lips don't seem swollen to me right now, but do they, which can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen? Yeah, it's just kind of on the right-hand side and it's just a bit sore. Maybe it hasn't kind of fully swollen up yet. Okay. You said you've been having some difficulty breathing. Yeah. Your breathing seems all right to me right now. The reason why I'm clarifying that is because we have to decide whether this is an acute emergency, whether I need to send you into hospital straight away or whether it's more time to ask questions. Okay. So do you feel that you've got difficulty breathing right now this minute as we speak? I don't feel like it's particularly acute, but I'm just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a bit worse. Sure. I just wanted to speak to someone. Sure. You do the right thing. And I can understand. It is quite anxiety-provoking. Okay. All right. Can I just double-check before we carry on to ask any other questions? Have you got a history of anaphylaxis? Not that I know of. No, okay. Have you ever been given an EpiPen? I haven't, no. Okay, all right. Let's take a step back now. So in terms of the B-sing, did you see the B or you're just assuming it was a B? I find it difficult to tell the difference between a B and a wasp, but one of the two. Yeah, it was one of the two. Okay, okay. And the area of your body that's stung, where was it? Do you say it was your arm? Yeah, it was on my arm. All right. And you've got a rash there. Can I have a look? Yeah, sure. It's just there. Okay, all right. That looks okay to me right now. Does it look red to you at the moment? It's slightly red, yeah. And kind of there's a bit of a like a hole there where I think that the puncture mark. Yeah, okay, all right. Now, is there any swelling around that area that you can see? I couldn't see any. Not particularly. I guess it's just a bit kind of blotchy and a bit of a rash. It doesn't feel like particularly swollen. Sure. Okay, all right. Now, have you taken any medications? You probably haven't because it was a few minutes ago, but have you is it not taking any antihistamines or anything like that? Not at the moment, no. Nothing, nothing yet. Okay. Now, if I can just go back, do you have any history of any kind of illnesses at all? I've had eczema before. Okay. That's kind of the major thing. Nothing, nothing. Okay. Have you got the history of any allergies to anything? I'm allergic to penicillin. All right. Good. And in your family, is there any history of any illnesses or any history of any kind of acute... Not that I think is particularly relevant. No, I don't have any. Right. And do you have allergies to any kind of cats or dogs or pets or anything like that? Not that I know of. Yeah, I've been around dogs and cats. And you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware. No. Okay. Can I ask, do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks or anything like that? Yeah, sometimes, occasionally. Right, okay. Have you ever been on medication for that? No. No. Great. Now, I need to ask a few questions, maybe not directly related to this, but just for general information purposes. So are you working at the moment? Yes. What do you work as? I am a computer scientist. Okay. And are you living alone? Yes. Okay. Do you have any pets at home? I have a cat. A cat. Okay, great. What I'd like to do now, if that's okay, John, is I'd like to have a look inside your mouth. Okay. One of the things that we'd be worried about if someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction is to see whether there's any swelling of the lips or the tissues inside the mouth, the soft tissues of the airway. And I've got a fairly good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can bring your device closer to your mouth and then put your head back, mouth open wide, sit somewhere where there's good lighting. And I just want to have a look inside the throat, if that's okay. Perfect. Okay, great. Now, can I just get you to do it again? Just say ah this time? Ah. Okay, fantastic. Brilliant. Okay. John, based on how you look, how you're talking to me, how you're breathing, and the appearance on your wrist, I don't feel that you're having a life-threatening allergic reaction. Now, it's very normal to have a rash when you have some kind of insect bite. It's a localized inflammatory reaction that is normal. And that immediate reaction, that redness and that's maybe slight swelling, is usually temporary. What we're worried about is when someone has compromised of their breathing. So you mentioned breathing difficulties and the amount of swelling of your lip. Thankfully, I can't see any of that right now. But that's the most urgent and most pressing thing that we'll be watching out for. Given that it hasn't happened initially, it's unlikely to happen later. Okay, so we have like a stage one, a stage two reaction for these types of bites. And usually if you're going to have their reaction, it will happen straight away. So we may be coming out of the danger zone now. But I'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are in case it happens. So for example, you would have swelling of the lips, difficulty breathing. You might have something called stridor, which is an inspiratory sound that when you're trying to breathe, it makes like a rasmus sound like this. Okay, so thankfully, you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me that this is a localized allergic reaction. However, if anything changes, if anything deteriorates, either make an appointment with us or go straight to A<unk>E. And in some cases, if it's progressing rapidly, it's better to go straight to A<unk>E rather than to wait for a booked appointment with us. What I'd like you to do now is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines. So you can buy them at the counter. You can get pyriton or chlorphenamine. And you can take one tablet, four milligrams, up to about six times a day. Or you can just take a one-a-day one, whichever is your preference. That's absolutely fine. There's no issue. That should be enough to control this. If the redness in your arm spreads and you feel hot or you have signs of any localized infection, we may need to think about other treatments like an antibiotic. And like I said, if anything deteriorates in terms of your breathing, that's urgent. And we need to process that. Action needs to be taken urgently. Did you have any other queries or was there anything else that you were worried about? No, I think that kind of, that makes me feel a bit better. I guess, can I get that? Can I get the antihistamine from any shop? Or like, does it have to be a pharmacy? Yeah, over the counter. You don't need to, any chemist will have it. You don't need to. Yeah, it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually than to get it via prescription. Okay. Now, on the basis of what you've told me, I don't think you need any allergy testing. I think this is just a straightforward localized reaction to an insect bite. However, if it was to happen that, you know, you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other non-specific rashes, you might need to think about blood testing. I don't think we're at that moment yet. Okay. So but that's something to bear in mind in case this becomes a recurrent pattern. Okay. Okay then. So we'll leave it like that for now. Okay. I'm going to leave it to some information about anaphylactic reactions just for you to read about it. I don't mean to panic, but just for you to be aware of what some of the symptoms are. If those kind of things happen, get back to us. If you're feeling worried, just have a low threshold for having a chat with us. Sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down. Okay, great. Yeah, that makes sense. All right, then, John. Okay. Well, we'll leave it like that. Come back to us if you have any further issues. Okay, thanks. I appreciate your time. My pleasure. All right. Take care then. All the best. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
