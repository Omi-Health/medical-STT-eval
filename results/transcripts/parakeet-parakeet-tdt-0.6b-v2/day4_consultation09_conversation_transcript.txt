Hello. Oh, hello. Hi. Hi. How are you doing? My name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I confirm your name, please? Yeah, Daniel Redman. Hi, Daniel. And your date of birth? Yeah, May 11th, 1992. 92. Okay, Daniel. And are you in a comfortable and confidential place to talk? Yeah, totally. Happy to go ahead. Great. How can I help? Yeah, I just, my chest has been feeling really tight. Okay. And how long has this been going for you, Daniel? For about three hours now. Okay. And so tight chest for three hours. And so you're born in 92, so it makes you 26. 26, yeah. And you are any shortness of breath at all with that? Yeah, like a little bit. Yeah, a little bit short of breath. Not too bad. Any cough, wheeze? Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well. Coffee, coughing, yeah. Tight cough, yeah. Yeah. Sore throat, runny nose, sore ears. You know, I had a cold last week and it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat. I had a runny nose, just feeling under the weather. You're feeling better now than the tight chest. I mean, I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore. Right. Okay. Okay. But you know, now you've got this. So you've still got still got symptoms of a cold, essentially. Yeah, the cough's kind of stuck around. Yeah, okay. And are you coughing up anything? No. And do you have any other medical problems like asthma? Yeah, yeah, I have asthma. I've had it for a while now. And then I have like a hay fever, you know, some allergies, dust. Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any medications? Yeah. So, you know, the ventilin, it's called salbutamol. Yeah. I got that one. And then I have a steroid, clenol, clenol inhaler. Clenol modulate, yeah. Okay. Yeah. And have you been using clinol and the ventilin? And how often have you been using them? Well, to be honest, I was away at uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me. So I haven't really in the past week. Both of them. Because sorry, they ran out and I forgot to go and grab the next one. Yeah, sure. About a week ago. Okay. All right. All right. So you haven't got any clinol or any ventilin at the moment? Not with me right now until I ran out. Okay. All right. And any drug allergies that you know of? No. No. Not allergic to anything. Just like just the dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs. Okay, great. Now, do you, anyone in your family had any medical problems that you know of? Yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Oh, when I was young, I also had eczema. And I had the milk protein allergy when I was young too. Okay. Right. So just do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or hopes for this consultation? Not really. Like I feel like asthma is probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers would be helpful. It's just kind of scary because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight in a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I can imagine. Well, it certainly sounds like you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough and it's non-productive cough and you're short of breath. Is the cough worse at night time? I mean it gets a little bit worse at night, but basically just pretty consistent. Yeah. It hasn't gone away. Okay. And you've got this tight, tight chest. But even though you've got chest pain, there's more of a tight chest, is that? No, not really pain. It's more like tight. It just feels like sometimes I can't get a full breath in, you know? Yeah, sure. Okay, well, I would quite like to certainly get you some ventilin, clinol modulate. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit more, like back in high school. But I've been pretty good at taking my inhalers, so not so much anymore. Have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient, as in, you know, stayed in there overnight for asthma? Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat. Oh, okay. So you went to hospital and had a... So you stayed in hospital for a few days, did you, with an asthma exacerbation? Yeah, I did, yeah. Okay, but currently you're just on ventilin and clinol and you haven't got any of those inhalers at the moment. I'd be pretty good. I'd be pretty good just on the clinol and the salbutamol. Okay. Sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exercising? I think I was like 17, 16, maybe. Sure. Okay. Just to quantify how short of breath you are, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you. No, you won't have will you? Are you able to like walk up a flight of stairs okay, walk on the flat okay, without getting too short of breath? Or are you short of breath of rest? I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like except for that feeling I was describing. It does when I'm walking upstairs, I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be. Sure. Yeah, okay, but you're not sure of breath at rest at the moment. So, no, no, I'm not. Okay, fine. So, what I think, and just to go over, is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the a prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting from this? Well, I just want to know that I'm okay. So just like keep, I just don't want to have to get that intubation again. Sure, yeah. No, absolutely. Well, I'm really glad that you've talked to me today. I think what we can do is give you a prescription for some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within the hour, I would hope. And I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So these are tablets which you can take for five days, two tablets in the morning, and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response. Okay. Okay. Now, there are some side effects to the steroids, which I should really tell you about, but please read the label that's associated with. Don't be too worried about the side effects. Most of the time, the steroids are very well tolerated. And you probably, have you had them in the past, do you know of? Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Have you had steroids in the past? I can't remember. Probably. Probably. Yeah, I would probably do. So they can come, they can make you, your mood change can be slightly low or slightly high, can give you a high blood sugar. And they can also cause rash nausea, headaches, but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help you asthma an awful lot. What I'd like to do is send you these, some prescriptions for your inhalers are ongoing. So you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can use the clinol modulate in the morning with ventilin as a PRN, so a ventilin when you need to, when you're getting noisy. If you should start to use the ventilin more than every three hours at any time, it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So see a doctor in some capacity. And the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before? Yeah, yeah. Somebody taught me how to use it on a while ago. I don't really use it, to be honest. Have you got one? I think I do. I have one somewhere. Okay. All right. Well, I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside, breathing in and out for five or ten breaths. Okay. Yeah. So was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage? I think you got me covered. Okay. And I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're okay with that. Thank you. All right. Alrighty. Well, thank you very much. No worries. Any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath or just generally concerning symptoms, pain in your chest, tightness, feeling light-headed, then seek further medical attention anytime, please. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
