Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me okay? I can hear you, but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Is that okay? Am I meant to just have a connection on the screen? It's audio. No, no, it's absolutely fine. Now, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? So my name is Dan Chowdhury. I am 27. 27, okay. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan? So I've just been having some troubles. Basically, I guess it's been a little while now, and I've just been feeling not so great. And it's all come from like, it's like basically, I think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out, like loads of it. Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it, yeah, it doesn't feel very solid. It's just, it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out. And it's, yeah, it's just not been very pleasant. And like, I just, it just kind of hasn't, doesn't feel like it's getting better. So. Wow, no. Sorry to hear that. It seems like there's a lot going on there. Well, when does it all start, your symptoms? So I think it was a few. When I think about it, so Monday, Tuesday. I think it was about three. It's been about three days now. Okay. And is it mainly diarrhea? So you mentioned watery stools. How many times are you going a day, would you say? So I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Right, well, okay, so you're losing a lot of... All right. You're losing a lot of fluid there. Yeah, so I mean, I'm trying to drink a lot of water, but yeah, it's just quite a lot. And it's, yeah, I think I feel like it's just fluids coming out. Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stools? So no, I don't remember anything like... No, I think it's just nothing like that. There's nothing like that. And any tummy pain? Any pain in your tummy? Yeah, I mean, I feel a cramp. And then I know it's time to go, right? So around every hour, I just feel something come up and then I have to go. So yeah, I mean, that's the kind of the first sign. And where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? It's kind of, I still want to, if I think about it, it's like, it's like at the bottom. I don't know if that makes sense. Well, why don't we start with, is it in the middle or is it to one particular side? I think it feels pretty like in the middle to me, not on any side, left or right. Okay. And does this pain come and go or is it there constantly? It comes and goes. It comes and goes. Fine, okay. And if I was to ask on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you've ever had, how bad is this pain? Okay, so like so what do you mean by uh pain? So I think it's maybe is this pain that's making you double over? Is it 10 out of 10 the worst pain you've ever had or is it more of a kind of a mild pain like a three out of ten? I guess so I'm when I think about it like when I get it I can pretend that I don't feel it so I can still sit down and I can still like cover it up and people don't really notice so I don't know what that means but maybe is that like a six or a seven? All right good. And apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Yeah I definitely I definitely feel kind of nauseous like I and like I've have vomited I think it's maybe something to do with like whenever I have like milk or something like that I just feel like I want to vomit and actually like yeah one time I just like had some milk and I just completely vomited it. Not eating. Okay. I've been trying to avoid it but yeah. But the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea. Is that right? Sorry could you repeat that? The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhea. Is that right? No, no it's not. Okay all right. Any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? So I yeah I think I am pretty I feel kind of really hot all the time and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that but it's yeah I've sure I'm not like not a normal temperature. Okay so you're feeling hot okay in terms of your water works are you passing urine okay? Yeah but I guess less frequently maybe but yeah it seems to be okay. Okay all right. Fine. And you certainly mentioned three days ago is when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean have you for example gone out had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else with diarrhea for example? So I know so my brother has had actually had something like this for he has it as well for five days as well. And I'm not yeah I can't think of what the trigger is for me. I mean my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me but yeah that's why is your brother now better? So he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better but I'm not I'm not really sure. He said he had he's had something for a little while as well. Okay all right. Are you having anything to eat and drink? I can see you're drinking your coffee but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? So it just feels like the fluids do go down but it just feels like it's going straight through. Just feels like it's going straight through. Okay all right fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat which kept which which you kept in? So I had some I mean I had some lunch today but again it just came out pretty loose. Okay all right and Dan moving forwards are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical history? So I yeah I think I think otherwise I'm fitting well. Yeah I mean I'm an okay weight and I can't think of any related medical history. I mean like my yeah no I don't think so. I'll take it you don't take any regular medications then. So I um no I mean I've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately but I haven't been I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. Okay. And do you have any allergies, any medications? So I don't have any allergies that I know of. Okay. What about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? So would bowel like does is the colon like something? Yeah. Yeah. So what I mean by bowel is a whole gut really. People are so my yeah my my dad actually has colon cancer at the moment. Oh dear I'm very sorry to hear that. How is he? So from what I heard he's kind of so I don't I don't speak to him that often so I don't I don't know the exact details and I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing but he's sort of in his third stage. I'm not sure what that means exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah it's it's he's yeah you can I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting him a lot and that's quite I guess he's had it for a little while now. Well I'm really sorry I'll make a note though because it's always important to know these kind of details. And socially tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you Dan? So not my brother. He doesn't live with me. I live with my sister and my mum. And how are things at home? In what sense do you mean that? In general day-to-day life are you managing okay? Any particular factors? I mean I think yeah it's been it's been tricky going to work with all of this. I dislike taking time off work. I feel like I just want to go when I can so I try and go I think at home yeah I just haven't really normally actually eat with my family. I normally I'm buying stuff and that kind of thing. So I don't think it's affected them and I haven't really been I haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mum about it. Yeah I'd just rather deal with these things. You mentioned work. What is it you do for work? So I work at a I work at an office in central London. So I work in government. Government, okay. So I'll say okay right. Just a couple of last final couple couple of questions there. Smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? So I smoke. I smoke for like socially, but not like regularly. So normally if it's a Friday or something like that, I might have a cigarette or something like that. Sorry? And alcohol? So alcohol, I might have a beer during the weekdays, not that many, maybe. On Fridays, I have more alcohol. But yeah, buy a lot more units. I suppose, not every week, but maybe once or twice a month that yeah, I'll go out with my friends and drink a lot. So that's, yeah. Well, thank you for sharing with me. That's very helpful to know. So Dan, just as a conclusion, just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis. Okay. A bit of a basically an infection of your tummy. There's nothing to worry about. I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days, just like I did for your brother. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids, okay? Should I just drink like normal water? I just feel like every time I drink, it's just coming out. Clear fluids is probably the best, but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. So you can get things like dirolite, which is a fluid replacement which you can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth recommending that. Do I need like a prescription for that? No, you can just get over the counter. Okay. You can try just a regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so 48 hours, I want you to give me a callback because if you are getting dehydrated, then we need to do further investigations, okay? But I think let's see how you are in the next one to two days. Okay. And we'll catch up soon, okay? Okay, so you're saying that I should, I could, I'll try and buy this diarrhoea. What should I do in terms of food and that kind of thing? Should I just go just fluids? Food, dissolving, yeah, absolutely. So clear fluids, you can use soft diet, things like soup, mash, and then gradually build up as much as your body can tolerate. But really, let's try and keep yourself well hydrated first, okay? Okay, is it okay for me to carry on having like paracetamol and things like that? Absolutely. If you are having, if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think paracetamol is very sensible. Okay. Try and avoid alcohol if you can. Okay, I'll try. Yeah. Okay. All right, Dan. Okay. Thank you for your help. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks for taking me out.
