Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. Should we stop? Yeah, okay. Hello. Good morning, so how can I help you this morning? Hi, I've just had some diarrhea for the last three days and it's been affecting me. I need to stay close to the toilet and yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities. Sorry to hear that. And when you say diarrhea, what do you mean by diarrhea? Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often or are your stools more loose? Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stool, going to the toilet quite often and like some pain in my like lower stomach. Okay. And how many times a day are you going, let's say, over the last couple of days? Probably like six, seven times a day. Six, seven times a day. And you may mention this mainly watery. Have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools? No, no blood. Yeah, just watery and loose stool. Okay. And you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well. Yep. Whereabouts is the pain? Exactly. So it's like in my lower abdomen. So like, yeah, just to one side. One side. And what side is that? On the left side. Yeah, side, okay. And can you describe the pain to me? Yeah, it feels like a cramp, like a muscular cramp. And yeah, I feel a bit weak and shaky. Okay. And there's a pain, is it there all the time or does it come and go? It comes and goes. Does a pain move anywhere else, for example, towards your back? No, just mainly my stomach. Okay, fine. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well. What do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been having feverish, for example? Yeah, it doesn't feel like... Yeah, I just mainly feel weak. I haven't had a fever at the moment, but I did notice a temperature when the symptoms started. So, yeah, around about three or four days ago. Did you measure your temperature then? Yeah, I didn't measure my temperature, no, but I felt just a bit hot. Okay, okay. Any other symptoms like sweating or night? No. No. And any vomiting at all? Yeah, so I vomited at the start of the symptoms, but now I've stopped vomiting. You stopped vomiting, okay. And was your vomit? I know it's not nice to talk about, but was it just normal food colour? Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit. And there was no blood in your vomit. Is that right? No blood, no. No, okay. And any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhea, you mentioned your vomiting. Anything else that comes to mind? I had a loss of appetite, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids. Okay, so you're drinking fluids. What kind of foods have you managed to eat, anything? Just soups and yeah, light foods, like smoothies and yeah, liquid foods mainly. Okay, fine. And so you started three days ago, Simpsons. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused your symptoms to kick on? So for example, things like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people who had similar symptoms? Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago. But other than that, I've been eating normally. I think unusual, yeah. Do you remember what you ate? Yeah, I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Okay. Anyone else unwell with similar symptoms? So no one else in the family, so I have a wife and two kids and one child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms. Okay, okay, fine. Right. And in terms of your overall health, are you normally fitting well? Yeah, I mean, other than asthma, I use an inhaler, everything else is fine. Okay. And is your asthma well controlled? Yeah, that's fine. Just use an inhaler and that's under control. Fine. And you don't have any other tummy problems, bowel problems I should be aware of. No. No, okay. Apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications? No, no other medications. Okay, fine. And in terms of just your day-to-day life, you said it's been affecting your life. In what way has it been affecting your life? So I need to stay close to the toilet because I go quite frequently during these past three days. Yeah, other than that, it's the main concern. And are you currently working at the moment? Yes. Yeah, I work. Work? I'm an accountant. Okay. Have you been going to work the last three days or have you been at home? Yeah, I've been going to work. Okay. That must be difficult for you then. Yeah, it's been quite difficult. Right. And you say you mentioned you live with a wife and two children, is that right? Yes, yeah. All right. Just a couple of other questions we need to ask. Do you smoke at all? No, I don't smoke. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No, I don't drink alcohol, no. Okay. So normally at this stage, I like to examine you, if that's okay. But having listened to your stories, I think, just to recap, for the last three days you've been having loose stool, diarrhea, a bit of tummy pain, mainly on the left-hand side, and vomiting and feeling generally quite weak and lethargic. You mentioned you're having this Chinese takeaway as well three days ago, and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. It seems like you may have something called gastroenteritis, which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your tummy, mainly caused by viruses, but it can be a possibility of bacteria causing your symptoms. At this stage, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just making sure you're well hydrated. So drinking fluids. There are things like dirolite you can get from the pharmacy, which it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. Okay. And if you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would certainly recommend that in the first couple of days. If you are feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. I would certainly advise you to take some time off work. Actually, I know you're quite keen to work. I would say next two to three days as the pressure clears from your system, just take some time off and rest. If your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in three to four days, I'd like to come back and see you again. Okay, sure. Because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing symptoms. And we may need to do further tests like taking a sample of your stool so we can test that, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, sure. How's that sound? That sounds great. Yeah. Do you have any questions for me? No, no further questions. Okay. Is the treatment plan clear? Yeah, that's very clear. Thank you. Great. Well, I wish you all the best. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
