Yeah, like as in like I have like vaginal, sometime bleeding, but it's like a light color and sometimes I'm constipated. Okay. So when was your last period? Last month, two weeks ago? Yeah, I'm sorry. About two weeks, three weeks ago? Okay. And are you having sexual intercourse regularly? Yes, yes, I do. Four weeks ago, four days ago, sorry, I just had. Are you using any contraception? Yes, I am using from last one year and implanon. It's called Implanon. Okay. And do you have your period? Do you have your periods when you, since you've been using the implanon, do you have periods? Yes, I am. Ideally, or are they sporadic? They are sporadic, like not all the time. It changes, yeah. Right, okay. And was your last period normal? Yeah, and any problems with nausea or vomiting? Yeah, I feel nauseated. I feel like vomiting, but I don't, I get nauseated, but I don't vomit. Right, and have you been eating and drinking okay? Yeah, yeah, my regular activities and drinking and other things seems to be okay. Yeah, but it's just a very uncomfortable at times. Okay, and have you opened your bowels normally? Sorry. Have you opened your bowels normally? You've been to the bottom. What problems did you have last week? Like I was constipated for a week, like I was having problems. Okay, and what about this week? Yeah, it seems to be okay. It's fine now. You go to the toilet every day? Yeah. And is the stool normal or diarrhea or hard stool? No, it's normally painting now. Yeah, not like last week. And you said you'd had some vaginal bleeding? Yes, yes. Is that since your period stopped? Yeah, my period stopped like last two weeks ago. And this is different. I can see it because it's not really like dark. It's just slight pink colour. So I don't know what is it. I cannot say exactly what it is, but I can see it in the... Any abnormal discharge, other discharge, or just this light bleeding? There is no extra other vaginal discharge. Okay. Any difficulty breathing or pain in your shoulders or anything like that? No. And have you had a high temperature? Have you got a thermometer? No, I don't. I should be okay. Do you feel feverish? No. And do you feel faint when you stand up? No. What have you been doing for the last few days? Have you been at work as normal or had to stay at home? Yes, I have been. I'm doing my work, regular other activities like cooking and stuff. It seems broke just when I get the pain. It's just very bad. Okay, but you said the pain's constant there all the time or is it getting worse from time to time? It is getting worse. Yeah, definitely. Okay. Have you had any other medical problems in the past? Yeah, I have allergy. I have amoxiline. Pardon? Amoexillin? Allergy. Okay, anything else? Have you had any operations? No. Have you had any pregnancies? No. Have you taken a pregnancy test this time? Yeah, I did. When was that? Yeah, from like a month ago. Okay, but not since you've had the abdominal pain. Okay. And any surgery in the past? And what's your job day to day? Yeah, I'm a teacher. Okay, and who do you live with at home? My husband and my husband's family. Okay. And do you smoke or drink alcohol? I don't know. Do you take any other drugs? No. Have you been abroad recently? Yes. Whereabouts to? Out in a year. Padem? Oh, a year ago, not recently. No. And any problems passing water? No. Any pain or strong smell or having to go more often than normal? No, I don't really. I have noticed that I don't really go often like before. So yeah, I do drink a lot though. Right, okay. And any weight loss or blood in the stool or urine? Yes, I have, as I said, I have some, I can see some discharge and bleeding, but then I don't, other than that, there is no discharge. Fine. I think with the abdominal pain, as it's getting worse and it's been going on for the last few days, it would be very helpful to be able to examine you properly. Would you be happy to have an examination with the doctor? Yes. Okay. So what we can do is we can arrange a face-to-face examination where they can see you in a clinic and do an abdominal examination and advise further from them when we've got more of an idea what's causing the problem. Would you be happy to call the support line and arrange that appointment? Yes. Okay, that's fine. So we'll do that. In the meantime, if it gets a lot worse or you're not holding any fluids down, then we should see you before then. Did you say your pregnancy test was a month ago? Yes. Okay. And your implanon was just put in a year ago? Yes. The other thing we would need to do is to do a pregnancy test today, if possible. I would do it. So if you can do that today, and if it's positive, we need to see you straight away, so it gives a call back. Yes. Okay. Have you got any other questions? Right. Okay. So if you call the support line and make an appointment, we'll go from there. Thank you. Thanks.
