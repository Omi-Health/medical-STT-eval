Hello, can you hear me okay? Yes, I can. Can you hear me? Yeah, good, good. So my name is Joe. I'm a doctor here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? My name is Vincent. And your date of birth? 9th of May, 2016. Okay, great. I know you in a safe place I'm sorry a safe and confidential place to talk and just have to go ahead with a consultation yes yes I am great so how can I help yeah so I have a call that I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week and it's been caused me problems I've had to stay away from work for about three or four of those days because of about it okay I'm sorry to hear that so you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week and what can what came first the sore throat came first and then after they are to the clock okay and are you coughing up anything no it's very dry okay so I'm just going to ask a few questions about the your current symptoms and then a little bit about your background and something else about what we can do a a little bit later on in the consultation to help you. But before we go on, anything you're particularly concerned about or have any ideas what might be going on? You said that you had a cold. Well, I mean, you know how we all are. Once this happens, you Google it, and it seems to be all kinds of bad things. It could be a cold or flu, obviously, because it could be tuberculosis, it could be cancer, it always comes up. So it would be good if none of those. Right, so yeah, I can provide a little bit of reassurance and we can talk about those a little bit as well. And was there anything you were particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation? Well, yeah, so reassurance, so like hopefully some sense that it's not anything too serious, but also if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better or any advice, or maybe even a sick note, so if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer, I can get one. Sure sure Okay All right So we talk a little bit about the symptoms and I sure we can get those things sickly and some reassurance about your concerns So you mentioned that you started with a sore throat about a week ago developed into a bit of a dry cough I just ask a few questions around those So do you have any shortness of breath? Yes, yes. I've been having shortness of breath. Yeah, I've been having shortness of breath. You are short of breath. And do you have any wheeze or chest pain? Yeah, a bit of both. You're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well? Yes. Okay. And when did you start to develop the shortness of breath? Let's see. So, today is Friday. So, it was about last Friday or Thursday. Cough was starting. So, the shortness of breath was, I think, shortly after the cough, so maybe a day or two later, so three or four days ago. Three or four days ago you started developing shortness of breath. And is the cough worse at night time? No, it's the same throughout the day. Same throughout the day. And when you say you're short of breath, just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are. So are you able to walk up a flight of stairs, for example, or are you short of breath at rest? Oh yeah, it's like when I'm doing walking, and I do exercise now and then. So it hasn't been super bad, like it hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual and a little bit worrying. And you're a bit concerned about that, okay. So I just need to ask a few things about your background as well. So do you have any other medical conditions or medical history? No, just no, no past medical history, no. No past medical, no history of asthma, No. And any history of clots on your legs or your lungs? These are DVPs or PEs. No one in your family has had those, clots on the legs or the lungs? Well, my mother had lung cancer. Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke? No. Have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos? I don't know if asbestos ever smoked. I mean once or twice in Amsterdam but not really. Okay and this just going back to the your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough it a dry cough no you not coughing up any phlegm Do you have and you say you don have any chest pain as such Are you taking any medications currently No, I'm not. Are you allergic to any medications? Not to any medication, but I'm allergic to peanuts. Peanuts, okay. And you mentioned that your mother had lung cancer. Any other family history of any significant illnesses when running into family? No, no, that's the only one, just lung cancer from my mother. Just lung cancer. Okay. And you say you have a cold. So do you have sinus congestion or ... No, it seems to be almost entirely with just my throat. My nose is spinning out. Just your throat. Any recent travel or have you always lived in the UK? No, I haven't always lived in the UK. So I was born in the US and moved over about 12 years ago. But it's a recent travel just to Europe, nowhere too exotic. Okay, so no recent travel, no significant recent travel anywhere. Okay, and are you coughing up anything other than, so you're not coughing up blood or anything like that? No. Good. And are you feeling feverish, hot, cold, sweaty? Yeah, so a little bit feverish at first, so the first three or so days of this, but then the fever's gone away. Okay. In general do you feel better? Yeah, I was just going to say also had a bit of a headache Like headaches that come and go rather but like right now it's fine Okay, and in general would you say you're feeling you're beginning to feel better worse or sort of staying the same? So it's like it's up and down so so let's see So I started last week and I stayed home from work two days this week I think it was maybe Tuesday and Thursday so like I felt better and then worse again and then better and then worse again so it's been a kind of constant but constant in being variable okay and I just need to ask any other sort of risk factors that you may have so no sort of significant weight loss or unexplained weight loss any watchers So no weight loss but I have been losing my appetite recently and I mean I usually eat a lot so I enjoy eating as well but like that's been a bit concerning you've been using your appetite recently yes and you're a little bit concerned about that but you haven't you haven't lost any weight that you think no not that and any sort of rashes or anything and you all right okay so I would ask to examine you now but I I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat at least see if there's a probably we can try oh no well no it's okay I think about doing it have you got any lumps or bumps bumps around your neck that you can feel? No. Not the, no, okay. And so finally you were talking about, I mean it sounds to me that you've been a little bit up and down, sore throat, developed a dry cough, you are slightly short of breath but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of the consultation now, is if you feel significantly worse if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness or breathlessness that you are concerned about and I would advise you to see a GP and actually see something physically but I think for now I can sort of try and reassure you that if this clears up as I expect it would so expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days um if it's not please get in touch with the medical professional again um and uh i would expect it to and so therefore i wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis um your concerns about lung cancer are was that the other thing you concerned about oh yeah yeah so so um again if you're not getting better please see somebody again. I've just got four seconds now so nice talking to you and we've got to we got to tidy up yeah okay so and I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days of work and paracetamol lots of fluids and rest up and as I say if you're not feeling better please get in touch okay all right so have a good day thank you all right
