there's no delays. Hello. Hi there. Hello there. Thanks for being here. Before we go further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Yes, it's Adriana Katrangieva and I'm a 26-year-old. Okay, Adriana, how can I help you this afternoon? Well, I have this like really crazy headache that's been going on for a few days and it really annoys me okay when when did it exactly start this headache around three days ago maybe three days ago okay and where about in your head is this pain it's basically like it kind of feels all over my head but like mainly around my right eye okay and it's a headache there all the time or does it come and go? It kind of comes and goes but I mean it is there all the time but like sometimes it's stronger. Okay so it comes and goes. Okay and if I was to ask you on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst type of pain you ever had, how would you rate this headache? It's probably an 8. Great and if I was to ask you to describe the headache to me in terms the nature of the pain is it sharp is it dull is it crampy is it throbbing um it's kind of it's dull but sometimes it gets a bit sharper so basically it like it developed gradually i guess it's like the first day it just started when i was at work and by the end of the day it was like pretty pretty like it was a lot basically and then i was thinking okay maybe i'll I'll just go to sleep and I woke up the next morning like it was even even worse basically So you think the headache is getting worse at last three days? Yeah, okay. Have you tried anything which made a headache better? So I tried Ibuprofen and so I took like a few and For the last two days Basically, it doesn't really help know in the past didn't help me which is why I decided to try it Except the headaches, any other symptoms at all? For example any problems with your eyesight or your vision Not really but just when it started I got this like weird shooting lights and like now like light is quite annoying my eyes When you say annoying does it hurt to look at bright lights? Yeah, yeah it hurts. Okay and have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision? Not loss of vision I wouldn't say, it's just like some lights from shooting lights basically. Any nausea or any vomiting? Um, well I'm like basically I'm sick with the headache but no vomiting. When you say sick you mean you feel sick, okay. Yeah. Yeah, no vomiting, okay. Any neck pain or neck stiffness? No. Okay, and any difficulty with speaking or speech? No. Any difficulty with weakness in your arms and legs? No, it's hard to focus though, so I had to take a couple of days off work actually. Oh really? Okay, okay. Well, I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on. Any recent head injuries at all? No. Okay, and have you had anything like this before in the past? Yeah, I mean headaches you mean? Or similar to this kind of headache? Yeah, I mean I had, but usually after I take ibuprofen it kind of goes away, but this time it's just not. Okay, alright. Any temperatures or fevers? No. Any rashes at all on your skin? No, not that I've noticed. Okay, and just moving forward, are you otherwise fit and well, Adriana? Am I what, sorry? Are you fit and well? Do you have any other medical history? I think so, it's just a headache. Any history of migraines at all? Not myself, I've never had a migraine, but my sister and my mum have them quite frequently. Okay, fine, I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask, do you take any regular medication? No. Are you on the pill? No. Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medications? Not that I know of. Okay so you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines Yeah Is that normally well controlled or are they having difficulty controlling the symptoms So my sister like better like it kind of very rare but my mom is like quite bad Usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that, it takes her out for a few days basically. Okay, fine. Socially, tell me a bit more about your life outside of work. Who lives at home with you? I live with housemates, so three of them. Excellent. And are you working at the moment? You mentioned this is impacting your work. Yeah, so I work in IT, so I work with computers a lot, so it kind of is difficult to focus. I had to like reduce the brightness of my screen. Do you wear glasses? Yes I do. Have you had any recent eye tests? No, I've been wearing them since I was five years old. Bear in mind if you feel like your eyes are straining, I always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Have you been more stressed or anxious at work recently? Well, it's been a bit stressful kicking off a new project, but yeah, nothing out of the ordinary really. Okay, all right, great. Regarding smoking or alcohol, do you drink or smoke at all? I socially smoke and I drink, not only socially. Okay. Right. Now, Adriana, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Have you read anything online or spoken to people? Not really. At first I thought it's stress or maybe I didn't drink enough water because sometimes when I don't drink enough water, I get headaches. but I don't think that's it and I'm like worried it's I don't want it to be a migraine because I know what it's like from my mom and my sister and it's really annoying so I really don't want to have that and I know it's genetic so I've researched that but I don't know if that is the case so yeah is there anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today yeah maybe just kind of if you have any recommendations of I can take something stronger because apparently ibuprofen doesn help me usually it gets resolved if I have headache and like after like one or two days but currently it didn help me meet tablets you take a little bit three a day three a day okay all right so Adriana so really what I think is going on here I unfortunately do you think this could be a headache very similar to a migraine. The reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it, given your mum and your sister also have migraines. I think it's something for us to think about. Now, I'm not saying it's going to keep happening, but it may just be a one-off. But it's certainly worth treating it today with some stronger analgesia or painkillers. Now, moving forward, we have some options which we can discuss. You try the ibuprofen. Now, my only worry is I'm not sure whether you're taking the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets three times a day. Oh, right. There's definitely room for improvement there. Or I can prescribe you something stronger like naproxen, which is another anti-inflammatory, which can be helpful. We can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or codeine, which might be helpful as well. Yeah, I think routine is what my mum takes for when she has migraines. Okay, I think it's only worth looking into, as I can give you a prescription for that today. With regards to the next few days, it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's, if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse. And I'd like you to come back and see me in about a week's time, week to two weeks' time. If you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches, we can think about giving you medications as prophylactic, which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis. But we can have that discussion next time. Okay. Okay. In the meantime, if your headaches aren't getting any better or they're getting worse, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner, okay? Okay, yeah. If you have any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs or you're just not feeling very well, just give me a call and come back and see me. Okay. All right? Great. Great, well, have a good day. Thank you, you too. Bye. Bye.
