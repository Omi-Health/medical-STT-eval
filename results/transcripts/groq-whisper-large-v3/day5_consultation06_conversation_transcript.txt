No, because I've not got one, but to the touch I'm literally roasting. Okay, and any nausea or vomiting? Yes, I've been throwing up. I can't seem to be able to keep anything in me, not even water, not even my tea, not even any liquid stuff, I've just been throwing up everything. okay and when when were you last sick um i was sick just after trying trying to have breakfast this morning so maybe about two hours ago okay and have you been passing water okay yeah i've been i've been yeah urinating okay is that what you mean like yeah yeah urinating yeah any and what sort of color is the urine to be honest i can't know how to look so i really could Okay And when did you last pass urine do you think At least an hour ago Okay and any blood in the stool or in the urine that you've noticed? No blood. Okay any episodes like this before? How's your bowels normally? Sorry I didn't catch that. How's your bowels normally? My bowels are normally fine, I normally go to the toilet every day. Any episodes of diarrhoea or constipation normally? No. And is there anything you think might have triggered this off? Have you been abroad anywhere? No, but then my brother has actually been having similar symptoms for the past few days as well. And he does say like everyone in school is Scottish. So I don't know, that might be from him. So you've been in contact with him, have you? Yes. Okay. And any other medical problems? None that I'm aware of. Have you had any other symptoms at the moment like rash? No, no rash, no nothing. Okay, any surgery before or abdominal problems or any other medical issues? Well apart from the fact that this one is giving me abdominal pains, no previous abdominal pains before. Obviously I get the odd you know menstrual cramps and all that but you know that's you know that comes and goes. Okay and whereabouts is the pain that you're getting? It's kind of like towards my navel area like I can't touch my navel area it's just so sore and it gets yeah towards like the center of my navel. And does the pain come and go? Yes it does come when it comes I feel the strong urge to go to the to the loo and then sort of releases me and sort of like comes again it comes and goes. Okay and do you take any medication regularly? Well I take my vitamins, I take vitamin D every day that's about all that I regularly take. And have you got a normal diet? Yeah I eat well normally. Right do you smoke or or drink alcohol? Well, I don't smoke for, you know, I have a pint from time to time And do you take any other drugs No like I said I only take vitamins For my menstrual cramps when it comes maybe I might take an ibuprofen just to ease the pain And when was your last period? Two weeks ago. Okay, are you on any contraception? No. Are you having regular sexual intercourse? No. Okay. And what's your job? I'm a graphics designer. Have you had to miss work because of this problem? Well yes I've had to actually work from home today. I'm working from home today because I can't be out for work. Okay and who do you live with at home? I live with my brother and my mum. Okay and have you tried anything yourself for this problem? Well I've tried a home remedy, I've tried the ORS you know thing I bought from my local... Can you just repeat that the ORS the salt sugar ORS mix the salt sugar mix okay and how often have you been taking that I've taken that I've taken that like three times a day for the past two days okay and and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off or getting worse? To be honest, they're not getting any better because like I said I've been vomiting literally everything I take so I doubt that even that has had the chance to work. Okay. I mean it sounds like because your brother's had a similar thing it sounds like it might be some an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got which is usually caused by a virus but it can be from something you've eaten as well. If the symptoms they do normally start to settle by themselves with your rehydration salts, if the symptoms are continuing to get worse the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough. Sometimes you do require certain medication to help this if it sometimes if it caused by a bacteria What I would say probably worth as it been going on for a few days and you feel like it not starting to ease off I think it probably important to get a sample of the stool so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection that needs specific treatment. OK. And we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated, because if you're not keeping fluid down, you can get dehydrated. How do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even like drink water I'm throwing up everything? Yeah so you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts it's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago so you're obviously still hydrated enough to pass urine but we should see you so that we can check your hydration and get that sample sent off as soon as possible because if you come into the clinic you can send that sample off straight away otherwise we would have to post it out to you which would take time. Okay so when can I come to the clinic to have this done? So we can we can make you an urgent appointment and then you can you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration but if in the meantime you're feeling more unwell then we would get you seen urgently in A&E. okay so you could call us back in the meantime okay so what i'll do yeah if you could please book me the appointment and then yeah i'll see how i feel um before the end of the day hopefully i don't need to go to any keep drinking keep going with the rehydration salts with tiny sips constantly to say that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and you vomit so just tiny tiny sips but just keep going with it um and just have very simple food if you're going to have anything like toast or biscuit or something really light like that avoid um fruit vegetables and milk anything like that which might just make it worse okay okay so you're happy to book an appointment through the support line yes please right okay we'll do that for you okay take care thank you thanks bye
