Did you have to miss school? Yeah, occasionally. Okay. And when do you think it lasts? When do you think that asthma stopped? At what age did you get to the point where you weren taking medication anymore A few years ago like three or four years ago I think yeah And so this time how did it start? Did you have any other symptoms? Any chest pain, temperature, cold symptoms, anything like that? Yeah, so I have cough and cough a lot and I have a fever. I also used to walk to work but recently I can't because it's a feel like very short of breath and sometimes I feel like I can't even finish saying a sentence. It's quite difficult to complete the talking sometimes, yeah, occasionally. Right. Have you coughed any phlegm up or anything like that? No. Any blood in there when you cough? No, I don't think so. Okay, and any chest pain? No chest pain, no. Have you been woken up at night time at all? No, just daytime working, yeah. Have you been able to do any exercise? No, I can't. Okay, and do you have a peak flow meter at home? where you measure your breathing sorry you have what's called a peak flow meter which you breathe into to get a score on your breathing no no and you normally take any asthma inhalers over the last few years yes you do I see you said you stopped them three to four years ago oh when I had asthma I used to take this Okay, how about over the last three to four years? Yeah. Have you taken any medication? I took Zobutamo. Okay, so you normally take that, do you? Or was that just recently? Normally, yeah. Okay, and how often do you normally need it? Every few weeks, I'm not sure. Okay What about when you exercise normally do you have to use medication inhalers Yeah yeah a bit Pardon Yeah Okay And do you take any other medications No, nothing else. Any other medical problems? I have a hay fever as well. Okay. Do you take anything for that? No. And any allergies to medications? No, no allergies. Do you smoke? No, I don't smoke. Do you drink any alcohol regularly? Yeah, one glass. How often? One glass of what? One glass of wine. Every, how often did you say? Every two or three days, defense yeah and who do you live with at home yeah who do you live with at home yeah who do you live with do you live on your own or do you live with i live with my partner okay and what's your job day to day uh i'm an engineer and have you been at work in the last few days no i can't because i used to work or work to work but recently i i work from home or sometimes i take sick leave yeah okay and when at the moment are you um feeling short of breath when you're sitting still or just walk just walk or sometimes but currently i feel i feel well are you able to get up and down the stairs okay yeah right okay um and did you say you were finding it hard to complete your sentences? Yeah sometimes. Okay. Yeah, like this, yeah. Right, okay. I mean it sounds like you've had a flare-up of your asthma, it could be triggered by if there's more pollen around or there may be, you may have a viral infection causing it to get worse. Did you say you checked your temperature already Yes I checked Was it normal Yeah yeah What was your temperature 37 yeah Okay that fine Have you got an asthma inhaler at home? Yeah. Okay. So what I would suggest is you take it more regularly than you are doing at the moment. Have you got a spacer at home? Do you want to show me how to do it or somehow? Do you have a spacer at home? No. Okay. What I can do is I can prescribe you a peak flow meter so we can check your breathing level and a spacer to use your inhaler a bit more efficiently, which the pharmacist can show you how you use that when you pick it up. Yeah, sure. And if you increase it so you're taking it two to four puffs, like every four hours initially and if you get a high temperature or your wheezing is getting worse you need to call us back straight away so we can just advise you further with that okay and it would be a good idea when you're feeling better if we could arrange just a review to see how your asthma is because we may need to start some other medication for you okay sounds good you can arrange a review in a week or so um but but before that and if you're if you're feeling worse in a week right okay okay and the other thing to do would be to take a regular antihistamine which you can get from the pharmacy i can put a question on your notes about what to take Yeah, that would be helpful. And then when you get the peak flow meter, the pharmacist can show you how to use it, and if you could record a value first thing when you wake up in the evening over the next week, and then we can discuss that over the phone when we look at the figures and see whether you need to go on another inhaler as well. Oh, awesome. Thank you. Have you got any questions? No, that's fine. Yeah. Thank you very much thanks a lot bye
