Okay and can you just tell me about how it started, what were you doing when it came on? Yeah just since yesterday morning since I woke up really, just yeah kind of throbbing I haven't really wanted to leave the house much since then. Okay and whereabouts in your head is the pain? Mainly on the left side. Okay what does it feel like? It just kind of feels like it's throbbing, it's quite intense, sort of comes and goes, yeah quite sensitive to light. When you say it comes and goes does it completely go away? Just kind of fade, so it's still there a little bit but it kind of gets more or less severe. Okay and any other symptoms that you've had, any problems with your eyes or your eyesight? No not at all. Any abnormal smell or taste? No. Any nausea, vomiting? No, no I've been feeling fine actually. And have you been eating and drinking okay? Yes, yes same as normal. Okay and normally do you get any headaches No not really It not something I ever had before Okay And has it occurred at a particular time in your menstrual cycle No, not particularly. My period was about a week ago. Right, okay. And how were you the day before it came on? Have you had any other symptoms like feeling feverish, temperature any runny nose sore ears no not really any sort of cold symptoms I was feeling okay the day before okay and at the moment how are you feeling um it's still pretty bad um yeah still kind of bobbing yeah have you had any changes in your skin no skin's been fine have you checked your temperature at all you've got a thermometer at home um I haven't um I don't feel like I'm feverish but I haven't checked. And any problems with weakness, tingling, numbness in your arms or legs? No not at all. And what have you been doing since it came on? Have you been able to go to work or have you been at home? Taking some painkillers, mainly been at home, yeah just kind of kind of seems to be worse when I'm in a light room or like sunlight so I've kind of been staying in as much as possible. Okay does it get worse with any position that you're in? Is it worse when you lie flat or when you bend forward? No I think I've generally been lying down, it's better that way. Any problems if you cough or sneeze? No I haven't really got a cough or anything. Okay can you just tell me a bit about your medical history in the past, have you had any significant medical problems, any hospital admissions, operations and things like that? No not recently nothing. Do you take any medication? No, just contraception. And which contraception do you take Microgynon When did you start that one About six years ago Do you get any side effects from it Not really no not too much Okay and anyone in your family had any medical problems? My mum had high blood pressure and she's got a history of migraines and it's definitely affected me before. And have you had your blood pressure checked for recently? I haven't actually no. Have you had it checked when you've had the repeat prescription done? Yeah so probably about six months ago. Do you know if there's been any problems with it? It's always been fine I think. Okay and whereabouts do you live at the moment? Who do you live with at home? Just with health mates, just friends. Okay do you drink much alcohol day to day? A day normal amount, probably a few drinks at the weekend. Okay, do you smoke? No. Do you take any other drugs of any sort? No. So what tablets have you been taking already? Sorry? What tablets have you been taking already for it? Just paracetamol. I'm allergic to aspirin so I haven't been taking that. What happens when you take aspirin? I just feel really sick. Okay and have you ever taken any non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen, naproxen, anything like that? I have in the past, I haven't been taking it for the last few days. Okay, so this headache is new to you and you've not had regular headaches before? Yeah. What I would suggest is taking some anti-inflammatories along with the paracetamol. Okay You said you eating okay Yeah yeah fine I mean from the sounds of it it does sound quite like a migraine but obviously even had no history of that in the past and and is anything changed recently or any anything you've done recently might triggered it I'm not like a think of I been a bit stressed out work that kind of thing yeah and well that would be the first thing to do is to take some anti-inflammatories along with the paracetamol make sure you're really well hydrated and see how that goes and if it isn't settling or it's getting worse or you get any other change in your headache or you're unwell with it with a high temperature then we would certainly need to speak to you straight away about that the other thing is if you if you're getting persistent headaches or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle or certain things seem to trigger these headaches then it would be worth having a further discussion about it to see whether we can work out if we can help that longer term. Okay brilliant thank you. I would try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked if you haven't had it checked for a while. Okay. The thing to do is to have a thermometer at home so you can make sure that your temperature is okay. Yep. If you have a raised temperature or your headache is just getting worse and you develop any rashes or anything like that, then we'd need to speak to you straight away. Yep, okay, that's brilliant. Okay, so I'll text my boyfriend and I'll hopefully be a bit better in a day or two then, so yeah. Okay, so have you got any other questions? No, that was it today. Okay. Okay, then we'll speak to you again. Okay, brilliant. Thanks so much. Thank you so much. Bye. Bye.
