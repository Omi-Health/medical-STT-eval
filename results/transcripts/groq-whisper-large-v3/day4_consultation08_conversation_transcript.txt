Hello. Hi there. Hi. Hi there. My name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors at Babel. Can I confirm your name, please? Hi there. Yeah. My name is Brian. Sorry. Your name was? Name was Brian. Brian. Hi, Brian. Nice to meet you. And your date of birth? Yeah, my date of birth is the 8th of August 1982. Great. And are you in a sort of confidential place where you can speak freely? Yeah, no one else can hear me. Great, and you're happy to continue with the consultation? Yes. Fabulous. Okay, so how can I help today? Yeah, so basically it's just been happening over the last few weeks or so. but I don't really feel like getting up in the morning is really difficult and I don't have much energy at all during the day. Often, yeah, just like doing most things that I would normally find easy, it's become quite difficult. Okay, so things have become quite difficult for you. Yeah. Is there anything else? It's quite hard to say. Things like I'm not eating very much at the moment. I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy. Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had difficulty waking up, no energy, not eating. That's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks, do you mean two or three or five? Now I think about it maybe even longer. I guess it might be related to it, so I also started a new job slightly recently. It might have even coincided with that job a couple of months ago. When did you start your new job? Two months ago you say? Yeah. so this has been going on perhaps for sort of six weeks or so. More like two months I would say, yeah. Okay all right so is there anything that you're particularly sort of concerned about or hoping to get out of this consultation? Well I know that it's not really normal for me. So before this phase started happening, you know, I wouldn't have any problems sort of eating what I want to eat or you know doing standard things in life And what I want to do is to like kind of return to that previous state somehow I not sure how that is what what the best way is doing that after you know give some advice or whatever that'd be really useful okay sure okay um well what I'd like to do is just ask you a few more sort of questions around what's been going on and also around your background health and things like that and then we can go on to sort of what can be done from there is that right okay okay great so you say you've been feeling unwell with not a lot of energy difficult waking up in the mornings do you tend to just on that note do you tend to wake up early and then stay in bed in the morning actually I'm just not normally wake up early it's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all probably. I think that's probably close. There's difficulty sleeping as well. Yeah. And have you, how has your mood been over this period? Have you been feeling... Distracted, I'd say. I kind of, yeah, finding it really hard to quite difficulty focusing. I I would say. Not unhappy or happy, but just quite not focused. Okay, so difficulty focusing, quite distracted. And would you say you've been in good spirits or is your mood low? Actually, now you mentioned it, like my mood is a bit lower recently and so I've noticed like my sex drive has kind of decreased a bit over the past few months as well. So yeah. And so lower mood, decreased sex drive recently as well and just on that note, just a few questions around that. Are you able to, maybe slightly personal questions but if you're okay to answer these. Do you tend to have morning erections like you, is that something that you've noticed? I haven't noticed anything like that specifically. So you're saying you have not noticed morning erections and usually you would, it's a normal thing to have waking up with something but you have not noticed those recently? I have not noticed those recently. Okay, and that's been a change, has it? Um, important one, I don't think. Sorry? I don think it an important change no So you don think there been a change there No there hasn been a change there Okay sorry right Okay so Just going back to the mood symptoms as well Yeah you had difficulty focusing, easily distracted, your mood has been slightly lower with lower sex drive. Yeah. And in what way is your sex drive being lower? Are you in a relationship at the moment? Yeah, I'm married. I've been for many years and yeah just over the last few months just in dissent is interested okay so are you phrase there for a moment and so less interested as well okay and just to ask you a few questions before we wrap up is any significant past medical history so do you suffer from any mental health problems in the past or any physical health problems? So in the past I have a history of hypothyroidism. Hypo? Hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism? yeah that's high thyroid just to sort of confirm it sorry can you say that again please hyper as in high hyper thyroid hypo hypo okay hypothyroid thank you thank you um yeah and uh also in the past i mean i haven't had any kind of specific uh medical diagnoses along these lines um but the suspicion that it may have had an impact on me but my father has committed suicide about 15 years ago okay okay and um do you take any medications I have a drug history of thyroxine, so maybe, yes. Do you continue to take thyroxine now? Yes. You do? So you're taking thyroxine at the moment? Yes. Cool. Any drug allergies? Are you allergic to any medications? No, I have no medication allergies. No. No allergies. And you mentioned the suicide of your father 15 years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other significant family history of medical conditions or psychiatric conditions? No No depression or anything like that running in your family No nothing Okay And your mother is well Any brothers or sisters Yeah, she's fine. And I'm an only child. Okay. So I just, sorry, my slightly random question, but any change in your vision? No, no. Nothing like that. No changing moods. Okay, and just to go back to your, you were saying you had low mood. Some people who do have low mood and low sex drive can sometimes feel suicidal as well. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else? No. No? No, not really. And are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities that you have done in the past? Sometimes. I mean I guess most of the activities but when I've been doing sports as well I find sometimes it's quite difficult to breathe so I have some kind of like shortness of breath when doing sports compared to maybe a couple of months ago okay so you've become more short of breath over the last few months yeah and and you've had, okay, so any other things around this, more fatigue, more shortness of breath over the last few months with a lower mood, decreased sex drive. Just before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like to talk about? No, nothing specific. So, getting a little bit towards the end now, but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you. I would like to probably see you in person and do an examination and also we'd probably like to do some blood tests as well. So, do you think it'd be possible to see to book an appointment in the next few days with your GP or that would be ideal I think here and then we can probably do some more do an examination and do some investigations ready to see what's going on a little bit more that makes sense yeah is that right yeah it's very useful thank you okay better to have some kind of plan. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think I definitely think we need a plan here. It's been nice talking to you, I'm sorry we run out of time now, but we've at least started the ball rolling with some further investigations and tests. I'm glad that you're, you know, although you have a low mood, you're not feeling suicidal, just to confirm that, and you'll hopefully get to the bottom of some of your tiredness and your other symptoms. Let me see. Okay? Thank you very much for taking the time. Okay. Thank you. Thanks.
