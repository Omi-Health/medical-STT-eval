Fine. I think with the abdominal pain as it's getting worse and it's been going on for the last few days, it would be very helpful to be able to examine you properly. Would you be happy to have an examination with the doctor? Yes. Okay. So what we can do is we can arrange a face-to-face examination where they can see you in a clinic and do an abdominal examination and advise further from them when we've got more of an idea what's causing the problem. Would you be happy to call the support line and arrange that appointment? Yes. OK, that's fine. So we'll do that. In the meantime, if it gets a lot worse or you're not holding any fluids down, then we should see you before then. Did you say your pregnancy test was a month ago? Yes. Okay and your Implanon was just put in a year ago? Yes. The other thing we would need to do is to do a pregnancy test today if possible? I would do it. So if you can do that today and if it's positive we need to see you straight away so it gives a call back. Yes. Okay, have you got any other questions? Right, okay. So if you call the support line and make an appointment we'll go from there. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.
