Hello. Hi, good morning. Good morning, Kim. How can I help you this morning? So I'm having some pain in my tummy, like the lower part of my tummy. Okay. And I'm just feeling quite hot and sweaty. Right, I'm sorry to hear that. When did your symptoms all start? About two days ago. all start? About two days ago. Okay and where about in the tummy is the pain exactly? Like below my belly button. It's like quite sore when I press on it. Okay. Did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual? So-so. It hasn't been, it's more gradual and it's just it's getting a bit worse now. Okay, okay. And can you describe the pain to me? It's kind of like a, I guess a burning pain, and it's just right there in that spot, like that's mostly where I'm feeling it. It hasn't spread anywhere else. Just below your belly button you mentioned? Yeah. Okay. And is the pain constant or does it come and go? It's really constant, it's like getting worse, it's not like I can still move and walk around, I mean I'm still kind of functioning, it's just I'm aware of it all the time. Okay and with the pain have you noticed any other symptoms at all? So for example let's focus first on your bowels, are your bowels working okay? Yeah I had a bit of constipation but that's better now, that was like since last week. Okay, so you've got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose stools? No, my bowel movements are normal now. Okay, and what about your waterworks? Are you passing urine okay? Yeah, that's fine. I did notice that the urine was a little pink in colour, but it hasn't really been burning specifically or hurting when I pee. And I did notice I was peeing more regularly, but I have been drinking lots of fluids so I wasn sure if that was related to the pain When you mentioned pink urine was there any blood at all in your urine or is it difficult to say I can say I mean maybe Okay, alright, but otherwise it doesn't hurt or sting when you pass urine? I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that, just that I'm peeing more than more regularly. Okay and moving up towards other symptoms have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all? Just a little nauseous but no vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers? I haven't really, I felt a bit hot and sweaty but I haven't really measured it so I can't really say. Okay fine and Kim do you have to ask or female patients. It's just questions about your cycle, if you don't mind me asking. Are you currently sexually active? Yeah, I've had the same partner. We were last sexually active about four days ago. My last STD screen was normal, which was about six months ago. Okay, so you've had no other partners since then? No other partners since then. Okay, and do you use any contraception at all? I'm on the Implanon, I had the Implanon inserted about a year ago. Okay, fine. Are you still having periods? Yes. When was your last period? My last period was about three weeks ago, I mean two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, okay. So is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implement in bed, is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? It's up to us to think about potentially. Well, we don't use any other barrier methods. So we just use the, I just have the Implanon and the SAM partner. Theoretically, if the Implanon hasn't been working, then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect it. Okay. Well, it's something for us to think about. Maybe we'll have to do a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that. Okay. And so just to summarise so far, if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple of days, this tummy pain has really affected you, mainly lower down towards your belly button. It's quite burning. you said is getting worse you know some pink urine but no burning or stinging pain when you posture and your bowels are working okay you felt a bit bit nauseous and feeling hot and sweaty Have I got that all right Yeah that sounds very accurate Is there anything else perhaps you feel like you should share with me at this stage which you think might be important? I don't think so, I think we've covered everything that's really bothering me. Yeah okay, tell me a bit more about your medical history otherwise, are you normally fitting well? Yeah, quite well. I haven't had any surgical, I don't have any surgical history. I don't have any previous, I haven't had any operations before and I'm not on any other medication, I just had the implant. Okay. Have you had anything like this before in the past, any similar symptoms? I've never had these symptoms before. No, okay. Fine. Any other family history I should be aware of? Anything relevant family related to the bowels, maybe related to gyne history? No, not that I'm aware of, no. Okay, all right. And socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? I live in a share house with two other roommates. Okay. And are you currently working? Yeah, I am currently working. What do you do for work? I am an accountant. Okay. Grace, okay. Do you smoke at all, Kim? No. No? And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Socially I drink, but I don't think more than normal. normal okay just before I go to examination just want to go through just some few screening questions that's okay yes or no we've covered majority of them already but just make sure I'm not missing anything else how's your how's your chest how's your breathing okay any funny heartbeats or rhythm palpitations Nothing no Okay any headaches any problems with your vision No No okay alright Fine okay So really just moving on So based on your story really Kim it a difficult one We know you got some primary pain We don exactly know what causing it It could be a few different things that could be causing your pain could just be a you know it could just be a urine infection for example could this be something related to guts could this be something related to your you know a pregnancy related cause and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out what's going on here which I can organize for you today okay and the base on those tests we will have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed but certainly if it's been going on for last couple of days you know it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for it maybe your infection and so it's an act can we do that instead of me going for tests and then seeing how that goes yeah absolutely so I think it's certainly worth you know covering you with some antibodies today but I still want you to bear in mind you know having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here and um and i want to kind of really come back and see him in a few days time if your symptoms are not getting any better or indeed they're getting worse so things to look out for would be you know worse than tummy pain um if you're feeling really hot and sweaty the temperature's not coming down um vomiting etc does that make sense yeah i think i'm happy with that plan okay you can try just regular painkillers paracetamol will be advisable make sure you drink plenty of fluids you can try some cranberry juice as well which can sometimes help with your urine symptoms take the antibiotics and give me a call you know if you are worried about anything else uh sure that sounds great thank you very much um should i just collect the script at my pharmacy Yeah, by sending it straight to your pharmacy, start your antibiotics today, something called trimethoprine. We'll take two tablets, one tablet twice a day for three days. Okay, great. That sounds great. Let's hear you get on. Okay, thank you very much. Great. All the best. Bye. Bye-bye.
