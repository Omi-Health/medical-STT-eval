Hi there, good morning. Hello, good morning. I'm Dr. Dean Mirza from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Okay, before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth? Yes, my name is John Smith and I was born on the 5th of April 1973. Okay, that's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes, absolutely. great okay so um tell me a bit about what's been happening you said you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow yeah I just noticed this like about a week ago or something I like a weird swelling on my elbow I noticed that when I was in the shower it's not painful at all I feel fine but it's just just a bit a bit weird to see that it's it's slightly warm and I kind of feel like this it's a bit fluid in inside so you know what's going on so did you say it was the left elbow the right elbow it's the left elbow left okay and have you banged that elbow do you have any kind of injury no No, not really. Not that I know of. I haven't noticed anything. I can actually like, move it normally. It's just, I can just see that it feels a bit strange. Sure, okay. And in terms of your job, do you do anything physical? Not really, no. I just, you know, sit at the desk. Right. Okay. And has this happened before? No, no I haven't noticed that before. I don't have any history of seeing this, I don't remember. Sure, okay. And can I just double check, has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that? Well I do Well I think I have something like osteoarthritis It sometimes kind of hurts my joints but in my family I'm not sure. Okay, sure. So you said you think you've got osteoarthritis, has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis? Yes, a few years ago. Okay, was that a GP or a specialist or is it physiotherapy? A GP. GP, okay, all right. Rick, can I just double check how old you are please? I'm 53. 53, okay, fantastic, all right. And do you have any other illnesses at all? Well, not really, you know, I'm allergic to peanuts. and what let's play yeah I'd say but may okay cool oh yeah are you allergic to any medication and no not that I know of sure and do you are you on any medication on a regular basis and no okay and you normally fit and well mobile active I do I do do some sports I run regularly like two three times a week yeah no I'm I think I'm healthy good well done that's good that you're doing on regular basis okay and can I is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now yes sure okay compare with me one second right okay and if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that a bit higher so i can just see the underside okay fantastic all right and then just bring it around to this side essentially i can see the other side okay fantastic all right and if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers there's is it is it hot compared to the surrounding skin the adjacent skin it's a bit warm yes it's a bit warmer okay um and um is it very tender when you pressing on that now because if you give it a press does it hurt you at all On the tip of the elbow it okay Just like next to it like where the swelling is it a bit yeah it feels a bit fluid Okay. All right. I noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow. Do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body? No, not really. I have more skin. Do you suffer from eczema at all? No. No. All right. Okay, so what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem, okay, is I think it would be worthwhile, this seems like what we call the bursitis, okay, so that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. What I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication in the first instance. And as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done. to check for other types of causes of joint swelling. Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some blood test forms to be sent out to your house and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done. And that will involve you having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies. So we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well. The time frame for that will be, the results will come back to us after about five or six days from now. It will take time for the forms to come out to you and if you get the forms, the test time is straight away. By the time that we're expecting a result back, one or two days after that, we're looking at maybe six days. And what I would suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you in one of of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood tests, and we can get a gauge as to what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now, it doesn't look like to me like something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So we are worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint and your joint doesn look like that however if your the elbow was to become very red very painful and the redness was to spread or become you know more intense then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment more immediate treatment okay do you think it's something dangerous like something like could i take from that or is it no i don't think this is anything dangerous i don't need to worry okay what i'm doing is i'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop okay so if we go to work this this is not the case right now right now it looks quite straightforward it's nothing's sinister or life-threatening um what i'm doing is i'm just saying in case things worse than these are the things that we'll be looking out for and this is what you have to do but you don't have that now thankfully and i don't think you're going to have it but i'm just saying the what-if scenario is that okay yeah that that sounds good thank you all right did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me um well just yeah i just wanted to know about this um yeah it feels a bit better now to know that okay all right yeah no that's it Thank you. Okay, so I would take ibuprofen regularly, okay, you can get that over the counter, that's 400 milligrams two times a day and you should take that after food, not on an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it, okay? Sure. All right, so what I want to do is I'll get the form sent out to you and we are going to arrange a follow-up appointment, maybe within a, actually you know the following appointment doesn't have to be face-to-face, it's more convenient to do it over the phone, we can do that over the phone, over video, you can do that as well, that's your call, but you contact us after you've had the blood test done and we can review things then, okay? Okay, yeah, that sounds good, I'll do that and if I see that it's getting worse, I'll probably ask for a physical appointment. Sure, sure, that's a good idea. All right then, okay, take care then, so just leave that with me, I'll sort all those bits and pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll review you after the test, things go well. Thank you, Alright, take care, all the best. Bye bye. Bye.
