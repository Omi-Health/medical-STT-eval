So on your skin is there any of the patches sore areas You mentioned it quite sore Is it weeping Is it like watery liquid coming from that area Weeping No. Nothing that you notice. Okay. Right. Some of the areas are cracked. Yeah. So you have cracks over there. Okay. And is there any scratch marks on any of the, you know, areas? Any scratch marks? I mean, it's very itchy, so I scratch myself, but there's no scratch marks. Okay. Is there any thickened skin? Like, you know, where the skin is very thick and darkened areas? No. No, I don't think so. Okay. Right here. So you've mentioned you've got a history of eczema. So what do you do about it? How do you keep it under control? Usually I use a cream called Deprobate. In the shower I use something called Thermal. Dermal, alright. And have you been using them recently or not? Yes, yes I use them. You use them every day? Yes, there's no change in that. I didn't change any. Okay. Have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema? Ummm, I'm not sure. Yes, yes I have. you but it's not helping yeah you're still using the steroids yeah I tried I tried which one are you using the steroids what's the name I'm not sure the post is not there okay so is it like the over-the-counter ones sorry over hydrocortisone that does that ring up yeah so you using the hydrocortisone yeah are you using any antihistamines at all uh no no no antihistamines okay right fine otherwise other than the rash you're feeling well in yourself there's no temperature no joint pains yeah you don't know but i've tried those on system and it didn't work you've tried the antihistamines and didn't work okay which one did you try the one over the counter okay so like cetrosine yeah yeah okay that's fine right okay so from what you're describing it looks like you know it is quite widespread your eczema yeah because you're having it all over your chest and hands and things like that um so do you have any allergies to any medication at all no no allergies no allergies okay and you don't other than eczema you don't have any other medical condition i i have asthma and in my family there is a hypothyroidism and migraine my mother has migraine my mother has migraine and what was the other one i didn't understand who has hypothyroidism my mother okay so she has hypothyroidism okay that's fine right here you mentioned you have asthma so what medications are you using for asthma um uh you know probably nailer the blue halo so you don't you don't use it every day so you just use it on and off yeah yeah yeah blue inhalers but your breathing's all okay yeah okay yeah yeah it's only when i have a flare so what we need to do is obviously you got extents as i mentioned so extensive eczema what we do it need a couple of things because to keep you a bit comfortable will you would probably need some histamines which I'm going to prescribe also hydrocortisone is a baby steroids that you use for young children you might probably need a bit more stronger one like betnawit or something like that okay so we'll try that first so I'm going to give it's called the anti-histamine it's called hexafenadine and then we will try with some betna weight first so it's like very small amount like it's like one fingertip yeah this much is is enough to cover your palms and your back of your hands yeah so it's very small amount so that if you can imagine you can cover with very small amount the whole body yeah so use that you have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks okay okay if if there's no improvement you need to get back to us or if you have any kind of adverse reaction like an allergic reaction which is unlikely but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us okay okay so what we're going to do is we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy it looks like boots on the systems is that correct yeah yes yes so I'll send it across to boots and it will be there for collect collecting if things are getting worse in the next two weeks call us beforehand otherwise wait for two weeks take the medication and the cream you still need to continue on your emollients like the dermal soap and as well as the depravated yeah so you still need to use those in the interim any questions at all no no questions thank you you take care then bye bye now thank you bye bye
