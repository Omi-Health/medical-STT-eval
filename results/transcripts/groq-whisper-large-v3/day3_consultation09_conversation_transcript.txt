Hi! Hello, hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Hi. Hi. So, just before we start, is it alright if you could confirm your name for me, please? Sure, my name is Mary Smith. And your date of birth? My date of birth is August 16th, 1976. And your email address for me, please? My email address is mary.smith at gmail.com. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Absolutely. Right. So you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw. Is that correct? Well, I think that's just like the first thing that I typed, but it wasn't really what I, you know, I just typed it and then I clicked submit. So that was a, I mean, it's part of the problem, but I would say that more of a problem for me is that I can't quite move my left arm. I mean, I can move it, but it's numb. And then I also feel some like tingling in my fingertips. Okay. So numbness in the left arm. Yeah. How long has it been going on for? So I've started taking this boxing class. I've been taking boxing class for a few weeks. and I feel like maybe it's probably been I'd say for at least two weeks and it's kind of gotten worse like beginning I just kind of felt a little bit of tingling and then it's gotten it's gotten worse since then then the numbing kind of started I can feel it both in my you know a little bit in my elbow and then in my arm as well as in my hand and now because it hasn't gotten better I tried to get a massage it's not better or you know try to take warm baths it's not better so I figured I'd call you and and just figure out what's going on right so have you mentioned that massage in a warm bath any medications that you've taken so far well it's you know it's it's numb and I kind of looked stuff online but you know I do take ibuprofen just because my my muscles were sore a little bit and I've taken this boxing class so you know I kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand so that's been a little bit painful so I've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that okay but like I said I mean I tried massage I tried some hot baths and that didn't help with this numbness thing so I'm just kind of getting a little worried of course also from you've just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards? Is that the tingling numbness elbow below, not from your shoulder? Well it kind of funny Sometimes I will feel it in my shoulder Like if I try to if I try to like you know move like in boxing and stuff I will even like maybe feel a little bit of a little bit of pain But I would say if I'm just like resting, if I'm sitting like right now, I can feel like it's numb and I actually feel tingling right now. Not in all of my fingers, just in some. Yeah. So which fingers do you feel numb? Okay. So it's my second, third and fourth finger. uh-huh second third and fourth finger and is it your palm side or you know the back of your hand side which is numb or both no it's it's the it's this side so the front side it's the front side okay right and have you been dropping things at all like you know when you try to hold on to things like a glass or something have you been dropping it so not so much with the glass but I will say well I play a little bit of a piano and so I just noticed that it's it's been kind of harder to get the notes I can I can grasp I can grasp a glass but because I use my right hand most at a time you know I'm not left-handed so I it's kind of hard for me too so you would say there's a mild weakness mind yes so just to get my facts right so you it's definitely weakness rather than because of the pain you can't hold it there's two different things so you know sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you no no it's not hurting it's not hurting it's like numb I can't feel it right okay yeah fine so you have definitely having some sort some form of weakness okay any neck pain at all no not no neck pain okay right okay so just a bit more of a background because I don't watch information on the system do you have any past medical history that you'd like to share well I guess because of this you know I'm not sure if it's boxing I also had a really bad cold like a month ago I mean I was out you know drinking with friends one of our co-workers just had his three-year anniversary and we kind of went crazy and we were like out partying until you know late hours and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me and And then after that, I was sick for probably good like two weeks. I was at home. I think I must have had some kind of like a flu or something. So it's that. And then I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago is like I all of a sudden just couldn't see from my left eye. Like I lost some like a little bit of a field of vision. But that just lasted not very long. I mean, that just lasted maybe for, I don't know, 20, 20 minutes. and I kind of thought I don't know maybe it was the cold you know and the virus and all that so I guess that what I can you know that the last thing I can remember but in general I I pretty healthy I mean I you know I work out a lot and I I don really have any medical problems do you have any headaches at all from the in the recent past um sometimes I get headaches but I think they're just tired headaches you know sometimes I'll get kind of tired but I think that's probably because I work too much or you know because like I'll go for a workout and then I'll really just exhaust myself and then I just kind of feel this fatigue. Or sometimes, like this morning, for example, I just felt really fatigued and I couldn't even get myself to the gym. But, you know, since I have this numbness, it's kind of like hard to work out, right? Do you wear glasses at all? Glasses, contact lenses? No. No, so no glasses. Right. And you've not experienced anything like a seizure, a fit, anything like that? What's a seizure? Like when you lose consciousness and you start shaking. oh no no no no nothing like that no fits yeah okay and your weakness is only in your left arm leg walking and all this normal yeah yeah yeah walking is normal yeah you mentioned for a while you couldn't see you know the outside peripheral vision from your left eye how long did that episode last for you know i think it was only maybe like 20 minutes or so it's almost like it happened and i thought oh my god it's probably i'm still like sick from this you know virus thing cold and so i just kind of slapped it off and then when i uh um when i woke up it was gone sure okay um okay so is there any regular medications that you're using not really i just take ibuprofen every once in a while i take vitamin d um i take some i i like my g my gp really wants me to take iron supplements but you know there are this like huge pills so i i'm most of the time i just forget but vitamin d i take and then sometimes i take melatonin to help me sleep okay all right and any family history you'd like to share any significant family history i know that my dad has i don't know if it's hypo i think it's hypothyroidism yeah and then my like he's got some autoimmune stuff going on like that much i know and then my mom my mom she's she's actually not in a great shape she's got diabetes type 2 she's got hypertension um she's got gosh what is it oh yeah she's got high cholesterol um and i think that's it for her yeah right any neurological conditions in the family They are related conditions. No. Okay that fine Okay So after speaking and examining yourself on it i think it quite important that we do investigate it a bit further i just wondering whether there something a bit more than just the boxing here okay a few things that's made me think other than just like a boxing injury is for instance um you know when you said you can't your vision went the peripheral vision was not there for about 20. So and that with the weakness of the arms make me think is there something else going on rather than just measuring? What do you think may be going on? Sometimes you know you do get things like MS, multiple sclerosis, so people with multiple sclerosis can have visual problems like what you've experienced and sometimes you know the odd numbness tingling sensations going on okay oh my god will i be in wheelchair if we catch it a bit early there are treatments for it okay i'm not obviously i'm not suggesting that you do have it but it is quite important to find out that whether you have it or not that's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be dealt with here yeah so what we can do is I'm going to do an urgent, very urgent neurology referral. Yeah, what that might entail is the brain scan and things like that. Hello? I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm here, I'm here. I know this might sound a bit of a shock to you, but I think it is important that we investigate this a bit more seriously. All right, yeah, that makes sense. okay any questions at all well what's okay so you're gonna do the referral um should i be taking any drugs or no that's something we can't do the treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that when you have an acuity you know acute reaction or things like that but saying that first we need to adopt firm diagnosis yeah yes why you're waiting for this to be done if there's any weakness you know if the weakness progresses to your legs or there's any kind of headaches vomiting fits and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better then that would be an aene okay got it all right okay thank you doctor yeah i'm i'm sorry i i i do appreciate you are a bit worried but you know it's good that we know that you've come and spoken to us today and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling okay thank you doctor appreciate your time that's okay you take care bye bye bye now
