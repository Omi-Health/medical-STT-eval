Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me okay? I can hear you but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Is that okay? Am I meant to just have a connection on the screen? It's audio. No, no, it's absolutely fine. Okay. Now before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? So my name is Dan Chowdhury, I am 27. 27, okay. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan? So I've just been having some troubles, basically, I guess it's been a little while now and I've just been feeling not so great and it's all come from like it's like basically I think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out like loads of it like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and yeah it doesn't feel very solid it's so just it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's yeah it's just not not being very pleasant and like I I just, it just kind of hasn't, doesn't feel like it's getting better, so. Wow, no, sorry to hear that. I think that there's a lot going on there. Well, when did it all start, your symptoms? So I think it was a few, when I think about it, so Monday, Tuesday, I saw, I think it was about three, it's been about three days now. Okay, and is it mainly diarrhea? So you mentioned watery stools. How many times are you going a day, would you say? So I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Right, so you're losing a lot of fluid there. Yeah, so I mean I'm trying to drink a lot of water but yeah it's just quite a lot and it's, yeah I think I feel like it's just just fluids coming out. Okay, have you got any blood in your stool? Um, so, no I don't remember anything like, no I think it's just, nothing like that, there's nothing like that. And any tummy pain? Any pain in your tummy? Yeah, I mean I feel a cramp and then I know it's time to go right, so around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go, so yeah, I mean that's the kind of first sign. Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? It's kind of, if I think about it, it's like at the bottom. I don't know if that makes sense. Why don't we start with, is it in the middle or is it to one particular side? I think it feels pretty like in the middle to me, not on any side, left to right. And does this pain come and go or is it there constantly? um it comes and goes it comes again okay and if I was asking a scale of one to ten ten being the worst pain you ever had how bad is this pain okay so like so what do you mean by uh pain so i i think it maybe is this pain that making you double over is 10 is it 10 out of 10 the worst pain you've ever had or is it more of a kind of a mild pain like a 3 out of 10 i i guess so i'm when i think about it like when i get it i can pretend that i don't feel it so i can still sit down and i can still like cover it up and people don't really notice so I don't know what that means but maybe is that like a six or a seven? It's six actually. Okay all right good. Apart from the pain and diarrhea any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Yeah I definitely feel kind of nauseous and like I have vomited and when I like I think it's maybe something to do with like whenever I have like milk or something like that I just feel like I want to vomit and actually yeah one time I just like had some milk and I just completely vomited it yeah the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea is that right sorry could you repeat that the vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhea all right no it's not okay all any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? um so yeah I think I am pretty I feel kind of really hot all the time and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that but it's yeah I'm not like not a normal temperature okay so you're feeling hot okay in terms of your water works are you passing urine okay Yeah, but I guess less frequently maybe, but it seems to be okay. Okay, all right. Fine. You mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you, for example, gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else with diarrhea, for example? So my brother has actually had something like this for five days as well. And I can't think of what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally deals with this stuff a lot better than me. But yeah, that's why. Is your brother now better? So he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better but I'm not really sure. He said he's had something for a little while as well. Okay, alright. Are you having anything to eat or drink? I can see you're drinking your coffee but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? So it just feels like, the fluids do go down but it just feels like it's going straight through. It just feels like it's going straight through. okay all right fine when was the last time you had anything solid to eat which you kept in um so I had some I mean I had some lunch today but again it just it just came come out pretty loose all right and and Dan moving forwards are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical history um so I yeah I think I think otherwise I'm fit well I yeah I mean I'm an okay weight I can't think of any related medical history I mean like my yeah I don't know I don't think so well thank you don't take any regular medications then so I um no I mean I've been taking some like paracetamol and stuff like that lately but I haven't been I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that that okay and do you have any allergies any medications um so i don't have any allergies that i know of okay what about any family history do you have any family history of bowel problems um so with bowel like just is the colon like something yeah so what i mean about bowel is the whole gut really anything from the mouth so yeah my my dad actually has um colon cancer at the moment oh dear i'm very sorry to hear that how is he so um from what i heard he's kind of so i don't i don't speak to him that often so i don't i don't know the exact details and i i don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer and all that everything but um he's sort of in his third stage i'm not sure what that means exactly um yeah okay yeah so So yeah, I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affected him a lot. And I guess he's had it for a little while now. I'm really sorry to hear that. I'll make a note of that because it's important to know these kind of details. And socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan? So not my brother. He doesn't live with me. I live with my sister and my mum. Okay. And how are things at home? I think, in what sense do you mean that? In general, day-to-day life, are you managing okay? Any particular challenges? I mean, I think, yeah, it's been tricky going to work with all of this. I dislike taking time off work I feel like I just want to go when I can so I try and go I think at home yeah I just haven't really I don't normally actually eat with my family I normally buying stuff and that kind of thing so I don't think it's affected them and I haven't really been I'm really gone into detail with my sister and my mum about it. Yeah, I'd just rather deal with these things. Cool. You mentioned work, what is it you do for work? So I work at an office in central London so I work in government Government, okay. Right. Just a couple of last final questions. Smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? So I smoke, I smoke for like socially but not like regularly so normally if it's a Friday or something like that I might have a cigarette or something like that. Alcohol? Sorry? And alcohol? So alcohol, you know I might have a beer during the weekdays, not that many maybe. On Fridays I have more alcohol, but yeah, I buy a lot more units. I suppose not every week but maybe once or twice a month that yeah, I'll go out with friends and drink a lot so that that's yeah that's very helpful to know so Dan just as a conclusion um just to wrap it all up I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis okay a bit of a basic infection of your tummy okay there's nothing to worry about I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days just like I did for your brother make sure you drink plenty of fluids okay and you can just drink like normal water I just feel like every time I well it's just coming out but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins and so you can get things like dirolyte which is a fluid replacement we can get from the pharmacy it's probably worth recommending that like a prescription for that no you can just get over the counter okay and you can try just in a regular paracetamol if you are being feverish but if your symptoms aren't setting down in the next couple of days so 48 hours I want you to give me a call back because you know if you are getting dehydrated and we need to do further investigations okay but I think this let's see how you are the next one to two days okay and we'll catch up soon okay okay so you're saying that I should i could uh i'll try and buy this diary like what what should i do in terms of um food and that kind of thing should i just focus fluids food is all yeah absolutely it's a clear fluid you can use soft diet things like soup mash and then gradually build up um as much as your body can tolerate um but really let's try and keep us all well hydrated first okay okay is it okay for me to carry on having like um paracetamol and things like that absolutely if you are having if you've bit of tummy pain if you're feeling feverish then i think paracetamol is very sensible okay okay try and avoid alcohol if you can uh okay i'll try yeah okay all right then okay thank you for your help all right thank you very much thanks thanks for helping me out
