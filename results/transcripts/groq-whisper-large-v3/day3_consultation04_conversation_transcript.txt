That's correct and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Thank you. Okay so you've mentioned in our notes that you've got some tightness, if you could tell me a bit more about it please. Yeah so about two to three days ago I was running with a friend and usually I could talk to her whilst I ran but I found myself actually short of breath. I'm not really sure of breath when I'm walking but definitely if I'm walking briskly now and I've used my blue inhaler but to no avail it hasn't really helped me yeah so I'm having I'm just wheezing a bit and coughing and just generally a bit short breath wheezing and coughing okay and you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler so how often are you using the blue inhaler I think I'm just using that as and when I have symptoms yeah so at the moment you are having shortness of bread so are you using it every day at the moment? Yeah and morning and evening to kind of prevent it as well. Okay and which color what's the name of your preventer? It's a blue I think in totality my history of salbutamol, clenyl, cetroben and hydrocortisone that I taking as well Okay so could you repeat that your salbutamol clenil cetroben and hydrocortisone And hydrocortisone so you have eczema also yeah What's that sorry? You do have a history of eczema. My brother's asthmatic and my sister had eczema and I've got a few issues that I think could be eczema as well. Okay right so coming back to your shortness of breath you've mentioned you're wheezy and you're coughing are you bringing up any phlegm at all? No I don't I'm not coughing up much sputum. Okay no sputum okay right Teo and how are you using your your Clenil so are you using it every day I think I'm using that every day and this sound beautiful just like as and when so how are you using the Clenil is it twice a day yes okay and have you ever been admitted in hospital because your was so bad no I haven't okay Right, when was the last time you had an asthma attack? About three to four years ago. Three to four years ago. And what did the GP do at that time? Just encouraged me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative. Okay, so you didn't have any steroids or antibiotics? Not that I can remember. Okay Okay Have you ever had oral steroids in the past No When was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse About two years ago Okay, two years ago. Okay, but your asthma was pretty under control till now, isn't it? Yes, just in the last two times. So do you do a peak flow meter at home? Peak flow reading where you blow into, you know, do you do that? Just every now and then, I haven't done it over the last, since I've had symptoms. Okay, so what was your peak flow reading when you're good? Like normal peak flow reading? I think 130. okay let's say it's about 380 yeah yeah yeah okay right so that's your normal yeah right here okay so what we need okay do you have any allergies at all um i have a fever sorry could you repeat that please sorry i have hay fever okay okay no no any med allergies to medication oh no okay so you're not allergic to anything okay so no allergies okay excellent right here so what we need to do that obviously we you haven't had an asthma check for some time and it looks like you can be having a small small exacerbation so what i would like you to be seen by one of our GPs in the next few days In the interim what I like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when okay and use it maximum about every two to four four hours but if you using it that often that means pretty much that you know your asthma is really bad you can use it but that's not ideal the blue uh the brown in your clenil the brown inhaler you can up the dose if you're using just two puffs twice a day you can increase it to four puffs twice a day yeah and while this is to do while you're waiting to see us now okay mentioned you know you're doing what you know increase the canal to four puffs twice a day and you're using the asthma you know the blue inhalers every two to four hours and your breathing is getting really worse then you would need to take yourself to a e you shouldn't wait for our appointment okay so when the doctor sees you what we're going to do is we're going to examine your chest yeah make you do the pizza reading so depending on what we find you might need some antibiotics or some steroids but anyway while you're at home we are going to by increasing your clenal we are increasing your steroid intake anyway okay so So yeah, so any questions you wanted to ask me? I know that's a good thing. Yeah, so call support, book an appointment, you see, and I will recommend that you do the face-to-face. In the interim, increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly. But if your breathing's getting worse and you've not seen enough, do take your cough to A&E. All right? Great. okay thank you so much for your time you're welcome take care then bye
