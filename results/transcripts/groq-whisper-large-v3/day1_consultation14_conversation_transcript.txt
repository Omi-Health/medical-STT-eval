Hello? Hello. Hi there. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your date of birth? Yeah, my name is April and I'm 50. You're 50, okay. April, how can I help you this afternoon? Well, I've just been having this like cough for quite a few days and my nose is running. It's just been super annoying and it's not going away. Okay, when did it all start? I think it started like maybe a bit less than a week ago like maybe maybe five or six days ago okay and you mentioned a couple of things there you mentioned a cough you mentioned a bit of a runny nose all right yeah okay let's focus on your cough first can you tell me a bit more about your cough it's just so continuous it's really really frustrating it's quite dry and it's just all day like keeps me up at night as well which is really annoying okay so it's a dry cough so you don't bring up any you don't bring up any oh i can hear that yeah and you don't bring up any uh mucky phlegm or anything like that no okay so keep you up at night um you mentioned uh the cold symptoms as well the runny nose do you have a sore throat at all i mean apart from i mean the coughing is giving me a sore throat but it's not like you know not more than than that you know just just my throat is irritated from coughing but it's not like it's not that bad when i swallow or anything right do you have any uh do you how are your ears your ears feel blocked or no they feel okay actually yeah no pain or discharge is nothing nothing on the ears okay all right um fine in terms of your breathing um how is your breathe how's your chest is your breathing more labored? I don't think so, like I guess like it's labored when I'm coughing and I can't breathe but like not yeah I don't think so. When you walk around you don't feel breathless do you? I don't feel breathless no I feel you know generally tired okay yeah but not not anything special with my chest. Any pain in your chest? No, not that either. Okay. You mentioned feeling tired. Have you felt feverish at all? Have you had a temperature? I been having like shivers even when I in bed You know like when you go to sleep and you feel like I should be warm but I still still you know shivering a little bit my temperature so I not 100 sure if I had a fever but feels like I probably did because I was just I was next to my boyfriend and he was completely warm and totally fine and I just like shivering more sweaters on and I was still cold. I do, okay, okay, alright. Um, fine. And in terms of any other symptoms, have you had any nausea, have you had any vomiting? No, no, no nausea, no vomiting, like, um, yeah, nothing like that. How's your appetite? Um, I mean, it's okay. I, at the beginning, like when I was starting to have the symptom, the coughing and stuff, I had a little bit of diarrhea but it didn't cut my appetite or anything. I just like, my stomach wasn't feeling great. Okay has it got better now the diarrhea? Yeah yeah it got better it was only like the first like it started at the same time as the cough started and then it stopped so I thought everything would be fine but then the cough just stopped going. Okay fine. Any problems with your waterworks at all? with my what are you your water works your urine oh no no no that's fine passing urine okay you're drinking plenty of fluids and passing urine okay yeah I drank loads of water when I started having the diarrhea now that it stopped I just went back to normal okay all right in terms of any other things you notice any any funny skin rashes or problems with your muscles or joints like my you You know when I was telling you I had chills and I was really cold, my muscle was really hurting. I'm trying to do Pilates but it's hurting me so much at the moment. Right. To be honest, all I feel like doing is just lying in bed. Right, okay. Sorry that must be very difficult for you. Yeah, especially in my arms, my legs, just everywhere basically. You've been quite nostalgic and weak, you mentioned. Yeah, pretty much. Okay, April are you normally otherwise fit and well? Am I normally what? Fit and well. So do you have any other medical history? Well I have type 2 diabetes and I have quite high blood pressure Okay and what do you take for your blood pressure What medications do you take on a regular basis I take metformin for the diabetes and I take lisinopril for the high blood pressure Okay fine. Any allergies at all to medication? No allergies. No okay. Regarding any family history is anything I should be aware of? My dad also has type 2 diabetes but I think that's it. Okay, all right. Who's looking after your diabetes? Is there anyone, do you have a doctor in hospital? I just regularly go see a doctor and just checks up on it. Same with the high blood pressure, like I have it under control and since I've started taking this medication I've just been like regularly checking that it's under control. Great, excellent. In terms of your social situation, who lives at home with you? It's just me and my partner. Okay, fine. Is your partner well at the moment? Yeah he has none of this like he's just going ahead like like nothing like I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him but not diarrhea nothing he's fine. He's got away with it at the moment okay and are you working at the moment April? Yeah I am working but the first day I skipped because because I was feeling just too shit yeah but then I just felt like hard to go about because I had so much to do. I've been going in but it's not been fun. No I can imagine. What is it that you do for work? I am a developer. So you work in the IT field? Yeah, I work in IT. Not too active a job? No. Have you been quite stressful recently? Not more than usual. I don't think it's related to stress. I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work currently. I'm unable to take a day off to try and recover. So yeah, I don't think I've made it. So the reason I ask is sometimes stress can really affect your immune system. But it's good to know you're not feeling stressed. Do you smoke at all, April? I used to, but I've stopped for about six months now. Okay. And what about alcohol? I mean yeah I don't think I drink that much I I don't really know how you count the units I guess like I don drink more than like like let say three evenings a week and I really get like properly drunk or anything And what is it that you drink Wine mostly And how much do you drink on those nights I'd say like maybe two or three glasses. Okay so yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of the recommended limit. Something you think about just because of your blood pressure and diabetes maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can yeah how much do you think i should cut down on it really ideally the right answer is to cut down completely but so in practice i know that's not realistic so maybe for the first few weeks one you cut down to two glasses a week and then one week thereafter um and if you are coping okay then we can maybe try and cut down all together okay okay just something for you to think about um right so uh just as we wrap up really um april i think based on your story i think essentially i think you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness um i don't think there's anything to worry about you know you've had a bit of a cough bit of a runny nose feeling quite weak and lethargic i'm hoping that you know you're probably over the worst of it now it's been five days i'm hoping you're maybe going to get better the next couple of days normally last about a week to 10 days what what should i do if it just keeps going on and on like if it's still going on in say four days yeah absolutely so you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to you know get some nice good rest drink plenty of fluids keep yourself well hydrated you can take regular paracetamol if you feel like it's still not getting any better in two to three days it's probably worth coming back to see me again we can check you over and if you are still feeling feverish and your cough isn't getting any better then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest which can sometimes be a common source of infection um you think i should keep going to work or do you think i should just yeah so i think really i think it depends on you it's um if you are coughing then there is a theatrical you know risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still so I would say maybe take a day or two off work if you can and get some good bed rest and maybe think about work early next week. Okay, okay. But if your cough isn't getting any better or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner, okay? Okay, but otherwise I don't need to worry. No, no, nothing to worry about otherwise. Okay, all right. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bye.
