Hello? Hello, can you hear me well? Yes, I think it's a bit better. It's a bit, it's a bit, it's not very clear, but let's continue anyway. Okay. Okay, let's start again. So how can I help you, sir? Yes, so it's been a few days now. I have like a sore and a red skin. It's kind of, it's really itchy and it's like super annoying. So I'd like to find something quick to solve it. No, no problem. I'm happy to help. Whereabouts in your skin is it affected? Mostly like my chest, my hands, my arms. Like really it's super annoying. Like it's itching a lot like all the time and I can't even sleep at night. Like I really need something quickly to solve it because even at work, like when I'm in the meeting and I have to like think about my work and focus, like actually focus on my work, it's really annoying because I can't actually think But what I have to say, I'm always disturbed by this disease. No, no, okay. I understand this is obviously affecting you and we'll try our very best to get it sorted out for you. Have you had anything like this before in the past? So, yes. Earlier I was prescribed for my eczema. Okay. And they gave me some cream and something to... When I was in the shower I had to put something. Okay. Did it help? I mean at that time yes but the symptoms, like these symptoms, when the symptoms appeared again I tried those and it didn't work. I've tried a few things like I bought like a steroid cream at the pharmacy last night but it apparently didn't help because it's still itching a lot today. Okay. Yeah. Do you remember the name of the cream you bought? Steroid cream. Okay, steroid, okay. would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different it's much more like itchy and my exam I was more like only in the arms and now it's also on the chest and in there and the other hands as well okay yeah when like I like for instance hiking during the weekends and I am I can redo it anymore because it like very like like I wanted to that last weekend and it was super painful and I have to take like showers every day to be able to kind of ease this itching part which is very very annoying no well okay that's okay so you mentioned the itchiness and you also mentioned it's been quite sore have you noticed any bleeding or discharge from your skins no so my skin is a bit cracked in some parts like kind of cracked if you see what I mean okay but yeah you know I'm not yeah any other pus or blood coming out of your skin and you mentioned it all started three days ago are you aware of any triggers so anything that you may have done that may caused your symptoms to start so for example have you changed your shower gel any clothing have you been around anyone no it's actually like it's really annoying because I'm thinking about maybe I should change something because I haven't and I don't understand that I'm kind of afraid of asking people around me because it's kind of you know I don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions it's kind of intimate and so I don't want to hurt you now. No, no, okay that's okay. Fine, so just to re-summarize, for the last four days you've had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, mainly your chest and did you mention your arms and legs as well? No, just the chest, hands and like inside the elbows. Okay, anything on your face at all? In my what? On your face. My face? No. No, okay. And apart from this, any other symptoms have you noticed? For example, have you noticed any temperature or fevers? No, just the itching. Itching? Nothing else. Okay, so your bowels are working okay? Your chest is okay? No cough, no breathing difficulties? No. You're passing urine okay? I think so. Okay, all right. It's always good to know. I mean do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms Any what Any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms So I had eczema before so maybe it this but it seems like more like my eczema was only on the arm so I not sure I really have no idea. Okay that's okay so normally at this stage I like to examine you to see the rash yourself and see exactly what type of rash it is but from what you've told me you mentioned it's you've got some dry skin and some cracked skin as well and it's been very itchy and so with your your background of eczema so it says a couple of questions I want to ask you which I completely forgot my apologies and apart from the eczema do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of no I just had asthma in the past but okay not anymore okay and do you take any regular medications at the moment? No. Okay, do you have any allergies to anything? Hello? Hello, yes. Oh, can you hear me? Sorry, I think it cracked. Do you have any allergies at all? Oh allergies, no. No, okay. And tell me about your situation at home. Who do you live with? So I live with a few flatmates. So you know I'm 31. I have a full-time job and so I'm living with a few people to save money. Okay and what do you do for work? I work at a pharmaceutical company so it's been a few years now. It's kind of interesting, we're working on a kind of project manager. Do you want to know more about it? Okay, no, no, no, that's absolutely fine. Just a couple of questions I want to ask you which can sometimes affect your symptoms is do you smoke at all? No. No, and do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No. You know, once in a while I can, I like hanging out with people once in a while. So yeah I say a few beers per week something like this Nothing crazy I used to drink a lot more when when i was younger but it been okay okay okay i got to say at this stage i got to say the sound quality is not uh great but i will continue because we've come this far um so based on everything you mentioned sir i do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema um the reason being that you said it's quite itchy um it's many affecting your chest and your back and having looked at your skin the rash does pick quite familiar you mentioned you using steroid creams yesterday from the pharmacy I wonder whether giving you stronger prescription of a steroid may be beneficial which I'm happy to prescribe to you today as well as I'm gonna give you something some emollients which helps to moisturize the skin we use in the bath and shower and it's definitely worth using that for the first seven to ten days before we make a decision on whether it's working or not it's also worth using antihistamines which you can sometimes buy over the counter things like loratadine or piratin which can help the itchiness of your skin and it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap because if that's causing your symptoms and we need to have a discussion about it next time I see you okay just I tried antihistamines lately but it didn't really help oh could you say again sorry I have tried the antihistamines okay but it didn't okay so something for you to think about you can get different type of antihistamines I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well something like fixer fennel Dean which I can give to you today it's definitely worth trying it's not going to you any harm but I say anything using the steroids and the emollients on a regular basis over the next week to 10 days should hopefully control your symptoms but do come back and see me next week if things don't get better that sounds good okay do you have any questions for me no that's it okay well I wish you all the best thank you very much have a good day
