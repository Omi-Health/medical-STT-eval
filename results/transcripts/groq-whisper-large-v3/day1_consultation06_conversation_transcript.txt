Hello? Hello there. Hello, can you hear me OK? Yes, I can hear you. OK, great. Are you a doctor? I am, yes. Dr. Seed here, Oscar. How can I help you this afternoon? I'm contacting you because I've been quite short of breath lately. OK. Do you want to tell me a bit more about it? When did it all start? Yes. Well it seems to have been slowly getting worse over the last couple of weeks. It's become quite troublesome in the last few days. Normally I can walk to the shops without a problem but now I'm having to sort of sit down and catch my breath and I'm even starting to get a bit breathless just about the house and it's got me kind of worried. I don't really know what's going on. Okay, is there anything you're particularly worried about? Well I've got heart failure. I was told that a while ago and I got a bit breathless when I was first diagnosed and put on some medicine that helped but I'm a bit worried it's getting worse. Right okay so you mentioned you've been feeling short of breath for the last couple of weeks but mainly the last couple of days has got a bit worse and you're now feeling more breathless or kind of minimal exertion you mentioned. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all with your breath? So for example, any pain in your chest? No pain in my chest. Okay. Have you found yourself coughing at all? I've got a bit of a dry cough, but it's not too troublesome. Okay. Okay. And how's your general health otherwise are you feeling weak, lethargic? I'm feeling a little run down but otherwise pretty normal. I've noticed my ankles have got bigger. Okay what do you mean by that? It's just like they've sort of swollen up a bit. Okay is that both ankles? ankles? Yeah both ankles yeah it's a bit embarrassing. I can imagine yeah and again over how long has this have you noticed this for? I kind of noticed it the last few days. Last few days okay and is this something that you've had before in the past I think my ankles did swell up a bit last time the heart failure was a problem Okay okay Fine okay So just to really recap so really the last couple of weeks you been feeling breathless but worse in the last couple of days You mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough and some swelling in your ankles, but importantly no chest pain. And have you noticed your heartbeat racing at all, so palpitations or skipped heartbeat? No not really. Okay and any temperatures or fevers? No. Okay and how about your appetite? Are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah that's fine. Okay and your water works? Are you passing urine okay? Yeah I usually pee a lot. Yeah. Sure okay all right. So moving on to your past medical history, you You mentioned heart failure. Any other medical history I should be aware of? Well, I was told I had like a, they called it like a small heart attack about five years ago. I had like chest pain and they took me to hospital. Okay. And they, but then I just got better. Okay. When you say small heart attack, did they give you a name for what happened? A name of a diagnosis? uh i can't remember they just called it as something like that a small heart attack okay was it like angina or um i know they they said they it seemed it was like more than angina okay um uh but um i didn't but i only had to stay in hospital for a few days okay uh and yeah I've been okay since then. You've been okay since then, okay all right. So apart from the the heart problems, the heart failure, any other problems I should be aware of? No I think I'm otherwise I'm okay. Okay, do you take any regular medications apart from your diuretics that you're taking? Do you know which ones? Yeah I take something called furosemide. Rosamund, do you know which dose you're taking? I can't remember, I'm sorry doctor, I have to check. No problems, any other medications? Yeah, I take aspirin and Bidoprolol. Is that Metoprolol was it? Bidoprolol. Sorry the connection is not very good okay thank you yep um uh simbastan okay all right any allergies at all any medications no no allergies okay anything in the family that that that uh that important for me to know any family history of medical problems heart problems lung problems uh my My father died of a heart attack. I'm sorry to hear that. How old was your father when he passed away? He was early 60s. Early 60s, okay. Anything else I should be aware of? My mother had osteoporosis. Okay. Is your mother still with us? Yes, she's still living. Okay, all right. and socially sir just tell me a bit more about your situation at home who lives at home with you I live on my own and I got two cats you got two cats okay great did you have names they're my family they're called they're called Holly and Tim okay so this is you and your cats and in terms of day to day are you working at the moment? I work part-time as a lorry driver. Okay and how is that? Is that quite stressful? Long hours? It's okay. Yeah like when I'm working it's pretty exhausting. I guess I'm a bit worried that if I get sick I won't, if I get more sick then I won't be able to work properly. Yeah this certainly a consideration isn't there so let's let's try and get you better soon so it doesn't have any um impact on your on your job and do you find yourself doing a lot of antisocial hours do you do a lot of night driving weekend driving oh no i i only take shifts during the day i don't like working at night okay all right and what about smoking and alcohol so because it can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems do you smoke at all not anymore So you used to smoke? Yeah. How many did you smoke a day on average? Oh it was about a pack a day back in the day. And how many years was that for? Oh that was good 25 years Okay well done for stopping it must have been very difficult for you Well done for stopping And what about alcohol I don drink alcohol Do you do much in the way of exercise I try and walk to the shops at least once a day but that's about it. I don't get running like I used to when I was young. Right, and certainly now with your symptoms you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the shop she said um right so um based on your based on your history and having listened to your story i wonder whether you've had a flare-up of your heart failure sir um which can sometimes happen um um and you know it's what's going on so it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be um and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure there's obviously um it's first thing that comes to my mind. Now there's a couple of options to move forward. Given that you're otherwise well at the moment and having examined you, your chest and your saturations and blood pressure all okay, I'm quite happy to increase your dose of frusomide. Maybe rather than one tablet a day, we can give you two tablets a day for the first few days and see how you're getting on. Okay, if you think that would be best. I think it's definitely worth treating your symptoms but what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests like a blood test and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart to see how well your heart's pumping okay is that something you've had yeah so an echo scan it's a jelly scan of your heart you may have had this done before when you're diagnosed and it's just to get a good oh yes sorry uh yeah i remember now okay fine that's something i can organize for you today and they may take a week or two weeks for that to be organized but i think certainly in the meantime let's um let's let's get a blood test done we can check your um you know your full blood can look for signs of anemia we can have a check your kidney function um and we can definitely increase your um your frusomide uh to you know one tablet twice a day but i really like we're like you'd come back and see him in about a week's time to see how you're getting on does that sound reasonable i think that sounds like a good plan And of course in the meantime if you are getting more unwell, so if you're getting more breathless or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations or dizziness, then you know, send a, I want you to give me a call sooner than that and we can have a chat on the phone as well. Okay, I'll see how I get on. Okay, do you have any questions for me? I think that's all pretty clear, thank you very much doctor. Great, no, I wish you all the best, have a good day. See you soon. Okay, thank you.
