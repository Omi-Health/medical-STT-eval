My name is Lizzie Irvine. 23rd July 1995. Great, thank you Lizzy. And are you in a confidential and comfortable space to talk? Yeah, especially on a Friday. Comfortable. Great. How can I help? Yeah, just for the last couple of days I've been feeling really sick in my lower tummy and I've had a bit of a temperature, so feeling quite like hot and sweaty. And it's, yeah, Yeah, I'm getting really uncomfortable. Okay, so you've been feeling nauseous and you've had some pain in your lower tummy or you say you've been feeling sick in your lower tummy? Yeah, it's more of an ache. So like an ache in my lower tummy. Okay. And then I think it's feeling hot and sweaty. Sometimes I think it's sickness, but yeah, a bit of an ache. Okay, so feeling hot, sweaty, unwell for three days, feeling sick nausea with an ache in your tummy any actual vomiting so yeah no just nauseous no vomiting yet luckily and it's only been for a couple of days but yeah okay and any problems with your waterworks or diarrhea no so I'm I'm going to the loo a little bit more often than usual I drink lots of water but it does feel like more often. Yeah, like nothing too out of the ordinary. And I was a little bit like, I don't know, constipated I guess. About a week ago, but I'm okay now. Okay, so you've been constipated a week ago. things you're having regular bowel motions now he said you had a bit of diarrhea a bit of watery no it was more like I was just a little bit bummed up and then about a week ago that kind of cleared and I'm a normal now okay and you're saying you're going you're drinking lots of water you're going to toilet more frequently for a wee yes yeah I'd say so I tend to drink a lot of water anyway but I feel like I'm going to the toilet more. Any pain when you pass urine? No, no pain. No stinging? No just seems normal yeah Okay and sort of no foul smelling urine or anything like that um no nothing nothing i can think of no you having saying you going a bit more frequently are you having to go with urgency to the toilet are we no there's no urgency um Yeah, no pain or urgency, just yeah, being quite frequently, but it's all seeming normal. Yeah, I probably wouldn't have thought of it being linked, but yeah. Okay. All right, so the main symptom is feeling sick with this, you've been feeling bunged up and this sort of pain in your tummy. Just to ask a few more questions about the pain tummy is it how would you describe the pain? It's yeah it's like below my belly button it's it's aching it does make me feel nauseous yeah so it's kind of more like I guess like in a dull ache just below the belly button kind of yeah here and it's it is it constant or is it coming and going it's yet feeling pretty constant over the last couple of days and just need to ask a few questions about your periods any chance you could pregnant at the moment? I don't know, probably not, I don't think so. Sexually active at the moment? Yes, yeah. You mentioned periods, I did notice a bit of, I don't know, it's like not necessarily like spotting but like in my my pee is like a little, I suppose I think I thought it was my period it's like a little bit pink in your pee did you say your so your pee is slightly red or slightly pink yeah but I am kind of like do you on my I didn't know if that was like yeah part of it okay so when was your your last menstrual period? Around a month ago, yeah, three and a bit weeks ago. OK. And did you say you're sexually active? Are you using contraception? I've got the implants. And? One sexual partner a regular boyfriend Yeah Just to go back to your symptom of constipation, can I just clarify when was the last time you had a bowel motion? Yesterday. Okay and do you feel like you are still quite bunged up at the moment? No it seems to have cleared up so I was about a week ago but I'm okay now the last few days yeah it's been okay. Okay all right so you just to sort of confirm your symptoms, you're feeling sort of sick, nauseous, with tummy pain which is fairly constant. Did the tummy pain come on suddenly or gradually? It's only been for the last two days, so I guess yeah quite recently. So it's come on gradually is it? Yeah. Not sudden onset. Okay and your last menstrual period was just three and a bit weeks ago um and but you say you've had some a little bit of spotting possibly before um in between periods or recently yeah the last kind of week or so yeah the last couple of days really but because i was due on yeah i think yeah just the last couple of days okay but you're expecting your period soon yes yeah sure um okay and just to ask a few questions are you uh do you have any other medical uh problems um i need to be aware of i'm allergic to amoxicillin allergic to amoxicillin um but no other medical problems no not that i'm aware of any drug allergies oh you mentioned the most cylinder anything else no that's it and do you take any medications at the moment um no no medications by money implants I think it's called um in plan on put on yeah sure thing okay do you smoke no and do you live with alone with your partner with my boyfriend and any other medical sorry any these is running you're running your family not only this bring to mind in my immediate family my brother is a type 1 diabetic Sure. Okay great so is there anything that you particularly concerned about with this nausea and the constipation? I don't know. It's just a really horrible ache, an obnoxious, hot, sweaty feeling. I'm not really sure why it's happening. um yeah the last couple of days that's probably all that's yeah it's getting comfortable yeah anything that you'd hoped particularly to get out of having this consultation anything i'm sorry was there anything that you'd hoped to get out having this specific consultation other than a diagnosis and getting better and you know being on the right track to feeling better yeah I know that's kind of I just want to get back to normal yes yeah sure okay so and then finally I didn't ask you do you have any discharge or anything like that from down below no no no discharge no discharge okay all right so I I think this could be a few different things it could just be constipation you mentioned that you were bunged up but you did go yesterday so it's and your bowel habits that you've been going regularly but you did mention that you were bunged up but there could be a few other things going on I would quite like to see you to do some further to do an examination and to do some some tests as well we need to definitely rule out pregnancy with you and possibly do some other examinations or also further tests so would you be happy to actually see a GP face to face soon today yes yeah yeah are you and you're feeling hot hot and sweaty have you been feeling lightheaded at all like you're going to faint? No, no, not like I'm going to faint. Okay, all right, well we're just sort of tying up, running out of time a little bit, but I'd really like to see you for some more examination and investigations. If in the meantime, between now and me or a GP seeing you, you feel worse in any way, you get lightheaded, you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you, then I think take them quite seriously and see somebody more urgently if possible. OK, was there anything else that you want to talk about right now? I'm glad we've got the ball rolling with this, and we can sort of see you again to take this a little bit further. OK? Yeah, thank you. Really appreciate that. OK. All right, thanks for your time. Cool. OK. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Bye.
