Hi there, it's Dr Smith from Babylon. Can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address please? I can't hear you at the moment actually, could you turn up the volume? That's better, thank you. Okay sorry about that. Are you in a private place you can have a consultation? Yes. What can I do for you today? I've been having this blinding headache for a few days and it's like really bothering me and I find it very hard to focus or like I can't even go to work. Okay and any headaches in the past before this? Not really just the on and off. I recently had one for like two days but it just went away with aproprofen so nothing like for longer than two days. So how did this start? It just started all of a sudden. I woke up one morning with a headache and that was three days ago and I just keep having it. It doesn't really go away with aproprofen either. I try that but it just it gets a little bit better but like doesn't go away. Okay and whereabouts in your head is the pain? It's kind of all over but I feel like over my right eye is a bit stronger. Okay any problems with your vision or any problems tolerating the light? Lights definitely make me more sensitive like I don't really like strong lights and yeah vision I think I I get this shooting light sometimes. I'm not sure how to explain it, just a bit of a weird kind of vision. Okay, and any nausea or vomiting? No, I'm feeling a bit sick but no vomiting. Any tingling or numbness or weakness anywhere? No. Any change in your smell or taste? No not at all And in the past when you had headaches what have they been like I would say quite normal headaches just a bit of a pressure in between my eyes but nothing major. Okay and with this has it been there all the time or is it coming and going? Kind of all the time so when I take apropen it gets a bit better so it's a bit like less it bothers me less but then I still have it, it's still there. And what would you say the severity is? If 10 is the worst pain you've ever had and zero is nothing, what would you say the pain is like? I guess it's mostly 8 and then it comes down to maybe a 5. Okay and what about at night time, are you able to fall asleep? Yeah, I'm sleeping well. Is it waking you up in the night time? No, no, no. But I can wake up with it in the morning. Okay. Any worse when you change position or bend over or cough or anything like that? Sometimes when I stand up quickly, I get a bit of a stabbing pain. Or if I tear in my head, I kind of feel like something is moving inside. Okay. And have you had any eye checks recently? Yeah, I actually had one recently and nothing changed my vision. Okay, and have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears or pain over the sinuses? No. Or phlegm? No. Any nosebleeds or coughing up any blood or anything? No. And just recently, have you been well or have you had any general problems, any changing your weight or tiredness lack of energy anything like that? No change of weight maybe lack of energy but it might be because I'm just having headaches so I find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities but you know when you have constant headaches. Have you been at work recently? I work from home but couldn't really manage to do it all the time so sometimes I just do the day off. So you've had a headache for three days, how many days have you missed off work? So I work from home all these three days First day I work from home and then the second day I just took the whole day off and today I just tried to work from home the first half of the day but I just stopped in the morning because I couldn focus Okay and any other medical problems in the past? I think I only had a bit of pain when I was younger but no cause was found and I went away but that's the only thing I know of. Okay, have you been abroad recently at all? No. Do you take any medications? Just the pill. Which one? Marcellone. And when did you start that? About a year ago. Any side effects with that? No, I don't think so. Have you noticed any increased frequency of headaches since you started that? No, because this headache is just very recent, so nothing really changes. Okay, and when you described your headaches in the past, you said they were just general, did you have any visual symptoms, flashlights? No. No. No. Was there nausea, vomiting with them? No, nothing. None of them. And you had your blood pressure checked recently with your pill? Yeah, I had a choice in the pharmacy when I got the pill and they said it was normal. And when was that? A year ago. Okay. And any allergies to anything? No. And who do you live with at home? Sorry? Who do you live with at home? Just by myself. Okay. And do you smoke? No. Do you drink any alcohol regularly? Yeah. How much in a normal week do you think? Probably like three beers once a week. Okay. And do you take any other drugs at all? No, apart from the apoprofen I take sometimes and the headache gets really bad. So, I mean, it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache and you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well. Yeah. But you haven't had a high temperature? Have you checked your temperature? No I didn I don really feel very sure anything Okay I mean it could possibly be a migraine type headache but in fact it still ongoing for three days We probably should book you into an appointment to get an examination Obviously if it settles in the meantime then we can cancel that but we should do a neurological examination, look at the back of your eyes as well. Okay. In terms of medication, I can prescribe you something similar to ibuprofen, but a bit stronger, which you can take instead of ibuprofen. And you can take paracetamol at the same time. Okay. So if you're happy to book an appointment with the support line for us to do a full examination and start the medication, which I prescribed you, take it with food. You said that when you go to bed, your headache's okay. and not waking you up in the night time? Yeah, it's not. But you mentioned migraine and that reminded me that my mum suffers from, like she has migraines. Okay, any other family history of medical problems? No, I think that's it, but I know that my mum, like she has quite bad migraines, she has the vomiting and everything. Okay, that's fine. I mean if in the meantime before your appointment your headache is getting unbearable getting worse or changing then um if it's that bad then you should go to a e and have an examination and you can call us for further advice on that okay and when when you have an examination with us we'll check your blood pressure as well just to make sure your pill is still appropriate for you because sometimes if we do think it's a migraine then you would have to change your pill if you've had these flashing lights and things like that is there anything in the pill that can cause it or is it well it's something so that pill if you were having my regular migraines with um flashing lights or other symptoms it wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill particularly we'd have to change it something else all right but you can carry on with that for the moment okay have you got any other questions um so would you like um send me a referral to a specialist or uh or to yeah if you book an appointment with the support team then we can do a full examination then okay perfect all right then take care thank you very much bye
