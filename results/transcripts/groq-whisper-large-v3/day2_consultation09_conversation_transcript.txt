So before we start your appointment, could I please confirm your full name and date of birth? Yes, my name is Jack Armani. That's a great thing. And my date of birth is 12 August 1958. that's great thank you for that um are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment yes I am okay so how can I help you today I am so I woke up this morning and hello yeah I'm still here yeah I'm a bit worried because I woke up this morning morning about an hour ago and I couldn't move my left arm anymore. Okay and how's your arm right now? Well like I feel no pain but just can't move it. So you still can't move and what time did you wake up? You said it was an hour, are you sure about that? Yes. Okay now can I just double check has this ever happened before? No, no it's really the first time. Okay and did you sleep anything in an awkward position or in a different bed or anything like that last night No everything as usual Okay and is there any discolouration in your hand No Does your hand feel cold? Not really. The arm feels fine, apart from me not being able to move it. Okay. And on your left side, have you had any symptoms in your left leg at all? No. but I feel a bit of tingling on the left side of my face right okay and how long has that tingling been there for? since I woke up since I started to feel the thing that since the the arm really stopped moving so an hour ago okay now I can't see you it's a telephone appointment but have you noticed any kind of um asymmetry in your face or did your face expression look different on one side compared to the other or anything different at all um not not really just having like a bit of issues like i was trying to drink earlier and i dribbled a bit and and tingling on on the left side okay so um you have some difficulties swallowing is that right um yeah any problems with your speech is your is your speech different to how it sounds normally um yeah it feels a bit harder it more complicated maybe maybe um be more slow I need to think more about it okay is there anyone at home with you no okay I should be worried about well I I concerned that some the symptoms you've got may be symptoms of a stroke. Okay, so that's something that can be dealt with but it needs to be dealt with as an emergency in the hospital. Should I call, would you be able to call the ambulance for me? I'm happy to do that. What we need to do is to make sure that they've got access to you when you come. So maybe you could leave the front door unlocked to sit in the hallway but I'm gonna arrange one of my colleagues next to me to call an ambulance to your home address now okay okay thank you that's being done right now as we speak while we're waiting for that I'm just gonna ask you a few more questions is that okay sure okay do you have any other illnesses at all I have type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure okay and I are you on any medication for that I'm taking melformin low certain and I'm low deep in okay do you have any allergies to any medication only penicillin I believe okay are there any illnesses in your family My dad has got heart disease but I don know more detail okay anyone else not really and are you normally living alone yes do you smoke at all I used to okay how much alcohol do you drink I will have a few drinks over the weekend, maybe a couple more during the week. So what drinks are we talking about? Beers like pints. Okay all right. How are you feeling now? Have you got the symptoms right now still? the arm yes yes the the arm still can't move and i think the speech is getting a bit harder okay all right so the ambulance is on its way all right um and what they're going to do is they'll probably take you down to um the local hospital a e and they will ring through for the um the stroke doctor to assess you to see whether they can give you any kind of um treatment for that okay so okay don't worry they're on their way um and what i'm going to do is i'm going to stay on the line until they reach there just to make sure that you're okay okay is there anything i should be doing now uh not at the moment no not at the moment just uh make sure that the the front doors open sit in the hallway by the front door so that they've got access if need to be if for any reason you can't open the front door okay okay all right then so i'm just gonna stay on the line and we'll and we'll wait until the ambulance comes.
