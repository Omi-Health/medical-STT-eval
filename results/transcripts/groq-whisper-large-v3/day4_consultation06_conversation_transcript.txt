Hello. Hello. Hi. My name is Dr. Kumar, one of the GPs here. Can I just get you to confirm your name and date of birth for me, please? Yeah, I'm Maria. Yeah. Date of birth? Sorry? And your date of birth? 27th of March, 2020. 27th of March of 90. Again, how can I help today? So I'm having like a really, really strong headache. I don't know what is happening. I'm quite concerned. So it started in the morning. I feel like dizzy. My vision is a little bit blurred. Like it's really painful and I'm getting really concerned, especially because I'm having like these changes in the vision. Okay, so it started this morning, was it a sudden onset headache? Did it come on suddenly? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, and did it come on really bad or did it start off like a slight headache and build up to a severe headache? It came like kind of suddenly. And if 10 is the worst pain you've ever felt your life how bad would you say the pain was between one and ten well I had the kidney stone so let's say that that's ten I have now maybe five well six six probably but it's more about me being really concerned because this is very weird okay now that's fine have you ever had a headache before sorry have you had a headache like this in the past? Well not really. Like this? No definitely it's something new. If you had to say where across the head the headache is, is it across the front, around the back? It's in one side, the left side only. And tell me what visual problems are you getting? My vision is quite blurred It really weird like some zigzag lines kind of I don know how to describe it properly okay and have you tried any painkillers for this already yeah I tried for a speed them all but didn't work to be honest I feel exactly the same okay okay what time did you take the paratitum or how long ago was it you taking it? Well the headache started like four hours ago so I would say like maybe three hours ago because I couldn't stand it. Okay and your visual problems are still ongoing now? Yeah yeah yeah I feel a little bit a little bit I cannot stand screens but yeah definitely and when I move like the thing is that if I if I leave bed I start to feel like even worse if I move so I just want to have my head my head like really not moving okay so what about have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit oh yeah oh I forgot to mention definitely I vomit twice actually as soon as the the headache started I also vomited so initially I thought it was something that I ate but then the headache started to be really bad and I still feel nausea still we are I'm about to vomit very soon I think all right okay you've mentioned in the past you've had kidney stones any other medical problems sorry you've mentioned that in the past you've had kidney stones have you had any medical problems in the past so not actually my mother has migraines I'm not sure if that's relevant and also I have hypothyroidism in the family so it might be I don't know I don't know what else do you have in the family I think we are losing connection sorry I I think we lost connection oh can you still hear me yeah yeah yeah you can hear me and you said you You mentioned your mother has migraines. What else do you have in the family? Hyperthyroidism. She also has hyperthyroidism. Okay, fine, okay. And no other relevant family history? No, not that I'm aware. And do you take any regular medications No Are you allergic to any medications Not that I aware Yeah not that I aware Okay is there any chance you could be pregnant I really doubt it. Fine. And so you're not allergic to any medications. Fine. And what were you thinking might be going on? I know you seem quite worried about was there anything in particular you were worried about well I'm a little bit hypochondriac so I feel that this can be some kind of brain tumor or something because I'm like this is really the pain is so horrible that or maybe a stroke I don't know it's it's just like you know you hear so many stories that you definitely start wonder if I should go to A&E urgently because I I might really have something serious. Okay. Okay, fine. Now, just another question. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs, anything like that? No, not really. No, no. And when you're walking, you're able to walk fine in a straight line, or are you walking a bit funny? Not really. Okay. It's really about the head. That's why I find it very weird. Okay. So just to clarify what you said this morning you woke up and then later on in the morning about four hours ago You've developed a headache On the left side of the head. Yeah left side of the head exactly behind the eye Sorry, is it behind the eye? Is that where the pain is? No, no, it's I don't know how to describe it but it's Kind of Okay, that's fine. You've noticed that your vision is blurry, there's funny lines, you feel a bit nauseous, you've vomited twice. Yes. And you're feeling dizzy as well, but you've got no neurological symptoms, you're walking fine, and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped. No. Okay. Yeah. So it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine. Is that something you've heard of before? No, it's the first time. I'm very familiar with the disease because my mother has it, so, well, but I never had it, and I thought that the onset of migraine will be, you know, in much early ages so that why I not sure if migraine makes sense Okay so usually with migraines they can present at different times in people lives so sometimes they can present as a child sometimes they can present when they're older and sometimes they can present you know even post-menopausally so there's different there's different ways you can get migraines and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head typical of a migraine you've got blurry vision again which is very typical with the nausea and vomiting that's also typical of a migraine now um the obviously if the headache is really severe and i'll suggest some medications you can try if that doesn't work we would want to see you and as soon as possible to do like a full neurological exam as well oh that's great to make sure that you know there's you know when we do a more specific examination that everything all seems fine um i would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you, it can take some medications maybe something like ibuprofen. Okay so and you're saying that if this is a migraine and if I try that medication this should go away kind of today? So yes a migraine yeah not you know even sooner than that we can look at maybe half an hour to 40 minutes depending on what your response to it is. For some people whatever medications they take the migraine doesn't improve and it can last from anywhere from four hours to 72 hours migraines can last um but i'll tell you okay that doesn't sound good no so what there's lots of medication treatments so there can be ibuprofen with an anti-sickness um so which you can get from the pharmacy um and you also to drink a sugary um carbonated drink something like coke okay so the three of them is a good sort of cocktail to start them then we can go up the treatment ladder you can get specific microleave medication and that's just something to try between now and when we see you to do the um to do the assessment okay some assessment where we can see you today at some point okay um but however if you do take these medications and you know by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself you can cancel it um you can give us a call and cancel it okay sounds good yeah okay so Sounds a good plan. Any questions for me? No, thank you very much. You were very helpful. All right, okay. Any further problems between now and your appointment, please do let us know. Okay, yeah. Thank you very much. Okay, bye. Bye.
