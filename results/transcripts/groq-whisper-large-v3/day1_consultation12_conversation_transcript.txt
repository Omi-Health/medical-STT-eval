I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about your diarrhea? Yeah, so it's been a very bad diarrhea. So it keeps me like I keep going back and forth to the toilet very often. Yeah, it started like three days ago. mm-hmm and so it started with vomiting so I vomited a couple of times but then that went away and yeah it's just diarrhea now okay and you mentioned you've been going to toilet very often how many times are you going a day around five to six times a day okay and can tell me I know it's not nice to talk about but is it quite watery your stools loose yes it's definitely watery loose stools any blood in your stools no not I could see okay and with the diarrhea have you noticed any other symptoms like tummy pain not not really no but I I I feel like I can't really drink too much, so I feel very dehydrated Okay when you say you can drink too much why is that Yeah because really I like I feel like I don drink enough Like I'm trying to drink, but then I just go to the loo and I boo everything and I feel dehydrated again. Okay, alright. Have you managed to eat anything solid? Not much, not much, just a little bit. I don't feel, I don't really feel like I have appetite. Okay, your appetite has reduced. Okay. With your, the vomiting has now stopped, is that right? Yes. Okay, alright. Have you had any other symptoms like fever or temperature? So not really, I feel a little bit warm, probably at the beginning I was feeling I had a bit of temperature but now I feel kind of fine. I feel very weak though. A little weak, okay, alright. Any headaches or muscle pains? Not really. Okay, alright. Alright. You mentioned three days ago, what were you doing when the symptoms started? Are you aware of any triggers? Not that I remember. What was I doing? I was at home, I was working on my computer and yeah, I just felt like some nausea and I had to vomit and then I had some diarrhea straight after that. Yeah. Did you have any takeaway food or any dodgy restaurant food? Not that I remember. Have you been around anyone unwell with diarrhoea recently, last week or so? Not that I know Right so moving on Are you otherwise fit and well yeah yeah okay and you take any regular medications so I I do suffer of asthma so I do have my nailers that I you know I I use in frequently let's say only when I have Is that the blue inhaler? Sorry? Is that the blue inhaler? Yes, it is, yeah. Blue inhaler, okay, all right. Any other medications that you take? No, nothing. Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medications? Not that I know of. Okay. And any family history of any medical problems? So my father used to have high blood pressure. he actually so he actually died of bowel cancer like 10 years ago okay it's already here that's um okay and what about your mother oh yes so uh probably is worth mentioning uh she has diabetes do we know if that's type one or type two uh it's type two okay all right fine and um just a little little bit more about your life in general sir who who's at home with you who lives at home with you sorry who lives at home with you sir oh I live alone you live alone okay are you currently working at the moment well I haven't been able to work in the past few days but yes like in my what's your employment what do you do for work I'm a software engineer all right have you Are you taking time off work recently? Yes yes I have These last three days I been feeling really unwell so I couldn work Okay all right and just last couple of questions regarding your smoking and alcohol Do you do either of those Not really I drink infrequently like socially let's say and I don't smoke. Okay. All right Fine so Robert I think having listened to your story, I think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis. Okay. Which essentially is just a tummy bug. It's an infection of your tummy. And normally lasts for about three to five days and gets better. All right. The things you can do to really help yourself get better soon are you can drink plenty of fluids, really try and flush the toxins out of your body. Okay. You can get things from the pharmacy which are called Diorolite, which can help replenish any minerals and vitamins you may have lost. Sorry, what's the name of that? It's called Diorolite. It's a type of fluid replacement drink. You can take some paracetamol if you're feeling feverish and weak. I would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for the next day or two until you get better. Okay. Normally you have to be diarrhea free for about 24 to 48 hours before you return back to work. Let's see how the next few days go. And if you're still not better next week, I want you to come back and see me. And we can have another look at your symptoms, okay? That sounds good. That sounds good. Thanks so much. Do you have any questions for me? No, I think that's fine. Yeah, I'll try to rest and drink plenty of fluid and I hope it goes away. If it doesn't, I'll call back. I really hope you get better soon. Thanks a lot. Thanks so much for your time. Bye bye. Okay, bye. Bye. Bye.
