Well, how can I help you this afternoon? Yeah, so I have soreness in my fingers, and my finger, like the skin on my hands is kind of cracked. Okay. When did this all start? A couple of months ago, like three, four months ago. Okay. So it's been that long, has it? Yeah. Okay. And so you mentioned your, is it the skin on your hands mainly that's dry? Yeah. I haven't noticed. I mean, I have dryness like, you know, in other parts like my legs, but it's not, it's not very, it's not severe. is just you know i've always you know i don't hydrate very much so right okay yeah like it's very bad in my hands okay can i ask why have you come to see me today is it because it's got worse recently your symptoms yeah i mean it's gotten to a point where where it hurts a lot and i can't really do my job so i thought i should probably get it checked out yeah that sounds like a very sensible plan and which part of your hands are affected mainly okay all right if you notice any itchiness in your palms yes you know all the time but yeah it does get itchy okay any bleeding at all I don't I mean no I don't think scratching yourself often and bleeding? Yeah I guess when I scratched it yes it has bled sometimes but yeah otherwise it hasn bled on its own Okay fine Okay sorry I just going to write notes as we go along And you mentioned the skin is quite cracked as well, is that right? Yes, that's right. Okay, all right. I know it's a long time ago, but do you remember how it all started? What were you doing at the time when it all started? Is it anything you may have done to bring your symptoms on? I mean I am I do work as a housekeeper and to be honest I'm not always very good about wearing gloves. I switched jobs four months ago. I've been working as a housekeeper for a while though but that's the only thing I can think of. Yeah I think that might be quite important actually, I think that's definitely maybe a correlation between the two um fine and so you mentioned something about having general dryness is that you mentioned your legs as well yeah sorry is that something you've you've had for a while now yeah it's not really it's not really major yeah it's just a little bit of dryness in my legs right okay okay i'm just gonna ask you some very brief yes or no questions that's okay with your symptoms have you have you had any other symptoms such as fever or temperatures any nausea or any vomiting no any problems with your bowels no and any problems with your urine waterworks otherwise you feel well do you and yourself you're eating drinking your appetite is well maintained? Yeah I feel good. Okay all right fine. In terms of your past medical history do you have any other conditions at all? I have diabetes. Do you know if that's type one or type two? Type two Diabetes okay Anything else No Any skin problems No Eczema dermatitis for example No, but I know I haven't been diagnosed. Okay, which medications do you take? Metformin. Metformin, okay. Do you have any allergies either to any medications or in general? No. Okay, family history wise is there anything I should be aware of diabetes and what diabetes as well okay again any skin problems any history of asthma or bowel problems no no okay all right fine in terms of social history you mentioned that you work as a housekeeper and you're not always very good at wearing gloves and you've recently changed jobs which what where which kind of places you work in is it mainly residential or is it commercial? It's a hotel. Hotel, okay. I do the whole thing like the bedroom, bathroom, toilet. Okay. Do you think there might be a relationship between the two between the kind of the products you're using and your symptoms? Yeah I usually use both for bathroom but yeah bedrooms and corridors not always. Okay have your symptoms stopped you from doing any work? Have you had to take time off work recently? Yeah like the past three days I haven't been able to go to work. Okay all right can I ask a couple of questions? Do you smoke at all? No. Do you drink much in the way of alcohol? A couple of pints a week. Once a week? A couple of pints a week. A couple of pints a week, okay, so very minimal alcohol there. Have you tried anything for your symptoms Have you tried anything over the counter Any creams Yeah I tried E45 Any luck with that? Yeah, no, I didn't really do anything. No, okay, alright. I also tried antihistamines, anti-histamine, but it didn't work. Okay, alright. Mrs. Parkinson, so I think, based on your story, I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis, which is very common in particularly people in your field who are using cleaning products, not using gloves. You can sometimes get a bit of a reaction between the chemicals and your skin. Moving forward, there's a couple of options. So firstly, what we try and do is avoid the trigger. So in your case, I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times. In terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin, we can try some steroid creams to help with inflammation as well as some stronger emollients which you really need to kind of coat on throughout the day, three or four times a day for the next couple of weeks just to help with the moisturizing of your skin. If it still hasn't got better in about a week to two weeks time, I really want you to back and see me again and we can maybe think about other things we can give to you okay is that all clear uh yeah that sounds good great do you have any questions for me um where do i get the medicines from oh so i'll i'll do a prescription for you now and send it over to your pharmacy okay great yeah uh so you said a couple of weeks it should get better i think a minimum couple of weeks uh 10 days to 14 days and if it still hasn't got better or indeed if it's getting worse if it's spreading or dryness is getting worse come back and see me sooner okay great thank you Laura thank you thank you very much bye bye now
