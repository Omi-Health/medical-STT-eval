Hello? Hi, hi. Hi, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you well. Hi, my name is Dr. Gohil. I'm one of the doctors that works at Babylon. Hi, doctor. My name is... Can I check your name and date of birth, please? Yes, my name is Roberto Mendoza. Okay. I was born on the 1st of January of 1992. Okay, and are you in a space that's quiet and you're able to talk? Oh sorry, I am... or 1990... sorry I'm 48, sorry I forgot that. So you're 48 and are you able to talk at the moment? Yeah, yeah. Okay, tell me, it says here you have a... you're having problems going to the toilet? Yes, so I have a, I don't know how to say it properly in English, I mean, it's like diarrhea. Okay. Yeah, so it's lasting for like three days. And yeah, I don't know, I don't know what would cause it. I have a bit of abdominal pain and I had a bit of vomiting. and yeah but these are kind of like what is happening to me. Okay, tell me how you were three days ago before this started. Did you have any medical problems? So I have asthma and I take some inhaler. I don't know. I take an inhaler and I have an allergy. I have NKDA allergy. I don't know if it's because I don't know. to be in hatred or yeah. And apart from asthma, do you have anything else? I don't know, maybe it's well, because you know, it's this thing here in the stomach and stuff. I always have in the back of my head of my father because he died about 10 years ago of cancer. Okay So yeah this is kind of my worries I don know So you had the diarrhea for three days and now you having pain and vomiting Yes, yes. Has the diarrhea been getting better or worse? I think it's not getting better or worse, it's kind of like normal. It hasn't gone away, it hasn't worsened. And how often do you go to the toilet? I go... I need to go... I can't go to work because I need to go like every... I don't know, it's this feeling like I go to the toilet and then when I finish I feel I need to go again. Okay. And yeah, so I need to be like close to the toilet. That must be hard. Yeah, yeah. Have you had to drink more water than normal? I don't know maybe I'm not drinking enough water yeah I drink I think I yeah I don't know I think I don't drink enough water an important question have you noticed any blood no I haven't noticed any and you mentioned tummy pain can you tell me more about your tummy pain like where it is and if it goes anywhere? So the pain is mainly focusing in the center area of the abdomen like under the belly, under the belly button and sometimes I can hear my stomach like the cramps. You've been able to eat and drink? Yes but I go to the toilet so often so I try not to eat a lot because I just go into the toilet every 10 minutes. And you said the tummy pain is in the middle of your tummy, does it go anywhere else? No, no, just there and it seems to be alleviated a bit in the toilet and maybe it's like gas, I don't know what it is but... Okay and when was the last time you vomited? I think it was this morning This morning But the thing is because I not eating anything now so I haven vomited again did you have any breakfast i don know i didn no sorry yes i did actually i did hold on i had some fruit i had some fruit okay and that and you vomited that up afterwards and afterwards i didn't have anything then i got a bit of nausea and i vomited and then yeah and that was it and that was it and i have any defense then so now i'm i think i'm okay but Did you notice any blood when you vomited? I think I do, but no, actually I can't say, sorry, I don't think there is blood because it was a strawberry that I was having for breakfast, so yeah, it wasn't blood. And three years ago, did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain? I don't know. To be honest, sometimes I have, when I get a bit of anxiety, I use my inhaler. But my inhaler kind of ran out the one because you know I'm a foreigner. So I have this brand, but I bought a new one here. And I don't know maybe this new one has caused this problem. I don't know. it's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this only it's when you eat bad food or food that has gone off and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested but just double-check have you noticed any problems with your breathing I always have problems with my breathing because of the asthma like when I take shot I need to use my inhaler a little bit but a part of the normal I haven't I haven't okay and how about chest have you noticed any chest pain no I haven't noticed any chest pain okay and how about walking and talking are those all both okay? Walking and talking yes yes but yeah I don't walk very far because I need to go to the toilet now and then so I spending some time at home And when you press on your tummy does it cause any pain Oh it does a little bit Okay Sorry, I was just writing some things down. Sure. So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain. Okay. And this is normally called gastroenteritis, enteritis so an infection over the tummy okay normally when patients have this do some things number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because you're losing lots at the moment number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers so if you start getting a temperature then you need to eat them all And number three is stay home for the time being until you get slightly better. Okay. And normally things like antibiotics don't help. They make the situation worse. Okay. So that's... I didn't... Yeah. Go ahead. Sorry. No, I was saying I didn't have any fever recently. I was sweating a little bit last night for bed, but I'm not sure if I had a bit of fever but very little or but I don't think so I don't think I don't know maybe so I think that what we should do for the time being if you feel you're getting much worse then I would suggest you go and see your GP in real in real life in person so they can look at your belly okay I will yeah I will book then I will wait a couple of days to see or one more day and then I will book. Great, cool. Do you have any more questions for me? No, that's it. I was maybe just concerned about my father's medical history, if that would could add some kind of risk. So the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had, but if your things don't get worse then that's something that we can look up from the gp okay does that sound okay yeah that sounds good that sounds good thank you thank you very much doctor for your time bye
