That's John Jones and your date of birth that's the 29th of September 1980 and your email address for me please that's John Jones at John Jones dot net okay and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation yep that's absolutely fine okay so you've mentioned on our notes that you're having a bit of a cough and a cold is that correct yeah yeah it's just it's been going on for like a few days now um sort of like coughing and like just you know general runny nose and stuff is it two to three days or longer uh about like five days around that yeah started like what day is it today uh yeah at the week it started at the start of the weekend so okay so so you started off with a cold did it yeah it sort of just like coughing and like running nose and like kind of muscles aching and stuff like occasionally feeling like cold chills and things like that Hot and cold yeah and so about your cough are you bringing up any phlegm at all No no it's like a it's like a dry cough it's sort of like like almost hacking hacking kind of like. You're not bringing up any blood are you? No. Okay are you feeling short of breath at all? No, no shortness of like yeah breathing fine. Yeah so you're not wheezy also, rattling noises in your chest? No. Okay right, so what have you taken so far? So just like painkillers and such, I mean in addition to like my normal medication and such. So you mentioned, you've come to your normal medications, but you've mentioned you've taken some painkillers, like, could you tell me the names please? I would just like paracetamol. Paracetamol, okay. Any ibuprofen at all? No. No, okay. And also, you mentioned some regular medication. Unfortunately, I don't have your medical, complete medical history. So if you could tell me what your medications are and what you use them for? Yeah so I take metformin I a diabetic and I also yeah for the like because of my blood pressure yeah okay and how long have you been a diabetic for um like a few years maybe five or six years five six years okay okay do you monitor your blood triggers at home yes okay And how have they been doing at the moment? No issues, nothing like out of the ordinary there. Okay, so there's no problems with your blood pressure control at the moment, even though you're not okay, so that's absolutely fine. And when was the last time you took your blood pressure? I've been this morning. This morning, and what was it, what was the readings like? I can't remember off the top of my head, but it was within the normal range. There was nothing alarming, yeah, normal, okay. Okay, that seems all right. Okay, so can I hypothetically look into your mouth? Yeah? Sure. Yeah? Yeah, okay, so looking into your mouth, there's just a bit mild redness at the back of your throat. There's no enlarged tonsils. Can you feel any glands around your neck at all No No I haven had anything like that OK So it looks like it just a viral infection because it just a cold and a cough. There's nothing there. And generally, if you have things like a chest infection, you would have a bit like a wheeze or shortness of breath. So things that we would recommend is you can use the, you know, night nurse, day nurse. It's still okay with your medications, yeah? so I'm sure you are a bit wary to use them but it's still okay with your current medication you can still use that might be able to make you feel a bit more better quickly if there's any change like you're feeling short of breath or the your symptoms are lasting more than three weeks or something or you're becoming poorly uh things like that then you need to get in touch with us then probably we might need to examine you and especially your chest but I don't think so that's necessary at this point in time. Okay that sounds good. Okay any questions at all? No I think that's been very helpful thank you. Okay so just to round up just use the night nurse, day nurse, if any change in your symptoms like shortness of breath, wheezy or symptoms are lasting more than three weeks then get in touch with us. Okay so I don't need any prescription or anything? well you don't need anything at the moment okay take care then thank you very much
