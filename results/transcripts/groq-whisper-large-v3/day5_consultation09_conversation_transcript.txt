Hello. Hi there, it's Dr Smith from Babylon. Hi there. Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address please? Yeah, it's Matt Carter and it's 14th August 1989. And what was the last bit? Your address. And it's 1 Babylon Avenue. And are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today? Yes. What can I do for you? I don't really know what's been going on but it's just aching all over. Definitely the last six weeks it might have been slightly longer than that but it's just sort of that feeling really tired, run down. Okay so when do you think you were last well? Where are we now? We just started in April. Definitely Christmas, New Year, I felt relatively well, I think. So since then. Actually, yeah, I was on holiday in the States and yeah, it probably coincided with sometime around then, end of January, start of Feb. So do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back? Probably a couple of weeks after I got back. Were you well when you were on holiday? Yeah, I had a great time, very active. Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhoea, vomiting, anything like that? No, not that I recall. Yeah, not, no, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards. Okay, so just tell me what symptoms you've been having. In terms of just your general health, any persistent cold symptoms or earaches, sore throat, chest cough, shortness of breath, phlegm, anything like that? No. Any change in your weight at all? I don't think so. I'm probably less hungry, but no weight change, just a bit. Are you eating different amounts? Yeah probably slightly smaller portions or yeah more of an effort to actually eat everything that in front of me any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat or abdominal pain no any change in your bowel habit diarrhea vomiting or blood in the stool uh no any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine No, that's all fine. Okay and any other general symptoms like rashes? I don't have any rashes now. In fact I've got a photo on my phone if that's helpful. I can try and show you, hang on. Because this, yeah this was weird, this sort of came up and then disappeared after a couple of weeks. that wasn't the light, I don't know. Okay, whereabouts was it? I think sort of calf, back of my calf, because I didn't notice it, my wife noticed it actually. When did you first notice it? Probably around the end of February, the middle to end of February, And then it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time. And it faded over a couple of weeks, I guess. Did you have any fevers at that time? To be honest, that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat I had. So possibly a little bit feverish, but I sort of put it down to that. Do you know where you got that when it started? Had you been walking? Did you get any bites that you noticed? I do quite a lot of walking and we did quite a lot while we were out on holiday as well. But definitely, yeah, I mean, I don't recall anybody, I don't remember seeing anything fitting, but you often like, yeah, as you're walking through, I was in shorts and boots. Whereabouts were you in the States? Just sort of near Yosemite. Okay. And any headaches, blood, vision, tingling, numbness? No. Sort of headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy And have you been able to go to work as usual I been going to work I don know how effective it's been but yeah. What's your job? I work for a health technology company actually. Okay and has your concentration been affected or your tiredness levels in the daytime at work? Yeah definitely sort of tired and um yeah less energy sort of probably less engaged than I I would normally be have you been able to exercise okay um not as much I I don't know if it's I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it I'm not exercising as much as I would normally okay right and um How's your mental health, your stress levels? I'm pretty good at the moment, actually. Like previously, that has been an issue. But other than sort of physically feeling a bit crappy, I'm in a pretty good place. OK. Apart from that rash, any other rashes on your skin or swelling of your joints or pain in your joints? Yeah, sort of aching shoulders, back, hips, knees, but sort of, yeah, not everything. Any swelling that you've noticed? No. Hands, wrists, ankles, toes? No. Okay. And any other significant medical problems in the past? I mean, hazy birds, I think. Pardon? asthma and hay fever if they count okay any flowers you've got asthma recently uh no pretty well controlled do you take any regular inhalers or other medication uh yeah i've got one of those um preventives i think yeah um quite the day but i've not used one you haven't been used yet i have i've been using the every day for the morning and night but not the uh okay and any um do you take any other medications um i i think um one of the anti departments it might be kerosene Can I get that from the pharmacy Yeah that fine And do you smoke No Drink any alcohol No. Sorry, occasionally that one. Okay and who do you live with at home? Just my wife. Sorry. So with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, it's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels. I think it's important to get some blood tests checking all the normal things like liver, kidneys, blood count etc but also some more specific things like bacterial infection you can sometimes get including one that you can get which can produce a rash like that, so that would involve blood tests, are you happy to do that? Yeah I'm generally happy with blood tests, what's the infection? Well you can get a can get bacterial infection caused which is called um it's called Lyme disease that you can get a rash from a tick bite so that's something we would do a test for as well and if that comes back positive then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it so it's definitely worth checking for but we would also check just for other things which can cause reduced energy tiredness and aching but persistent over six weeks. Okay. So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line and then when you've had the test arrange a follow-up about a week after after you've had the test done. Okay so do the test first and then and that follow-up we can just do over the phone again? Yeah yeah we can do that over the phone to start with. Okay excellent. Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you very much. Any other questions? Oh, sorry, you broke up a bit there. Any other questions? Oh, no, not, no. Okay, that's great. Take care. Take care. Thank you. Bye. Sorry.
