Hi there, it's Dr. Smith from Babylon. Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address please? Yes, my name is Mary Jo, date of birth is January 1st, 1980 and my address is 60 Sloane Avenue, London. Okay, are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today? Absolutely. What can I do for you? So a couple of things. I think I may have overdone my workouts and now my knees are hurting and they're clicking a lot and it's starting to worry me. I can't run very far anymore without just feeling pain in my knees. And then sometimes I also get this weird tingling in my toes. So yeah, that's it. I'm just concerned and I figured I'd call and see if you can help me figure out what's going on. that's fine so when do you think it started so probably it's been about two weeks okay and and any joint problems before that you know not not really I mean I play a lot of sports and I had like I play some ice hockey and I had this injury a few months ago you know I just like fell on the ice and and you know had a huge bruise but I think that's about it okay so at the moment just tell me about the exercise that you're doing normally so I'm training well I'm currently training for a marathon it's gonna happen in June and so I'm trying to run like I mean right now I'm actually not even doing such long runs maybe like seven or eight miles and so I started about maybe a a month ago. I've done like, you know, four or five miles and I've just done like a couple of seven mile runs. And then, and then, you know, I go to the gym like three times a week and kind of do my usual routine. But yeah, I think the only thing that's really different has have been the runs, the longer runs. And have you had any times when the knee feels like it's giving way underneath you? Well, what do you mean by that? I'm not sure what it means. So it means if you're there and you just feel it sort of jolt, like give way, feel unstable underneath you? Not that. I mean, it just kind of starts hurting, you know? And does it hurt? How far into the run does it generally hurt? You know I would say it probably starts like after maybe 20 minutes or so which is probably I don know like somewhere around mile three maybe two and a half or three miles Okay, oh, you're fast. Maybe I'm switching my kilometers and miles, I'm not sure, sorry. And do you have to stop running or can you run through the pain? Yeah, that is a good question. So, you know, the last few times, The last time I actually stopped, I mean I ran a little bit longer, but then I stopped because it was, I feel like it's getting worse. When I started doing my abs, when I do my abs it kind of required me to move my, to kind of go from the flex position of my knees and straighten my legs. Then I hear all this clicking and I think that also freaked me out and I just figured something's wrong. You said before it's both knees? So it's more, it's actually my right knee that hurts. Any problems with your left one? No. Okay. Can you just describe in the knee or show me whereabouts the pain is happening mainly? So you know, I feel it, it's kind of weird. I feel it in the middle, but I almost feel like maybe it kind of moves to the right of my knee a little bit. Okay. any tenderness when you press over any areas in the knee? So yes, well, I have probably some fluid. I Googled it and you know, it says that sometimes fluid accumulates. Okay, does it look swollen to you? Sorry? Does the knee look swollen? Well, it did, like the first time I ran, it was a little bit swollen, but then I just put some like ice on it and it went away. But right now, right now it's not swollen and right now it doesn't hurt, you know? But it just kind of comes on when, or you know, right now when I flex and extend my leg there's no clicking, but I'll notice it in the gym and then, you know, when I run it will start hurting. Okay, and if you're sitting still for a while, do you have any problems when you stand up, any locking up of the knee? Nope. Can't straighten it. Any problems going up and down stairs? No. Any problems just walking normally? No, not. I don't. And in terms of range of movement, are you able to fully straighten the leg? Yes. And what about fully flex it? Yes. Okay. Are you taking any medication for the knee? Well, since you're asking, yes, I take ibuprofen. And I just kind of use it sometime like sometimes I have some joint you know that kind of is not very frequent So I take ibuprofen for that but you know it nothing like major maybe Like 400 milligrams max something like that. I also sometimes will you know smoke a joint and Yeah, I didn't that that's it okay, and any other joint problems that you're getting any back pain more swelling of your hands, feet, elbows, wrists, any pain? Well, I have sometimes, you know how sometimes like if you stand for a long time, your feet will kind of, or your legs will swell up. Like I notice it because of my socks. I'll just kind of notice this invitation. And then another weird thing, I felt this just once, but there was this tingling in my toes, like after the run, there was tingling in my toes, like on my, you know, my right toes. So. On your right side? Yes. Any change in color or temperature of your lower legs? Nope. Any swelling which stays if you push in and then you release it, that it stays there? Well, I don't know if I really try that, but I will tell you that what I notice is like if I, you know, when my socks come off, I kind of notice that indentation a little bit. I mean, it's not like major, right? But I mean, do you mean I just need to like press and see what happens if it like kind of stays or? yeah or any pain in the back of the calf or anything like that no nothing like that no and and with your foot has that gone back to normal now do you feel any altered sensation tingling numbness and then like that no it was just it was that time uh but it was just really weird because it kind of went on for a while okay and any pain in the joints of your foot or on the underside in the arch any problems walking around on hard floors no okay have you had any other medical problems before well I had you know just kind of your garden variety stuff right cold and I mean I do have I'm farsighted and so I had I had lasik surgery and then once I had this really bad UTI they thought it was kidney stones and so they had me actually in ER and if my GP didn't call them tell them that you know they don't need to give me morphine um that was kind of an awesome experience but uh other than that you know I'm I'm I'm pretty good okay do you take any other medications apart from the ones you told me about well I'll take uh I take vitamin d uh I take melatonin sometimes you know just for cramps i take like uh um ibuprofen or actually a sit and i take what am I taking a leave whatever I leave is I think that maybe set and mean of in or I can't remember what class of drugs you know occasionally if I'm really having hard times like I'll sleeping I'll take Xanax but I prefer melatonin it's just sometimes melatonin doesn't work okay and any problems of your stomach or asthma indigestion no problems um what i would suggest is definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using so as much as you can because that really does make a difference to injuries brings the healing blood into the area and it gives it the best chance of getting better so as much as you can use the ice um obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon program but I would try and ease up on the running if you can and if it's painful enough that you're having to stop running then it's not a good idea to do that. It's fine to take the ibuprofen, I can prescribe you a slightly stronger anti-inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the ibuprofen but not with the ibuprofen but make sure you do that with food. ultimately we probably need to examine the knee so the best thing I would suggest getting an appointment with the physiotherapist first you can do like a long assessment and examination of the knee and then make an assessment as to whether we need to do any imagery to have a look inside the knee and see if there's any problem with the cartilage well you know I read some stuff online that that maybe like my ligaments there's I think it's like ACL or something like that right and so if that I mean I'm kind of like freaked out that they may break so do you think it's that or and it's it's not really possible to diagnose that over the fight over the video so we definitely would need to see you and the physio is the best point of call because they'll probably be the most initial treatment but certainly appointment times too long to wait then we can see we can see you as well can you sorry going to send referral for that yeah if we can all that if in the meantime you develop like persistent swelling heat redness and if the knee or high temperature feel unwell or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it you need to see a doctor to urgent need so call us back in that case good thank you yeah sure I mean give me the stronger meds and I'll give that a try okay I'll send it through to your pharmacy for you thanks so much
