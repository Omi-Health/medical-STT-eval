Hello. Hello. Hi, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please? Michael John. And your date of birth? 09-29-83. Okay. And your address for me, please? 231 Leonard London Street sorry London okay and that's correct and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation yes okay you've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea I'm sorry to hear about it so if you tell me a bit more about it please it's been happening for about three days now okay Yeah, it started off, I don't know, it's something that I thought would go away pretty quickly. I've had that from time to time after eating certain types of food or going on certain travels. But nothing funky in my diet or no travels recently. And it just kind of kept up. I'm a bit confused as to what to do. So you haven't had anything from outside, nothing dodgy, anything but no? No, no, no, no. Just a little bit. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's pretty standard diarrhea where there's like a little bit of abdominal pain. I threw up once. I don't know if that was a little worrying. Repeat that piece. That wasn't clear. What did you say? I threw up once. After that, we said something. nothing else was worrisome okay right and with the diarrhea how many times a day are you going to the toilet uh four to five four to five times yeah and is there any and it's like water is it like water or is it just loose what do you mean are you going like water or is it just you know bit bit of solid stools with loose kind of thing It probably depends on the time of day to be honest A bit of both A bit of both And is there any blood or mucus? No blood. What do you mean mucus? It's like the snotty stuff. In the stool? Yeah. It looks like snot. No. No. So no mucus. Okay. Any fever at all? Maybe a little bit but it hasn't been that in particular hasn't been too worrying. Are you still able to eat and drink? A little bit of appetite loss I guess versus the normal. Okay. But also not something I'd like if that was alone I wouldn't have reached out. So but you're still able to drink quite a bit yeah you're drinking plenty yeah yeah yeah okay mostly to try and rid okay and what have you take have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea nothing yet nothing yet okay anything for the abdominal pain nothing yet okay right and any unfortunately we don't have any of your past medical history is that anything you'd like to say uh i probably had asthma um or or i don't know i guess i still have it okay and are you any anything else other than asthma uh my dad had hypertension okay as hypertension yeah hypertension yeah he died of bowel cancer 10 years ago oh yeah okay bowel cancer 10 years ago and how old was he when he died? 62. Okay and you mentioned you had asthma are you using any inhalers at all? Yes. Which ones? Lexapro. Sorry? Lexapro. Yes Okay not heard of it I mean is it like salbutamol is it like a blue color yellow yellow okay i have to check that one not sure laxipro okay um that's fine any other medication that you're using over the counter anything at all No. Okay, right. Any allergies? Nothing, yeah, nothing. No allergies at all, right here. Fine. So obviously, you know, you just have diarrhea, it's about four to five times a day. You're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated which is a good sign okay um when we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day that means probably you are you know whatever you're eating is going straight through okay you still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids okay when you go to the toilet um things that one would advise is a soft diet so avoid dairy, fish, meat, eggs while you're having the diarrhea. Go. Sorry? What is a soft diet? What does that mean? Like outside of not those things, what do you mean by soft? Okay, so that will be like crackers, toast, jam, those kinds of things that's easily digested. Like what we would give babies, yeah? When they start eating, you give simple food for babies. You don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding. So that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about. Once you are able to keep most of it in, you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash. Once you're OK with that for about 48 hours, then you can start having meat. So just don't have meat immediately once you feel like you're slightly better, because you might go back to square one again. All right? What do you mean OK with that diet? Like once? For 48 hours, you're not having any diarrhea, you're fine. Then you can go and start having meat egg fish and all So that when you can go If the diarrhea is getting better but isn getting or do you want it to go away completely at that point or if it like trending up no no no you preferably just don because why do we say this is because it takes much more time for me to get digested so because your gut flora you know the the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food while it doesn't take that much of an effort to you know digest mash and vegetables does that make sense yes yeah so at the same time you could have some although you can't milk is not a good idea yogurts are a good idea because they are probiotics it helped to build up the normal gut bacteria back okay so those kind of now things to look out for if your diarrhea doesn't go away in a week's time or if you're passing blood we need a stool sample because that means you might you may have one some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics okay okay if If you, again, as I've mentioned previously, if you're going about six to eight times a day, that means there's a high chance that you are having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time. If that happens, do get in touch with us again. All right? Okay. Any questions? You look a bit confused. No, that's it. Yeah? Okay. and also you could get something called dire light over the counter so it helps to replenish your the salts that you've been that's lost through going to the toilet okay okay if you're a bit confused you know you can actually all this is all recorded in your app so you can't go back I'll put that all in detail so if you know I know sometimes it's bit difficult to process everything you can go back and read the notes. Is that okay? That's great. All right then. You take care. Bye. Bye now. Bye-bye.
