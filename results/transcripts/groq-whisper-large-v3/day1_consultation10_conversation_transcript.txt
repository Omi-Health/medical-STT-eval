next door hello hi can you hear me okay yeah i can hear you right excellent before i go any further can i confirm your name and your age please sure um i'm amanda jackson and i'm 19 years old 19 years old okay amanda and how can i help you this afternoon um so it's been going on for a few days now um it's not happened before and i'm a bit worried it hurts when i kind of pee and yeah it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more and it's really like I can't like go to uni properly and just like constantly looking for the toilet um it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in the bottom of my tummy as well right I'm sure there's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you and so you mentioned you've been going for the last three days mainly the burning pain when you pass urine you go to the toilet more often as well Yeah, it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days I think actually, maybe just under a week. Oh under a week, sorry. Sorry, I didn't explain it properly before. Yeah, it's been going on for about just under a week and yeah I notice sort of burning, stinging when I go to the toilet. Have you noticed anything in your urine, for example any blood or discolouration of urine? I think well today I noticed it was like a bit pink the urine yeah I think just today any kind of frank blood I mean red blood at all in your urine I think it was I don't know it was pink so okay fine we'll definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on you also mention some tummy pain as well can you tell me a bit more about that pain yeah it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy mainly when I go to the loo I think that's when it's worse okay can you describe it in crampy pain is there more of a burning pain I wouldn't describe this crampy I don't think it's like a period pain it's a bit different it's it's hard to say an achy pain I suppose Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back, towards your sides? No. No, no. Okay alright Any other symptoms at all for example nausea vomiting No no nausea vomiting Any temperatures or fevers No not that I noticed Okay all right and how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working okay? I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway so I don't think it's any different than what it usually is. We wouldn't say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have? I think I have IBS, so I just kind of pass my bowels like quite a lot and sometimes it's quite variable, like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, sorry this is a bit disgusting, but like sometimes it's a bit harder and kind of hard to predict. Okay, alright, but you notice no new symptoms in your bowels? No, no, not that I can say. Alright. And Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite extensive questions as you can imagine. Can I ask, are you currently sexually active at the moment? Yeah, I have a long-term boyfriend. Okay. And have you noticed any other discharge from down below, so from the front passage? No, I don't think so. Nothing unusual. Do you use any form of contraception? Yeah, I'm on the pill. What kind of pill is it? Is it a combined pill or the mini pill? Combined pill. Okay, fine. When was the last time you had unprotected sex? I mean I mean unprotected is it like no no condoms or anything yeah exactly I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend just like I don't know we've just kind of agreed so I guess a week what I'm trying to get at is whether there's any chance you could be pregnant at all I know you're on the pill, but nonetheless we do have to ask. When was your last period? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago. Okay. All right. Just something for us to bear in mind. If your symptoms don't get any better, okay? Fine. In terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you eating and drinking okay Yeah yeah eating and drinking okay I did have one kind of concern I don know so I smoked, this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time like a week and a half ago. I just wonder whether it's related at all, probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. Sure, well thanks for sharing with me. So I don't think it is related to your symptoms, I think it's probably just pure coincidence, but you know I do strongly advise you to you know make it a regular habit if you can, just for your general health moving forwards. Okay, moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions apart from the IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of? No. No? Okay, great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the combined pill? Apart from the pill, I take something for the IBS as well. It begins with an M, it's pretty hard to pronounce, like meh-beh-something. Meh-beh-meh-beh. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Okay, and then after the cramps, the crampy pain? Yeah. Yeah, okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications? Yeah, I think there was an antibiotic called clindamycin that I took a couple of years ago, and yeah, that didn't go too well with me. Right, okay, sure, I'll make a note of that. In terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? No. No, well, Jenny, anything else? Good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? So I am living in halls at the moment, uni, so I'm just living with a flatmate I suppose, but my family live kind of outside of London, not too far away, so yeah, my family are fine and I see them now and then. Very good. Yeah, things are okay generally. Great, and what are you studying at university? I'm studying English. English, okay, good, and how are you enjoying your course? Yeah, it's going well, thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago. I really enjoy it. Very good In terms of smoking and alcohol do you participate in either As I admitted before I tried weed the first time but I don smoke I drink occasionally socially with friends. What made you have your first joint last week? I was just a party, there were other people doing it, I kind of was a little bit tipsy, so probably wasn't thinking quite straight, but yeah, I completely agree, it's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure, and obviously as your doctor's family took after you, so I would strongly recommend you to avoid it. Great, fine, so at this stage I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think I'm reassured by the fact that I think it's probably just a simple what we say a UTI or a cystitis, bladder infection. You know you haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me that there's anything to worry about so things like fevers and back pain would be more worrying for me to hear. So something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics, so we've got choices to antibiotics something called trimethoprine or nitrofurantoin which is a three-day course normally they're usually quite effective for your symptoms it's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well if you can so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there start the antibiotics make sure you're well hydrated drink plenty of fluids if you are having some pain simple paracetamol would probably be advisable and we'll see what the urine sample shows and if it is indeed positive we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones but if things are still not getting better next week come back and see me and we can have another look again okay okay great with the urine sample and how do I go about doing that? No, well good question, so I will give you, I will organise for you to come in and drop off a sample at one of our practices which we can test there and then whether you're in distance and obviously the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results. Okay perfect. Okay great. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting if you have any of those give me a call okay. Fever, back pain, vomiting, great Okay, yeah. Okay. Have a good day. Okay. Great, thank you. You too. Bye-bye.
