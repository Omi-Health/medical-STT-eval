Hello. Hi there, good morning. Hi. I'm Dr Dean Meagher from Groupier Hand, nice to see you. Nice to see you, hello. Hi, so before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth, if that's okay? Yes, Mary Richards, and I'm 40 years old. So, you're 40 years old you said, yeah? Perfect, okay. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yep. Okay, great. So how can I help you today? So I've just been having some problems with my hearing. I can't really hear very well and I've noticed that my face has been feeling a bit numb recently. Right, okay. And how long has this been going on for? It's been a few weeks now, about three weeks or something. Right, okay. And is this just on one side or both sides? Just one side, just on my left side. I've noticed that the hearing's gone down a bit. Right, okay. And your face is feeling numb. Where exactly is that? Which part of your face? Can you show me with your finger? Yeah, so again it's the left side, it's kind of like around my left ear and kind of along here, so like my jawline's just all feeling a bit numb around here. Right, okay. Has anything else happened in this time? Any other symptoms you've had at all? Not that I've noticed. I think occasionally noticed some ringing in my ear. Some ringing in your ear, okay. yeah sure okay and have you had any weakness or numbness down the in the rest of the body at all no no no nothing like that Okay Have you had any difficulties swallowing No And have you had any difficulties speaking No no Have you noticed any problems with your vision at all? No, that's all good. Okay. And do you have the numbness present right now? Yeah, it's kind of there quite often, like all the time. So yeah, right now it feels very, doesn't feel like when I touch this side of my face. Sure, okay, alright. Just going back to the kind of muffled hearing feeling in the ear, do you have any discharge coming from that ear at all? No, nothing, nothing coming out. Any pain in the ear or from the ear? No. Right, okay. And have you had any fever at all? No, nothing like that. And do you have any itchiness in the ear? Do you use cockles or buds to clean your ears out? I don't, oh no no no, don't use cockles or buds. Alright, alright. I need to ask a few other general questions. Do you have any other illnesses at all? I've been told I've had polyps in my nose in the past and occasionally get some kind of half-Bernie feeling. That's all fine and you know I take a Rennies if I need to and if my noxious polyps are playing up I've got a spray. Other than that I think they said ages ago I had something called, I can't quite remember, but labyrinthitis, something like that but again nothing, nothing on there. Sure okay so are you on any regular medication? You mentioned the spray for your nose. Yeah so I know I only take the spray for my nose when I need it for and sometimes over like Rennie but I just get that from the chemist Sure And the spray for your nose where do you get that from Is that from a doctor Yeah they gave me a prescription ages ago Yeah Do you remember the name of the spray at all Unfortunately I don sorry That alright And you're not on any other medication at all? No. Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medication? No just latex. Latex okay all right that's good to know. And in terms of your family are there any kind of illnesses within your family My brother had neurofibromatosis I think it is. Other than that everyone else is okay. Okay good. And in terms of your own kind of background now, are you working at the moment? Yeah so I'm a jockey but because of all the kind of symptoms I'm getting, especially sometimes when I get a ringing I can feel a bit dizzy, I've just had to do far less training so kind of beginning to yeah impacting work a little bit now okay so you have to excuse my ignorance you mean jockey like with horses is that what you're talking about yeah all right okay fine great and do you live alone I live with my partner Okay, right. Do you have any pets at all at home? No, no pets. Okay, fine. Fantastic. All right. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what's been going on recently? No, just like I said, like ringing occasionally and when I get back and sometimes feel a bit dizzy, but the main thing is really the lack of hearing and the numbness that's got me upset. Just, yeah, no idea what's going on there. Okay, fine. All right. So what I think we've gone. It was just like there was one thing I think that because I can panic and you can look online and get a bit frantic I guess what I trying to think is you know is there something particularly serious that you know will need to be sorted and obviously reading anything could make you really frantic is it hopefully nothing so serious I would die from it I don't know I just I think obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via video portal but from what you've told me this doesn't seem to be anything that you're going to die from however I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today okay I would like you to come into one of my clinics I'd like a GP to assess you what you're describing might be something called Bell's palsy yeah we can go into that explaining what that is if if that's confirmed on physical examination that's not usually a life-threatening problem but part of the reason why I'd like you to come in is just that we can do what we call a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on and confirm whether that might be the diagnosis, have a look inside the ear see if there's anything to see within the ear. So in answer to your question no I don't think that you need to worry about that I think you know preliminarily I can I can reassure you however in order to definitively reassure you I think you need a physical examination today okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to send a message to our admin team I'll ask them to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics within central London okay and then you can ring the support team number I'll leave that number in your notes you can ring them after five minutes and then they'll slot you into a place that's convenient for you okay that's fine all right so someone will see you and hopefully we'll be able to reassure you further but please make sure the appointment gets done today okay yep they will do that's fine thank you very much all right okay nice to see you take care bye
