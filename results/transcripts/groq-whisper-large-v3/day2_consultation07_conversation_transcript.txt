Hi there, good morning. Hi, good morning. I'm Dr Dean Meza from GP at Hand, nice to see you. Nice to see you too. Okay great, so before we start your appointment, could you please confirm your full name and date of birth? Yeah sure, my name is Tim Gowers, and I was born in 1958 on the 8th of August. That's great, thank you so much for that. You look a lot younger, so. That would make you roughly about 50 years old, 51 years old, is that correct? Yeah, around that, yeah, about 60, yeah. 60, okay, perfect. Alright, so nice to see you this morning. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes, I am, yeah. Okay, fantastic. So how can I help you today? Yeah, I was having a bit of chest discomfort. So I was doing some gardening a couple of hours ago, and I felt not exactly a pain, but like a pressure on my chest. It feels like someone's sitting on my chest. And I've noticed a bit of nausea, no vomiting, but I'm pretty sweaty, short of breath. and it kind of feels like someone's sitting on my chest. Right, okay. Now, do you have these symptoms right now or have they gone off now? No, they're still present. Okay, so you've still got the chest discomfort right now? Yes. Okay. We're probably going to have to call an ambulance for you. Okay. Okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to task my coddy next to me to sort that out. while we do that I going to ask you a few more questions okay a bit more information to the ambulance team when they when they arrive okay I know so just just to double check where exactly in the chest is the pain um it's in the middle of my chest over yeah my pecs so yeah but not not necessarily to one side I mean it's quite a diffuse pain is it spreading anywhere else I can't you arm up to the jaw and the neck and you have that? Yeah, it's mainly in my left arm. It's feeling a little bit painful and in my shoulder as well. Right, okay. Do you remember what you were doing at the time? Yeah, so it started just when I was gardening, so nothing that was too strenuous. I was just kneeling down and yeah, wasn't running or anything. It wasn't during any physical exercise. Okay, and how much activity do you do normally? Do you walk a lot or do you run or do you go to do anything? No, I don't. I generally don't do much activity at all. Have you had this before? No, this is the first time actually. Right, okay. Are you aware of any palpitations, like your heart beating faster or more prominently than normal? Yeah, it's beating a bit faster now. I think that's because I'm a little bit stressed about the situation, but I haven't noticed it beating faster than usual today. So I know you're stressed. We've got an ambulance coming on the way, okay? Yeah. So we'll take care of everything, so don't worry. Okay. Is anyone in the house with you at the moment? No, no one's in the house at the moment. Okay. And is your front door open? Yes, it's open. Okay, so maybe we'll speak maybe in the hallway to the front door. Have the front door open so that in case people need access they can access you Yeah All so um are you a smoker at all ah yeah I smoke a fair bit so I smoke about 10 cigarettes a day yeah how long we've been smoking for ah for the past 15 years yeah do you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol diabetes yeah I have high blood pressure but not diabetes. Okay have you ever had your cholesterol checked? No. Okay all right now anyone in your wider family, in your family sorry, in your parents did either of them have any heart problems or heart attacks or anything like that? Yes so my father died of a heart attack and my mother had some heart problems. Okay I'm sorry to hear about your father, can you remember what age roughly he was when he had that heart attack um he was about my age right so just under six around 60. yes around 60 yes okay all right um do you drink much alcohol um yeah i drink um about per week probably about seven or eight pints a week okay is that a beer you're talking about oh yeah yes um i i can't tell from the video are you overweight um yes i'm overweight yeah right all right um uh now um you're do you normally live alone uh yeah i live alone uh at the moment yeah uh it's just me in the house sure okay and are you working at the moment yeah yeah i i work yeah What do you work as? I work as a restaurant owner, so I own a sushi shop. Right, okay. Yeah. All right So the symptoms that you described to me they indicate the possibility of a heart attack Okay. So I'm not saying you definitely have a heart attack, but that's our number one priority to exclude that. Okay. So the ambulance team will be with you very shortly. I'm going to stay on the line with you until they come. Okay. Okay. Yeah, thank you. When they come, what they'll do is they're going to put some stickers on your chest and do an ECG. Okay. I've already specified where to take you after that, okay? Okay. And what, can I just double check, do you have any allergies to any medication? Yes, actually I have an allergy to aspirin. Right, okay. Yeah, and no other allergies. Sure. What's the nature of that allergy to aspirin? Does it cause you heartburn or is it like an allergic reaction? Yeah, it's an allergic reaction so I swell up a bit but nothing life-threatening. I sometimes even have it and it's a mild reaction to it. Okay, all right. It's very important that you communicate that to the hospital, the detail you've just told me because we may need to consider aspirin despite the allergy. All right. Now, in terms of what happens from here, the team will assess you and then they may take you into one hospital or another based on how bad, what the ECG looks like and what kind of treatment you might need. OK. OK. What I'm going to do is we'll stay on the line for the time being. OK. Until they come. And then once they come, then I'll hand over to them and explain what's going on. All right. OK. OK, sure. OK. Thank you. And the conversation now for the purpose is? Yeah. Is that okay? Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Thanks. Bye. Thank you. Bye.
