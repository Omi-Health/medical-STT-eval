Hi there, good morning. Hello. I'm Dr Dean Mizner from GP at Hand, nice to see you. Gladly to meet you. Okay so before we start your appointment could I please confirm your full name and date of birth? My name is Tracy Chaplin and my date of birth is... Just tell me how old you are. I'm 45. Okay, could you confirm the first line of your address and your postcode? 15 Babylon Street, W65. Okay thank you. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yes. Okay, fantastic. Alright so tell me what's been going on, you said you were a bit short of breath, is that right? Yeah, yeah, feeling very sort of breathless recently. Like I I don't know, whenever I like breathe deeply, it sort of catches in the right hand side of my back. Right, okay, okay. And how long has this been going on for now? Just a day really. Right, okay. Any other symptoms at the same time that you've had this pain? Well, I've got a bit of a slight fever and I coughed up a bit of blood on two occasions. Right, okay. I'm not sure what that means. Okay, all right, it might all be connected then. And yesterday, before all of this, were you completely fine? Yeah, yeah, kind of. I could sort of feel my heart beating, but other than that, no, sort of fine. Okay, so you can feel your heart beating a bit faster, do you think, than normal? Is that? I don't know, I can just sort of feel it more. But I've also, I've been feeling a bit tired at work, haven't really been like exercising has been a bit difficult because I've been feeling tired and yeah performing daily activities has been a bit harder than usual okay all right and how long has that been for the tiredness and not wanted to exercise only after only for a couple of weeks or so couple of weeks okay and then and the last day or so that when you get the cough and the pain in the side and you coughed up blood Okay alright You said you felt a bit warm Have you measured your temperature at all With the back of my hand yes It just feels hot with that, okay, all right. Okay, and now can I just ask, do you smoke at all? No. What do you work as? I work in an office, just a desk job. Okay, all right. And do you live alone? Yes. In a flat or a house? Flat. Do you have any pets? Cat. A cat, okay. Are you on any medication at all, regular medication? Yeah, methotrexate. Methotrexate, okay. What are you on that for? I've got SLE. SLE, okay. Do you have any other diagnoses, any other illnesses at all? No. No. Right, okay. And do you have any allergies to any medication? No. Any other allergies at all? No. Okay. So you're taking methotrexate at the moment. When was the last time you had methotrexate? This morning. Oh, you had it this morning. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. A couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and get an idea of how unwell you are, okay? The first thing I'd like to do is to try and measure your pulse. So the way we're going to do this is that if I can get you to try and locate the pulse in your wrist. Not everyone can do this, so don't worry if you can't. But if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse, it's just under the thumb. If you put your fingers up and down like that, you might be able to feel the pulse. I've got it. You've got it, okay. Are you sure? Yeah. All right. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting okay so I'll just get my stopwatch up okay so if you can you've still got the pulse yeah okay so if you can start counting now please if you can stop now I think that was about 11 or 12 so that would make your heart rate about 66 to 74 that that okay good fantastic and the next thing I like you to try and do okay it depends on the lighting so it may not be possible but looks I'd like to try and do is just to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger and then let me see how quickly the redness comes back okay so if you can see what I'm doing now my fingers come right behind the screen I'm squeezing it okay just what we first is So just watch me first. I'm squeezing it, and then you can see that it goes pale, and then it goes back to the normal red color. So if I can get you just to put your finger up to your camera, and then with the other hand, just try and squeeze it. You've got very good circulation. OK, perfect. That's great. Thank you so much. The last thing I'd like to do is I'd like to try and have a look down your throat. Are you doing this consultation via a phone or a laptop? Phone. A phone. I've rested it on my laptop, so I think we're good to go. Sorry, say that again? I've got it rested on my laptop. Okay, fine. Okay. So if you position your device up above your head, put your head back, mouth open wide, and let me see if I can have it. That's fantastic. Say ah. Ah. Perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent. Lovely. Okay. last thing is if I can get you to feel inside your neck just on the sides here okay by your Adam's apple tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not no I feel pretty normal today okay I think all right now sorry I've forgotten your name Doris Doris and so Doris what I think we need to do is this sounds like you might have a chest infection okay if you're coughing up blood and you're feeling your heart racing I think you need to be examined today someone to listen to your chest and maybe check your blood pressure as well check that you're stable I have to say examining you now from what limited I could do online, everything does seem to be okay in terms of you don't seem acutely unstable. However, if you've got this kind of pain when taking a deep breath in and you coughing up blood we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have pneumonia or chest infection And that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope And you may need an antibiotic There one thing I need to ask you Have you been on any long-haul flight recently? No. No. Okay. Have you ever had any clots in your legs or clots in your blood clots? Not that I know of, no. No, okay. Anyone in the family have that? No. No, okay. All right. what I think we'll do is we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today okay I would like someone to listen to your chest and to check your blood pressure and to recheck your pulse as well just make sure and check your temperature make sure all those parameters okay you may well need an antibiotic okay do you have any allergies to any antibiotics no okay I'm not I'm gonna not I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now because I you need to have that basic assessment first before we proceed to the next step but that's what I would predict the next step might be. I'm going to leave a number in the notes for this appointment for you to ring our support team and then they will book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs today and then they'll do that assessment and then we'll take it from there okay? But we don't think I'm dying of lung cancer? Given the the way in which you have presented now just one day with the fever and this slight pain concurrent with the blood and the phlegm that's not usually how lung cancer is present there's more insidious over a longer period of time with other symptoms however we might need to get some investigations to exclude that it depends on the examination finding we will see you okay all right are you worried about lung cancer well you know you start coughing up blood and you think you're going to die of lung cancer. So just remind me how old you are again? I'm sorry. 45. 45, okay. It's something we do need to be cognizant of, okay, and we may end up having to do a follow-up chest x-ray if things don't settle down. But at the moment it seems more like a chest infection rather than a lung cancer. That's good to know. Yeah, that is good to know, yes, because that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are okay because chest infections can become nasty as well. They can lead to infections inside the body. We want to avoid that as well. So let's get you checked out today and hopefully we can put your mind to rest and get you on the right course of treatment. Perfect, thank you very much. All right, you're welcome. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye.
