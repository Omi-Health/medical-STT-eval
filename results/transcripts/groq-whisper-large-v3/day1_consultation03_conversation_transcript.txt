I'm not really prone to them no no but I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago. Okay and what happened then? Just similar. How long did it last for? A couple of days. Did you do anything that made it better? Yeah I had to take painkillers and had to go to bed and rest and yeah a couple days off work and work in the fashion industry and you know they're wondering what's going on like having to take sick days yeah back to work today but you know what if it is a brain tumor what's going to happen with my future and my career you know yeah i'm really worried about this i've never had headaches like this before like why should i get now yeah sure and i can see your concerns obviously there's a lot a lot of worry there um but you know let's take it step by step um and see exactly what the causes headaches are first. I'm just going to ask you some very yes no questions that's okay have you noticed any problems with your speech at all any difficulty with your words? no any problems with your arms and legs for example numbness or weakness? no any difficulty with balance your balance or coordination? no okay and have you had any injuries to your head have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head no okay all right and you feeling otherwise okay so for example your breathing is okay you not feeling breathless or no okay. Do you have any other medical history I should be aware of? No. So for example have you had anyone told you've had migraines in the past? No. No. Okay. My mum has migraines but I've not been diagnosed. Right, so my next question was about family history. Is there anything in the family, so apart from migraines, is there anything else, anything related to the brain for example? Thyroid as well. What was that sorry? My mum has an underactive thyroid as well. Underactive thyroid as well, okay. Any other problems for example the brain or you mentioned brain cancer, any other family history of that? No. Okay, in terms of medications do you take anything on a regular basis? I take the pill, Microgynon. Okay and how long have you been on that for? Three months. Three months, okay and is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else? It's for contraception. Okay, alright. That's something we may need to have a little discussion that today as well. My next question was about your social really your situation at home you mentioned you work in a fashion industry is your work is your job quite stressful at the moment? Yeah it's really stressful actually having problems with people at work you know managers like putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver and yeah it's not a good time. Is it getting you down? I don't feel down just feel a bit stressed. Okay, alright. And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally? Nothing really. Okay, do you do much in the way of exercise? No. Okay. Who's at home with you? I live on my own. Okay. Are you coping okay at the moment? Fine. Yeah, okay. Do you smoke at all? No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol No Okay all right so normally I like to kind of proceed to examination but based on your story I wonder whether you may have a migraine migraine type headache, it sounds very classical of that nature, the headache on one side, throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to bright lights. I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious such as meningitis or indeed brain cancer. I know that was a big worry of yours initially. Thank you. Thanks so much. I was so worried that I had cancer and now you say migraine. Yeah, I guess my mum had similar symptoms to me and yeah, it doesn't make Well I hope that puts your mind at ease. Certainly this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month so I think moving forwards there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important to see exactly what's triggering these headaches but we should also try and treat your headaches today and some strong painkillers would be advisable. So you know think about paracetamol or even cocodamol and some anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen and naproxen. How does that sound to you? Okay, that sounds good. And if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we can maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place, something like prophylactic medicines. Okay. We can have a discussion next time. I'll see you next week, perhaps. Okay. Okay. Now, a couple of things I want you to think about is if your symptoms aren't getting better in the next two three days or indeed they're getting worse I'd like you to come back and see me straight away if possible so if your headache's getting worse and not responding to medications or your neck pain is getting worse or you're developing any weakness in your arms and legs or your vision then I want you to come back and see me straight away okay okay does that sound all okay doctor that's great great any questions for me no thank you okay have a good day thanks bye
