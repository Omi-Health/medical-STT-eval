Hi. Hello. Hi. Hi, I'm Maria. Hello, I'm Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. How are you doing? I'm all right, thank you. I feel a little weird today, to be honest. Yeah, so just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your full name for me, please? Yes, Maria Okay and your date of birth? That is the 1st of October 99. Okay and your email address for me please? Yes mtrava at gmail.com. Okay and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we have a confidential conversation yes I think I am yeah good right you've mentioned in your in your patient notes that you're having some sort of lip swelling and you after you had a sandwich is that correct yeah that is well I don't think I don't think it was it wasn't a sandwich but it was it was something with prawns. So basically I sometimes go with my friends to this place called Fat Park and we regularly have like usually I have like a normal vegetarian soup or something and yeah and then I wanted to try something new. So what happened was I ordered a prawn soup. It's called a laksa, it's like soup, I ordered a prawn one this time. Yeah. And then my feel started, like my lips started feeling a little weird, just in the corner sort of on the left first And then I don know and then we went back we had a little bit of a chat a banter I wasn really paying attention Now I feel that there is a swelling there is like a swelling on my upper lip and it kind of getting bigger I don know what to do Right, so when did you have the prawn soup? What time? That was, that must have been just after work, so maybe like around seven. Okay around seven o'clock and how long did it take to develop the swelling? Well I wasn't really paying attention so it must have been like must have been like and a half an hour maybe. Okay in half an hour you developed the swelling yeah? Yeah. Okay and it's getting bigger and bigger? Yeah you still feel it like really pumping blood and it's kind of getting bigger it feels like it's getting worse okay so just a few more questions um so you mentioned about your swelling of your lips is there any feeling of swelling in in your throat like your throat is closing up any feeling like that yeah actually i i feel like i can't breathe that well right now okay and do you feel like like your chest is tight I don't know if it's the chest, it just generally feels a little difficult. Okay. Yeah, it might be, I'm not sure. Okay, right. And just a few, have you ever had these, any kind of lip swelling in the past, after eating any food? Yeah, well, maybe. I remember like a year ago, a year ago I was out with my friends and I think we went like to a late night kind of Chinese place and I remember that I was quite drunk to be honest and I remember that after like having that very late I woke up the next morning quite swollen up and had also like okay felt really bad and quite difficult breathing but I don't know what it was I had it was like a curry or something okay and what did you take at that time did you use anything like antihistamine or anything when you had that last time well i generally have asthma so i tell i i take oh what's it called salbutamol inhalers yeah yeah so i do take that regularly but i've always taken it i generally have asked and any other inhalers is it just the salbutamol that you use any other brown inhalers? Oh no I don't think so no okay right and um so do you use anti-stamines like cetrazine, loratidine, peritone any of those kind of things? No but oh I think sometimes I don't know which ones so I have a peanut aloe as well yeah like I've always had it. Yeah. I think I do get antihistamines for that, but I'm not sure which ones. And any point, because you had peanut allergy, any time you had to ever use like an injection? When I was a kid, I think I remember my mom told me about it, but I don't know what it was because I was small, and I changed doctors since. Right. Has your mom ever said that you had to go to hospital because you had a severe allergic reaction? Yeah, when I was like six or something, I think, oh sorry, the swelling is getting... Oh, yeah, I think when I was six... Are you okay now? I feel a little dizzy right now, to be honest. You feel dizzy Okay right Do you have any kind of antihistamines with you at the moment No I don think I have Right, okay. Right, all right. I'm really a bit worried about you at the moment, Maria. I think we need to call an ambulance because from what history you've been telling me, it sounds like you could be going into what we say an anaphylactic reaction that's when your throat and your chest you know closes in and you might need an injection like what your mom's you know what your mom told you as you were a young child okay right so is there any anyone with you at the moment or are you alone I'm alone at the moment so hang on the line while I'll call the ambulance okay and I'll send them right to you okay and okay somebody just came so just call the ambulance make sure that person's with you till the ambulance comes yeah because we are worried about an anaphylactic reaction so you need to go straight away could you ask the person whether they have any antihistamines around in the interim while we're waiting yes uh mom mom do we have any antihistamines around yes yes oh yeah we do that straight away and if mom can call mom if you can call the uh nine nine nine nine nine yeah and say that your there is a suspected anaphylactic reaction and they need to come straight away okay yes she said she will yes right so straight away take the antihistamines in the meantime all right okay okay yes thank you come up from the hospital do give us a ring back we might need to sort you out um with your injections and things like that okay yes yes i'll do yes thank you okay then take care thank you very much
