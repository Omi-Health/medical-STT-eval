Hello. Oh, hello. Hi. Hi, how are you doing? My name is Joe. I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I have your name, please? Yeah, sure. I'm Daniel. Hi, Daniel. And your date of birth? Yeah, May 1992. 1992. Okay, Daniel. And are you in a comfortable and confidential place to talk? Yeah, totally. Happy to go ahead. Great. How can I help? Yeah, I just, my chest has been feeling really tight. Okay, and how long has this been going for Daniel? For about three hours now. Okay, and so tight chest, three hours, and so you were born in 92, so it makes you 26. 26, yeah. And you are, any shortness of breath at all? Yeah, like a little bit. Yeah, a little bit short of breath. Not too bad. Any cough, wheeze? Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well. I'm coughing, yeah. Slight cough, yeah. Sore throat, runny nose, sore ears. You know, I had a cold last week, and it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose, just feeling under the weather. You feeling better now, on the tight chest? I mean, I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore. Right, okay, okay, but now you've got this, so you've still got symptoms of a cold, essentially. Yeah, the cough's kind of stuck around. Ah, yeah, okay. Are you coughing up anything? No. and do you have any other medical problems like asthma yeah yeah I have asthma I've had it for a while now and then I have like a hay fever you know some allergies dust okay you have any inhalers or any medications um yeah so you know the Ventolin it's called a salbutamol yeah I got that one and then I have a steroid clenil clenil inhaler yeah okay yeah and have you been using clenil and the Ventolin and how often you been using them well to be honest I was away at uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me so I haven't really in the past week both because it because I'm sorry they ran out tonight I forgot to go and grab the next one yeah sure better we go all All right, so you haven't got any Clenil or any Ventolin at the moment? Not with me right now, no, I ran out. Okay, all right. And any drug allergies that you know of? No, no, not allergic to anything. Just the dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs. Okay, great. Now, do anyone in your family have any medical problems you know of? Yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Oh, when I was young, I also had eczema and I had a milk protein allergy when I was young, too. Okay. So just do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or hopes for this consultation? um not really like i feel like asthma's probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers wouldn't be helpful um it's just kind of scary because i haven't had a time like this where i've been so tight uh in a long time yeah absolutely i can i can imagine um well it Certainly sounds like you've had this cold you've got wheezy with a cough And it's non-productive cough and you're short off Is the cough worse at nighttime? I? Mean it gets a little bit worse tonight, but basically just pretty consistent. Yeah, I've gone away And you've got this tight tight chest, but you even say you've got chest pain there's more tight chest Is that no not really pain? It's more like tight it just feels like sometimes I can't get a full breath in you know yeah sure um okay well I would quite like to certainly get you some Ventolin, Clenomodulate. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past Not in a long time when I was young a little bit more like back in high school but I been pretty good at taking my inhalers so not so much anymore Have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient as in you know stayed in there overnight for asthma Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat. Oh, okay. So you went to hospital and had a... So you stayed in hospital for a few days, did you, with an asthma exacerbation? Yeah, I did, yeah. Okay, but currently you're just on Ventolin and Clenol and you haven't got any of those inhalers at the moment? I've been pretty good, just on the Clenol and the Salbutamol. Sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation? I think I was like 17, 16 maybe. Okay. Just to quantify how short of breath you are, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you? No, you won't have, will you? Yeah. Are you able to walk up a flight of stairs okay, walk on the flat okay, without getting too short of breath? Or are you short of breath at rest? I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, except for that feeling I was describing. it does when I'm walking upstairs I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be sure yeah okay but you're not sure of breath at rest at the moment no no no I'm not okay fine so what I think and just to go over is there anything you'd hoped about getting other than the prescription for your inhalers was there anything else you'd hoped about getting I just want to know that I'm okay I just don't want to have to get that that intubation again. Sure, yeah. Absolutely. Well, I'm really glad you've talked to me today. I think what we can do is give you a prescription for some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within the hour, I would hope. And I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So these are tablets which you can take for five days, two tablets in the morning, and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response. Okay? Okay. Now there are some side effects to the steroids, which I should really tell you about, but please read the label that's associated with it. Don't be too worried about the side effects. They're uncommon, most of the time, the steroids are very well tolerated. And you probably have you had them in the past Do you know of Sorry sorry you were cutting in and out a little bit there what are you saying have you had steroids in the past um I can remember probably probably yeah so they they can come they can make you your mood change can be slightly low or too slightly high can give you a high blood sugar and that okay they can also cause rash nausea headaches but mostly is well tolerated and it should help you out an awful lot what I like to do is send you these the some prescriptions for your inhalers are ongoing so you can once you get better from this asthma attack you can you can use the clinical modulate in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN, so a Ventolin when you need to, when you're getting dizzy. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than every three hours at any time, it's a good idea to seek medical attention, so see a doctor in some capacity. And the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better have you do you know what space yours have you used one before yeah yeah I somebody taught me how to use it on a while ago I don't I don't really use it to be honest but have you got one I think I do I have one somewhere okay alright well I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it but essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside breathing in and out for five or ten breaths. Okay. Yeah. So was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage? I think you got me covered. Okay. And I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better if you're okay all right all righty I think no worries any deterioration your symptoms like worsening shortness of breath and we're just generally concerning symptoms pain in your chest tightness feeling lightheaded then seek further medical attention and it's okay all right sounds Good. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
