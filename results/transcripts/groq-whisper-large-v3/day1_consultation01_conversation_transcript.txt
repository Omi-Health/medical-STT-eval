Hello. Hello, how are you? Hi. Shall we stop? Yeah, okay. Hello, good morning sir, how can I help you this morning? Hi, I've just had some diarrhea for the last three days and it's been affecting me. I need to stay close to the toilet and yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. And when you say diarrhea, what do you mean by diarrhea? Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often or are your stools more loose? Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stool, going to the toilet quite often, and like some pain in my lower stomach. Okay. And how many times a day are you going, let's say, over the last couple of days? Probably like six, seven times a day. Six, seven times a day. And you mentioned it's mainly watery. Have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools? No, no blood, yeah just watery and loose stool. Okay and you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well? Yeah. Whereabouts is the pain exactly? So in my lower abdomen so like yeah just to one side. One side, what side is that? On the left side. Yeah sorry okay and can you describe the pain to me? Yeah it feels like a cramp, like a muscular cramp and yeah I feel a bit weak and shaky. Okay and does the pain, is it there all the time or does it come and go? It comes and goes. Does the pain move anywhere else for example towards your back? No just mainly in my stomach. Okay fine and you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well, what do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been having, have you been feeling feverish for example Yeah it doesn feel like yeah I just mainly feel weak I haven had a fever at the moment but I did notice a temperature when the symptoms started So yeah around about three or four days ago Did you measure your temperature then? Yeah, I didn't measure my temperature, no, but I felt just a bit hot. OK. Any other symptoms like sweating or night? No. And any vomiting at all? Yeah, so I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now I've stopped vomiting. You stopped vomiting, okay. And was your vomit, I know it's not nice to talk about, but was it just normal food colour? Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. And there was no blood in your vomit, is that right? No blood, no. No, okay. And any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhoea, you mentioned your vomiting. Yeah. Anything else that comes to mind? I had a loss of appetite, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids. Okay, so you're drinking fluids. What kind of foods have you managed to eat? Just soups and light foods like smoothies and liquid foods mainly. Okay, fine. So you started three days ago to get symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused your symptoms to kick on? So for example, things like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people with similar symptoms? Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago. But other than that, I've been eating normally. I think unusual, yeah. Do you remember what you ate? Yeah, I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Okay. Anyone else unwell with similar symptoms? So no one else in the family so I have a wife and two kids and one child was vomiting but they haven got diarrhea There no one with the same symptoms Okay, okay, fine. Right, and in terms of your overall health, are you normally fitting well? Yeah, I mean, other than asthma, I use an inhaler, everything else is fine. Okay, and is your asthma well controlled? Yeah, that's fine. I just use an inhaler and that's under control. And you don't have any other tummy problems, bowel problems I should be aware of? No. No, okay. Apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications? No, no other medications. Okay, fine. In terms of just your day-to-day life, you said it's been affecting your life. Yeah. In what way has it been affecting your life? So I need to stay close to the toilet because I go quite frequently during these past three days. Okay. Yeah, other than that, it's the main concern. And are you currently working at the moment? Yes, yeah, I work. Where do you work? I'm an accountant. Okay. Have you been going to work the last three days or have you been at home? Yeah, I've been going to work. Okay. That must be difficult for you then. Yeah, it's been quite difficult. And you say you mentioned you live with a wife and two children, is that right? Yes, yeah. All right. Just a couple of other questions we need to ask. Do you smoke at all? No, I don't smoke. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No, I don't drink alcohol, no. Okay. So normally at this stage I like to examine you if that's okay, but having listened to your I think just to recap, for the last three days, you've been having loose stool, diarrhea, a bit of tummy pain mainly in the left side vomiting and being generally quite weak and lethargic You mentioned you having this Chinese takeaway as well three days ago and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems It seems like you may have something called gastroenteritis which is essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your tummy, mainly caused by viruses but it can be a possibility of bacteria causing your symptoms. At this stage what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management so I don't think you need anything like antibiotics it's really just making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids. There are things like Dirolite you can get from the pharmacy which it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. And if you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would recommend that in the first couple of days. Yeah. If you are feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. I would certainly advise you to take some time off work, actually. I know you're quite keen to work. I would say the next two to three days, as the infection clears from your system, take some time off and rest. if your symptoms haven't got better you know in three to four days I'd like to come back and see you again okay because if it is ongoing then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing symptoms yeah and we may need to do further tests like taking a sample of your stool so we can test that etc etc yeah sure yeah how's that sound that sounds great yeah yeah do you any questions for me? No, no further questions. Okay, is the treatment plan clear? Yeah, that's very clear, thank you. Great, well I wish you all the best. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Bye.
