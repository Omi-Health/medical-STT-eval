Hello. Hello. Just before we go any further, can I confirm your name and age please? My name is Pfizer and I'm 26. Okay, and how can I help you this afternoon? So basically I've been really stressed at work for the past few days and I've realised that I've got really dry itchy skin. Okay, I'm sorry to hear work's been so stressful. Tell me more about your skin firstly, you mentioned it's been dry and itchy, whereabouts on your skin? All over my arms and my hands mainly. Okay and is this something you've had before? No, never had that. So did it come about quite suddenly or was it more kind of a gradual thing? I think I started a few days ago. Okay. And has it spread anywhere else? Has it spread to your chest, your legs, your face? No. Okay. So apart from being dry and itchy, any other symptoms? Has it been sore? Have you noticed any cracked skin? So my skin is quite red and I'm using coconut butter for the past few days. Okay. I don't have any spots. Okay. No fevers and I'm not sweating either. Thank you for mentioning all those. Okay, so the coconut butter hasn't helped with the itch? No, it hasn't. Okay. And you mentioned work's been quite stressful. What do you do for work? I work as a teacher. Okay And in what way has work been stressful I think the kids have been really annoying these days Okay Well, I've been really annoyed. Okay. All right, well, I'm sorry to hear that, and I hope it gets better. Going back to your skin, is there anything you've done perhaps which may have triggered your symptoms, anything you've touched, or, for example, shower gel, soaps, fabric cleaners? I went swimming a few days ago. Okay, is that the first time in your life or have you been before? No, I've been before. Okay, and did your symptoms start after you went swimming? Yes, they did. Okay, alright. You mentioned you've had no other fevers, is that right? No fevers, no vomiting? No. No, how's your health otherwise? It's pretty good, yeah, I'm not on any medication. We'll get to medication in just a second. Do you feel genuinely run down? Do you feel tired? Yeah, I think I have been quite tired. Okay, okay. Are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, I've been drinking and eating as normal. Your appetite's fine, is it? Okay, and your bowels, are your bowels working okay? Yeah. No problems with vomiting or loose stools? No. Okay and your water works are all okay, your pasta and urine okay? Yep. Okay all right, so just moving on in terms of your other medical history is anything else I should be aware of? I'm currently taking Microgyn. Microgyn? Yeah. Okay do you know what that is? No. Okay it's a contraceptive pill. Does that make sense Does that ring a bell now Oh yes Okay Is it any other medications that you take Oh no No So in terms of your medical history there no problems of skin problems in the past, things like eczema or dermatitis? No, I think it might just be the weather. Sorry, what was that? You think it's... I think it might just be the weather. the weather yeah oh you think okay you think the weather okay no it's okay no problems we'll um uh move and do you suffer from allergies are you someone who suffers from allergies um allergies medication allergies i think um i'm lactose intolerant that is intolerant okay that could be helpful to know um fine in terms of family history is Is there anything in the family that you're aware of? Yeah, so my dad has asthma and my mum has hay fever. Hay fever? Yep. Okay. Fine. Again, any skin problems that you're aware of? No. No, okay. All right. Socially, who do you live with at home? Just me. Live alone? Yep. And do you smoke at all? Can I ask, do you smoke? Are you a smoker? No, I don't smoke. Do you drink much and wear alcohol? No. Recreational drugs? No. And you said you work as a primary school teacher? Yes, that's right. The reason I ask is sometimes stress can be a contributing factor. You felt, you noticed yourself, life's been more stressful recently. All right. Do you think that might have any correlation to your symptoms? I don think so Okay all right Fine Okay well normally at this stage I like to proceed examination but based on your story, it's difficult. I think, you know, essentially the story is you've got a dry, itchy rash on your, mainly your hands you mentioned, and your arms, which started perhaps after swimming a few days ago but no other symptoms you're feeling otherwise well no fevers no bleeding or discharge from skin I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis have you heard of that condition before I have yes okay great well I can give you a patient information leave know about that which gives me more information about the disease but it's something that we can readily treat it with a couple of you have steroid creams I can give you which will help with inflammation and something called emollients which will help with the dry dry skin and that's something you just need to kind of paste on onto your skin throughout the day for the next few days and hopefully that helps your symptoms okay oh thank you very much you can also try antihistamines so you can get things over the counter, piratin, loratadine, that can almost help with the itchiness. Yeah, that sounds good. Okay, and that's probably what I recommend. Paracetamol on this occasion wouldn't be helpful. Painkillers wouldn't be helpful on this occasion. But let's see how the next few days go. And if it's still not getting better, come back and see me next week and we can have another look again at your symptoms. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Do you have any questions for me? No. Okay, well I wish you all the best, have a good day. Thank you very much.
