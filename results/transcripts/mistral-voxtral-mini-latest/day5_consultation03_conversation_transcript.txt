Hi there, I'm Dr Smith from Babylon. Hi. Hi there, can you just confirm your name, date of birth and the first line of your address first of all please? My name is Valerie Paul. My date of birth is the 19th of September 1993. My address is 64 Cliveden Place in South Wimbledon. Okay, are you in a private place where you can have a confidential consultation today? Yes, I am, yeah. What can I do for you? I've been feeling really anxious over the past few months. I just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house and it started to really worry me and just add up and build up that anxiety and I just didn't know who to talk to so I wanted to check with my GP. Okay. Do you mind just telling me a bit more about when it started? Do you think there's something which changed in your life at that time? I guess so. I think I would say maybe about two months or so I've been feeling like this and that probably coincides with me starting a new job, which I would say it's quite stressful. I mean, every job is stressful when you first start, but it's been really stressful, I think, over the past two months. Definitely. What's your job? So I work for a fashion retailer in the head office team and it's just a brand new sector. I've never worked in retail before. My boss is not very nice to me. But I also think that it's just been, I just really dread going there. I just hate speaking to her, I hate seeing everyone and really worried about whether I'm doing well or not. And it's really impacting on the rest of my life, like my sleep and stuff like that. Okay, so just day to day, tell me from the start of your day how it affects you. You said you dread going to work. How does it affect you in terms of like your sleep at night and things like that? Yeah, so I say like I don't want to go to work in the morning so I just find no way I can't get out of bed but it's also because when I leave I just when I've left work I just feel so stressed I'm so worried about everything I've done I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours. Okay so what time do you go to bed at night time? About 10, 11. And what time do you get to sleep? Not for ages. I'm lying awake all night. Okay. And when you eventually get to sleep, do you wake up with your alarm in the morning or does something else wake you up before then? So I find my heart kind of racing and then I'm just like panicking that I'm going to be late and that that's going to make work even more stressful. So I do have an alarm, but I find myself waking up before that because I'm just my heart is racing. And actually the other day I was just like I was lying in bed and I really thought my heart was racing so much. I thought I was going to have a heart attack in the morning. Okay, and so how many hours sleep do you think you get a night? I just, I can't even tell because I feel like I'm, even when I'm in sleep, it's such a shallow sleep, but maybe three, four hours I'm getting now. Okay, and what about your eating patterns? Any change in how you're eating or whether your diet's changed? Probably not significant changes, maybe, no I wouldn't say that I'm eating much differently. I probably have more chocolate than normal just because I feel so down. Okay, you're eating regularly otherwise? Yeah. And you told me about the palpitations, just tell me a bit more about that. Yeah, so it's usually kind of like when I realise in the morning that either I feel like I'm going to be late because I've overslept because I'm so tired, or I wake up in a panic thinking I'm going to be late. So it's just kind of like... just a constant like rapid heart beating it's really really stressful I don't know if it's stress or I did think it was like a heart problem initially. Does it feel like a regular fast beat or an irregular beat? Irregular I think. And how long do you think it lasts for when you get it? Oh, it can be anything. I think it was a couple of minutes or the day I was actually just sort of lying there for like holding my hand on my chest for like 10 minutes. Okay. Is that something that you've had before this or is it a new thing? Yeah, I would say this is only in the past sort of like couple of months as I say that I've been experiencing this. Okay, any chest pain with that? No, well yeah it's painful when my heart is being fast but yeah. And in the daytime, you said you're not getting much sleep so how's your energy level in the daytime? It's just really really low. I'm finding now that I'm just I find no enjoyment at all Kind of day to day and anything that I'm doing. It's not just my job It's you know when I leave I'm just so tired that anything that previously was really fun is just not enjoyable and I'm like Yeah, on edge the whole time. Okay, so what do you do in the evenings? Well right now I'm working so late because everything is really, really stressful so I don't really get much time for myself but when I do want to go out or see friends or just relax it seems quite difficult to do that. Okay and are you avoiding contact with friends or do you still see them? I avoid them in so much that I feel like I'm... Yeah, so I mean sometimes it just, I know that I'm not going to have fun because I don't want to go out and do things that I would normally have done. Okay, what about hobbies or exercise or anything else outside work? Do you do anything else outside work? Yeah, as I say, like everything that I've had previously been doing has been just difficult to continue with. I did used to like to go running and to play tennis and stuff, but now it's just not, I'm just not enjoying it. I'm not going out to do that quite so much. And has it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work? No, because I think that would just add to the tension. But I do pretty much every morning I think, oh, I should call in sick or like, let's not go. And what's the worst that it's got? Have you ever been so overwhelmed that you couldn't get into the office, you couldn't go into a situation? Have you ever had a panic attack? No, I wouldn't say so. I think I've always managed to make it to work, but I wonder if it's building up. So this is why I wanted to call because I'm worried it's building up to that. I don't know what to do because I've felt it get worse and worse over the past couple of months. Okay, and apart from work, are there any other situations which provoke quite extreme anxiety, like being in public places, social situations, public transport, anything like that? Yeah, I mean I find public transport really stressful anyway, especially being on the tube because it's quite getting warmer so it's just really airless. But I think the majority of it, because my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well. Okay. Before this, did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this? Not really, no, I would say, I mean everybody always has a bit of tension, a bit of anxiety, but I've never felt anything that's bad before. Okay, and what about your mood day to day? I mean I can see that you're quite distressed by it, but do you ever get really down about this? I mean, yeah, yeah, because I do, yeah, I'm pretty much down, like, I don't enjoy being in my day at all because I'm just so worried about everything. And I find that even when I'm not, like, even at the weekends and stuff, it's just the kind of like constant feeling of just being a bit down, a bit unhappy. When do you think you last felt yourself? Um, I don't know if that's a good question. I can't really put a date on that at all. And has your mood ever been so low that you felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job or with your life or with your normal things as they were going on? No, I wouldn't say that I've had, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any, thoughts that have been that extreme like I don't you know I have I have a good support system like I do have a good family and stuff so I have I don't have worries about actually wanting to um not go on it's just that I don't want to go on like this yeah okay and where do you who do you live with at home sorry Who do you live with at home? Yeah, I live with my parents, just my parents. And how much alcohol do you have in an average week, do you think? I don't know, probably quite a lot on the Friday or Saturday, just because that's kind of normal. Maybe I do have a bit during the week, my parents obviously are retired so they just drink whenever they want, so whenever they're having a glass of wine they'll offer it to me. I guess I don't really keep track of it that much. Okay, so how much would you guess? Probably quite a lot on Friday or Saturday because it's usually going out, so maybe like I probably go over my limit just on those days anyway. And then like maybe a glass of wine during the week. Okay. Do you smoke or take any other drugs or anything? I try not to smoke, but I do occasionally. But I don't take drugs. Okay. And have you done anything yourself to help? Have you talked to anyone, talked to any counsellors, done any online, looked online at all? I talked to my mum because she also suffers from, or she's suffered from like depression in the past. I didn't think that it was, that I was suffering from depression. actual depression because it just seems to be manifesting as just stress the whole time. But I did talk to my mum about it but I haven't sought any, she recommended that I come to the GP but I haven't sought any other. And would you be happy to have some one-to-one therapy? Yeah, I think so. I've never done that before. What we would suggest in the first instance is to, you can self-refer via the NHS for what we call like talking therapy, which is a type of behavioural therapy where they can really look at your situation, how you're reacting to it. the what was provoking the anxiety and what you can do to try and overcome that and So I can send you the link for that In the meantime, so it can be a bit of a wait. There are some online resources that are really helpful Put the details on there and you can get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well and if you're feeling like it's not helping at all or your anxiety is getting worse to the point where you can't cope with work or you can't just do your normal things day to day then it's important for you to give us a call back and just discuss that further. I mean some people with anxiety they do need to take medication to control that but that's not something that we've suggested in the first instance. Okay. And I'll put some more information on your notes about helping with your sleep patterns and things like that. That's great, I look forward to reading it. In terms of palpitations, it is more likely to be associated with anxiety, but it's probably worth having a couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that there's not something triggering that off, and then arranging a GP follow-up a week after you've had the test, and we can just go through the results with you. Okay, okay. So if you call the support line, you can arrange the, have the blood test done. Okay, I'll call them up. Okay. Thank you so much. All right, take care. Have a good day. Bye. Sorry, sorry, way over.
