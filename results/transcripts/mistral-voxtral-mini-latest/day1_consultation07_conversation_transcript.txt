Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me okay? Yes, yeah, I can. Okay, cheers. Great. Right, how can I help you this afternoon, sir? I am not feeling very well. I'm sorry. And I haven't been feeling well for a good few days now. And... I'm really hoping you can do something about it because it's been bugging me for a while now. Well, I will certainly try my best for you. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on? I just feel a bit run down. I've got a cough, a cold, my voice has been nagging me. It's just all, yeah, that's it. Well, let's start with your cough first. Tell me a bit more about your cough. For example, are you coughing up anything at all or is it mainly dry? Yeah, yeah, I mean mostly dry, you know, it's a wee bit, in the morning it's a bit worse, but I mean, you know, it's fairly dry. So you're not bringing up any mucky phlegm? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't like to admit that. It's not something I talk about. Yeah, it's a wee bit... Yeah, I can certainly hear you've got the sniffles, a bit of a runny nose you mentioned. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. Is that coming through loud and clear on the phone? Yeah, it's definitely... Sorry to hear that, yeah, that was definitely a problem. And any other symptoms, for example, have you had any sore throats, any ear pain? Yeah, I've had a bit of a sore throat. I mean, I'm doing a lot of watching the football as well, so I do a lot of shouting at that, but I'm not sure if that's related or not. Okay. Who do you support? Well, it's a team called Partick Thistle and they're not even in the top division of the Scottish League. They're actually in the Championship, which is the league below that, and they're bottom of the table. So I've been shouting myself a wee bit hoarse because the performance has been pretty shy, if I'm being honest with you. Well, it sounds fascinating. I wish them all the best. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you mentioned a sore throat. Have you had a chance to look in the mirror? Have you had a look at the back of your throat? I mean, I shave every day, so I'm looking at myself. It's not a pretty sight, to be honest, at the best of times, but it's been a wee bit rough the last few days, for sure. Yeah. I mean, have you noticed any kind of white spots in the back of your throat or redness? Oh right, sorry, you mean looking at it? No, I don't really like to look at it, so I haven't tried to do any of that. I understand, it's not pretty, as I say, it's not something we always recommend. But moving on, in terms of your ears, any dullness or blocked ears, pain in your ears? Yeah, a wee bit. I mean, you know, I'm 50 years old now. My hearing's, you know, it's not as good as it used to be, but, you know, I think it's all right. It's all right. Okay, okay. Fine. Moving on to your chest, how's your breathing been? So do you feel more breathless or tight in your chest? No, no, it's not. So you're breathing... No, no, no. Sorry, what was that? Your breathing is fine, is it? It's not laboured? No, it's not good. It's not good. It's not good? No, no, no. Okay, okay. So you're feeling more short of breath? Yeah. Okay, okay. Any pain in your chest at all? No, it's weird. It's just a wee bit shortness of breath, but it's not pain as such. Okay. Have you noticed yourself any temperatures or fevers, feeling hot and cold, sweaty? Yeah, that's definitely something I've noticed. In bed with a wife, I'm having to get out and get the blanket off and put it back on again. It's not pleasant. I'm keeping her up at night as well, which is a bloody nightmare, but you know how these things are. Seems very difficult at the moment. Have you measured your temperature at all? I just feel it on my forehead but I haven't used a thermometer or anything. Cool, okay. And just moving on, just very quickly, any other symptoms, any nausea, any vomiting, any tummy pain? The first day I had a wee bit of diarrhea, but that's fine now. But apart from that, no. Okay. And how's your appetite? Are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to, you know, I think what is it, you starve a cold and you feed the, I can't remember what it is, but I think my appetite's been all right, yeah, yeah. Trying to keep your words up as well, you know, I hear that's what you should do. Yeah, absolutely, I completely recommend that, so keep doing what you're doing. And just lastly, any kind of muscle pain, joint pains? Yeah, it's just been a wee, I mean, again, you know, I'm getting just a wee bit older now, so it's not something that I was thinking about, but I have noticed, like, when I'm bending down and moving about, it's just a wee bit stiffer than normal, you know, and I think that might be to do with whatever this thing is, but again, it's, you know, just getting on. Where do you feel the stiffness? It's just kind of like, you know, when you're bending elbows and knees and just a wee bit kind of stiff, you know. All over, okay. And just remind me, when did your symptoms all start? You say a few days ago? Yeah, I would say, what day is it today? It's Wednesday. Wednesday, so it would have been Saturday because I was out having dinner and then yeah, I came, yeah, yeah, yeah, it would have been that because I was out for my wife's, she was doing this wee thing, a wee bit of celebration, so we were out for that and I remember saying to her, I was like, you know what, I'm not feeling great, you know, I stuck it out with her but it would have been that Saturday, so what's that, about five? Four or five days ago? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you aware of anything that might have set your symptoms off? Is it something you've eaten or have you been travelling recently abroad or? No, I haven't been, I mean, as I said, I was out with my wife. I don't know whether it's like, you know, the restaurant we went to was like, it was like pretty good. So I wouldn't have expected them to be serving me anything dodgy or anything like that. But I don't know, you know. Okay. So not that I can see. And without prying too much, what were you celebrating? Well, my wife has just been promoted, so she's now going to be a head teacher of primary school. So just to put her out. Yeah, we're knighting the tiles for that. So it's good. Yeah, yeah. Good, excellent. So just moving on, sir, regarding what we say past medical history, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? Anything to do with your heart, lungs? I'm a wee bit on the chunky side, you know. I've got a wee bit around the midriff, the spare tyres, definitely there. And I've got the diabetes. Diabetes, right. What type of diabetes? Is it type 1 or type 2? It's type 2. Type 1? Aye, aye. Because he said, the other day I spoke to him, he was sort of saying like, you know, as a bigger guy, it's kind of like, yeah. Yeah, okay. And when I was speaking to, it was another doctor I spoke to a while ago, but when he was telling me this as well, he took my blood pressure and he said that was high, higher than it should be. You've been diagnosed with high blood pressure or was it just a one? Yeah, yeah. Okay, alright. So moving on, in terms of your medications, which medications do you take on a regular basis? I'm just going to check, let me know if I'm pronouncing this correctly because I haven't got my glasses with me. So it's Metformin. That's correct, okay. And there's another one, Lisinopril. Lisinopril, yeah. I think that's those two. I've got them written down in a wee bit of paper. No problem, no problem with that. Anything else, sir? No, just those two. I mean, a wee bit of Aspen or whatever every now and again, but not for a long time. Okay, all right. I'm just moving on swiftly, sir. Do you have any allergies at all? Not that I'm aware of, you know, I mean, what are the allergies you get? Just allergies, not medications really, I'm asking, as opposed to other things. Right, no, nothing that I'm aware of, the doctor's never said no to me, so. Okay, and just very briefly socially, sir, just wanted to be very important to ask, you said you live with your wife, anyone else at home with you? No, not kids, the kids have flown the nest, so just me and the missus. Okay, okay. Good luck. Yep, and are you working at the moment, yourself? I am, yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you do? It's a wee factory just down the road, so we just manufacture steel parts, things like that. So it's a good wee job. It keeps us, the roof over us. Haze of bills, really. Yeah, exactly. What about smoking and alcohol, sir? Do you either? I do like a wee drink. The old doctor I had, he did say I was drinking just a wee bit too much. I'm not an alky or anything, but just do a few pints every now and again. Roughly on average, how many do you drink a week? pints. Well, whatever you drink, is it pint, beer, lager, wine, spirits? Yeah, you know, maybe, maybe, what, like four, four pints on like Saturday and then, you know, Sunday as well. Maybe like nine, nine pints in a week, I would say. Okay, okay. And what about smoking, sir? Every now and again, but I'm trying to cut that down. I've got a wee, what are those wee things called? The wee vaporizers. Okay. Yeah, I got myself one of those. So I've been cutting down on the cigarettes and I just got this wee thing. It's great. It's actually amazing, by the way. I wish you all the best on your journey to quit. I highly recommend it if you can. It will certainly help your health as well. So just to summarize, I think based on your story, I'm not worried. I think what you essentially have is a bit of a viral illness, perhaps, maybe signs of a flu, which I think should settle down really on its own over time. Things you can do to help yourself, you stay rested, drink plenty of fluids. If you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular paracetamol would be beneficial. You mentioned feeling a bit short of breath. I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but what we could think about is giving you a script for antibiotics, which you can maybe use in the next 24 to 48 hours if your symptoms don't get better. Right, so if I just lie down and take it easy, if I'm still feeling a bit rubbish, then I go and I... Yeah, I'll give you a script today. Give it about 24 to 48 hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and run down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like amoxicillin, one tablet three times a day. And if you're still not better by next week, come back and see me and we can have another look. Right, okay, okay, so I just, plenty of rest, lots of water. Exactly. Hopefully that can pass. Yes, absolutely. Right, that is, that's perfect, that's just what I wanted to hear. Great, well, I'm glad I could help. Cheers. And I wish you and your football team all the best. I hope so, I hope so. It's not looking too good, but all right. Thank you. Cheers. All the best. Bye-bye.
