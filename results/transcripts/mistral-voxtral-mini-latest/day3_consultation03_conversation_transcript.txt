So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your full name for me, please? That's Peter Peterson. Okay, and your date of birth? I'm 35 years old. That's going to be difficult now. Okay, fine. And what's your email address? My email address is peter.peterson at loyal.co.uk. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. I am. That's right. Thank you very much. All right. So you've mentioned that you're not having much of an appetite and energy lately. I'm sorry to hear that. Could you tell me a bit more about it, please? That's right. started long long ago now that I've been feeling down and I didn't really have energy my wife was starting to complain as well in nightly activities and I just felt like I needed to call you guys and needed to get some some more information about what could be going on. It's just that, yeah, nothing is like feeling right. I feel out of place and it's just down. So are you telling me that your mood's low? Is that what you're trying to tell me? Yes, I feel like I'm feeling short of breath. It's like always, yeah, out of energy, I would say. Yes, definitely. So how's your mood? Would you say you're depressed? You never want to say that, do you? It's a tough one, isn't it? Because you don't want to actually say... I mean, work is okay. I have trouble at work sometimes, having headaches, feeling nauseous. But I can do my work. That's okay. Do you like your work? Again? Do you like your work? Who likes to be a lawyer? Sorry, that was me. Yes, of course, I like it. You like your work, okay. And how are things at home? All right? Are you having any kind of stress at all? It is okay. Sometimes because I'm having a loss of appetite, I'm not eating very much and I'm having complaints. Other than that, it's okay. And have you lost any weight? I have a little bit, yes. But that's over a long period now. Okay, right. So you mentioned that you've lost your appetite for a while now. So how long are we talking about? That must have started when I changed over to the new law firm, I would say months ago. Are you talking about two months, three months or six months? Three months ago, three and a half months ago. Three and a half months ago. But you said your weight loss is much... Longer than that? Yeah, it started a little bit earlier than that. Sorry, I couldn't hear you. What did you say? Your weight loss, how long? It started a little bit earlier than that. I'm not sure though how it is connected. Roughly six months, would you say? Something like that, yeah. Six months. And roughly how much have you lost? Just approximately. Oh, gosh. I would say less than a stone, something like that. So about a stone, yeah? Six months. Okay, six kilos. Okay. Right, okay, so just a few more questions. It might seem a bit awkward, but it's quite relevant. Okay, so how are your bowels? Are they okay? I feel nauseous every now and again. It's coming up, yeah, just every now and again, not feeling very good, trying to... eat something but don't really want to. Yeah. Your bowels, how's your toilet? That's okay, I would say. I don't really have problems when going to the toilet. It's just been less. So you're not going to the toilet? Yes, yes. You are going. Like to be very more specific, you don't have any diarrhea? No, no diarrhea, no... Okay, so there's no blood in the poo, no mucus, nothing of that sort? No, no. Just the no. You mentioned nausea, have you been ever sick with it? No, actually not. I'm feeling unwell in the bowel region. Just the nausea. Okay. Is there any particular foods that make you nauseous? No, nothing. Okay, so you can't think of any meal. Do you suffer from acid reflux? I do not, no. Okay, okay. You also mentioned that you're feeling short of breath. So just- Yes, I'm fine. Yeah, is there any cough? No, not really, just shortness of breath. Okay. It's like when I go into the lift, it happens to be that my heart starts beating and I can't really breathe. Yeah. Is it like in closed spaces? No, it happens every time. It happens very significantly in the lift or when I'm there. So how far can you walk when you start feeling short of breath? So how far can you walk with no shortness of breath? Walk or run? Walk. We'll start with walk. Do you feel short of breath? Let's start this way. Do you feel short of breath when you walk at all? No, actually no. Right. So you can walk about a mile and you don't feel short of breath at all? That's right, yes. Okay, so just explain a bit more, just to make myself clear about the lift thing. So you said you're short of breath when you're in the lift? Yeah, my heart starts beating, I feel like I can't breathe and it's very difficult to, yeah, to explain. It's going... Yeah, just that you know when you just feel unwell and yeah your heart starts beating. You're describing like palpitations to me, yeah? So that's what you're, you're feeling your own heartbeat. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Do you get any chest pains with it? Not really, no. It's just the way it feels. Yeah. Okay, no chest pains. No chest pains. Okay, all right. Fine. So what we need to do, just before that, just a few more things. Any past medical history you'd like to share with me today? Yes, I had too little activity of my thyroid. Sorry, you had thyroid problems? Thyroid, too little activity, yes. Oh yeah, underactive thyroid, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And in... In so of that, I took thyroxine. Yeah, you're taking thyroxine. Are you using it every day? Not anymore. Why is that? I have not been taking it in the last, actually since I changed law firm, I would say. Okay, so is that, so all these things are since you've stopped taking the thyroxine? Oh. It might be coinciding, I'm not sure about that. When was your last blood test? Haven't taken one in a long time. Okay, so you've not had a blood test. Right, okay. It could, you know, generally for, you know, for underactive thyroids, what symptoms you've said, it's the opposite that usually happens, yeah? It's for underactive thyroid, like you can feel a bit like the racing of your heartbeat and all, so I'm not quite clear of what picture we are having here, yeah? I think a general set of bloods is a good idea, good start. So what we look at, because you're not having the um, aren't you? You're just feeling a bit low and things like that, right? Yes. And weak and things like that. So we'll just do a general set of bloods. We look at things like anemia, how your kidney functions are, your livers, all that with vitamin levels and your... Okay? Now, after we get those set of bloods, we will find out if we can find anything in them. If that's all clear, then we would need to do a physical examination. Okay? Okay. We would need to go in and do the thing. But there's nothing from what you history you said that we urgently were into physical examination at this point in time. I think it's a good idea to start off with the blood test and then take it from there. obviously with palpitations or chest pain if you get that's more of a medical emergency you need to go to A&E for that okay if things change you've mentioned now your bowels are fine and you're being sick so if that's the case it's okay but if your you know bowels change or you're being sick again you need to get in touch with us okay okay I haven't been walking lately at all. Sorry, could you repeat that? Yes, I haven't been walking lately at all. So it's like really hard for me to identify when I feel the shortness of breath. I just wanted to add that into, because I haven't been walking, I haven't been feeling good enough or good at all. So let's do all the blood tests first and we'll take it from there. Okay, but you know, if you have any chest pain or change in bowel habits, do get in touch with us. I will. Now what we need to do is now you need to ring up support and I'll do the form for you. But in the interim, you need to call support so that we can organize that blood test for you. And when you get the result, you will receive a text message through your phone to tell you to book an appointment. Okay. If you're feeling poorly, don't wait for that. Just get in touch with us again. Yeah? I will. How do I call support? Oh, there's a number on your app. Yeah? If you open up your app, there's the number on that. It's an 0300 number. Yeah? So just call that number. I will find it. Thank you. All right, then. You take care. Bye now. Thank you. Ciao. Ciao. Bye.
