Hello? Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me okay? I can hear you, but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Is that okay? Am I meant to just have a connection on the screen? It's audio. No, no, it's actually fine. Okay. Now, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? So my name is Dan Chowdhury, I am 27. 27, okay. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan? So I've just been having some troubles. Basically, I guess it's been a little while now and I've just been... feeling not so great and it's all come from like uh it's like basically i think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out like loads of it like i go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it yeah it doesn't feel very solid it's so just it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's uh Yeah, it's just not being very pleasant and it just kind of doesn't feel like it's getting better. Wow, sorry to hear that. It seems like there's a lot going on there. When did it all start, your symptoms? So I think it was a few, when I think about it, So Monday, Tuesday, I think it was about three, it's been about three days now. Okay. And is it mainly diarrhea? So you mentioned watery stools. How many times are you going a day, would you say? So I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Okay. Right, well, okay, so you're losing a lot of fluid there. Yeah, so, I mean, I'm trying to drink a lot of water, but, yeah, it's just quite a lot, and it's, yeah, I think I feel like it's just fluids coming out. Okay, have you got any blood in your stools? Um... So, no, I don't remember anything like, no, I think it's just nothing like that. There's nothing like that. And any tummy pain? Any pain in your tummy? Yeah, I mean, I feel a cramp and then I know it's time to go, right? So around every hour I just... feel something come up and then I have to go. So yeah, I mean, that's the kind of first sign. Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? It's kind of, if I think about it, it's like at the bottom. I don't know if that makes sense. Why don't we start with, is it in the middle or is it to one particular side? I think it feels pretty like in the middle to me, not on any side, left to right. Okay, and does this pain come and go or is it there constantly? It comes and goes, it comes and goes. Fine, okay. And if I was to ask on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever had, how bad is this pain? Okay, so like... So what do you mean by pain? So I think it's maybe a... Is this pain that's making you double over? Is a 10 out of 10 the worst pain you've ever had? Or is it more of a kind of a mild pain, like a 3 out of 10? I guess so. When I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it, so I can still sit down and... I can still like cover it up and people don't really notice. I don't know what that means, but maybe is that like a six or seven? It's always six, I think. Okay. All right, good. Apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Yeah, I definitely feel kind of nauseous. Like, I have vomited. I think it's maybe something to do with, like, whenever I have, like, milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit. And actually, yeah, one time I just, like, had some milk and I just completely vomited it. Not easy. Okay. All right. I've been trying to avoid it, but yeah. The vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea, is that right? Sorry, could you repeat that? The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhea, is that right? No, no, it's not. Okay, okay, all right. Any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? So, yeah, I think I am pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that, but it's, yeah, I'm not like not a normal temperature. Okay, so you're feeling hot, okay. And in terms of your waterworks, are you passing urine okay? Yeah, but I guess less frequently maybe, but yeah, it seems to be okay. Okay, all right. Fine. And you mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you, for example, gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else with diarrhea, for example? So my brother has actually had something like this for, he has it as well for five days as well. And I'm not, yeah, I can't think of what... what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally can deal, deals with this stuff a lot better than me, but yeah, that's why. Is your brother now better? Um, he, so he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not, I'm not really sure. He said, he said he had, he's had something for a little while as well. Okay, alright. Are you having anything to eat or drink? I can see you're drinking your coffee, but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? So it just feels like the fluids do go down, but it just feels like it's going straight through. It just feels like it's going straight through. Okay, alright, fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat, which you kept in? So I had some, I mean I had some lunch today, but again it just came out pretty loose. Okay, alright. And Dan, moving forward, are you otherwise fitting well or do you have any other medical history? So I think otherwise I'm fitting well. I'm an okay weight and I can't think of any related medical history. I mean like my... Yeah, no, I don't think so. Well, thank you. You don't take any regular medications then? So I, um, No, I mean, I've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately, but I haven't been, I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications? So I don't have any allergies that I know of. Okay. What about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? Bowel, so with bowel, like, is the colon like something? Yeah, so what I mean by bowel is the whole gut really, anything from the mouth to the penis. So, yeah, my dad actually has colon cancer at the moment. Oh dear, I'm very sorry to hear that. How is he? So, from what I heard, he's kind of... So I don't speak to him that often, so I don't know the exact details, and I don't exactly know the full things of, like, the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing, but he's sort of in his third stage. I'm not sure what that means exactly. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so... Yeah, I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting him a lot. And that's why I guess he's had it for a little while now. Well, I'm really sorry to hear that. I'll make a note of that because it's important to know these kind of details. And socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan? So, not my brother, he doesn't live with me. I live with my sister and my mum. And how are things at home? In what sense do you mean that? In general, day-to-day life, are you managing okay? Any particular challenges? I mean, I think, yeah, it's been tricky going to work with all of this. I dislike taking time off work. I feel like I just want to go when I can. So I try and go. I think at home, yeah, I just haven't really, I don't normally actually eat with my family. I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing. So I don't think it's affected them. And I haven't really been, I haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mum about it. Yeah, I'd just rather deal with these things. You mentioned work. What is it you do for work? So I work at an office in central London. So I work in government. Okay, so you're off to the office, okay, right. Just a couple of last final questions. Smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? So I smoke for like socially, but not like regularly. So normally if it's a Friday or something like that, I might have a cigarette or something like that. Sorry? And alcohol? So alcohol, you know, I might have a beer during the weekdays, not that many, maybe. On Fridays I have more alcohol, but yeah, I buy a lot more units. I suppose not every week, but maybe once or twice a month that, yeah, I'll go out with my friends and drink a lot. So that's, yeah. Well, thank you for sharing with me. That's very helpful to know. So, Dan, just as a conclusion, I'm... Just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis. Okay. A bit of a basic infection of your tummy. Okay. There's nothing to worry about. I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days, just like it did for your brother. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids. Okay. Should I just drink like normal water? I just feel like every time I drink, it's just coming out. The fluid is probably best, but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. So you can get things like DiroLite, which is a fluid replacement we can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth recommending that. Do I need like a prescription for that? No, you can just get that over the counter. Okay. You can try just, you know, regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so 48 hours, I want you to give me a call back because, you know, if you are getting dehydrated, then we need to do further investigations, okay? But I think let's see how you are in the next... one to two days okay and we'll catch up soon okay okay so you're saying that i should i could uh i'll try and buy this diorite what what should i do in terms of um food and that kind of thing should i just focus fluids food dissolve yeah absolutely it's a clear fluid you can use soft diet things like soup mash and then gradually build up um as much as your body can tolerate um but really let's try and keep yourself well hydrated first okay okay is it okay for me to carry on having like um paracetamol and things like that absolutely if you are having if you've got a bit of tummy pain if you're feeling feverish then i think paracetamol is very sensible okay okay try and avoid alcohol if you can uh okay i'll try yeah okay all right then Okay. Thank you for your help. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks for helping me out. Bye-bye now.
