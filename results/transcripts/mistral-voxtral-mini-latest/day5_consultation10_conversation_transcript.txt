Hi there, it's Dr Smith from Babylon. Can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address please? I can't hear you at the moment actually, could you turn it up, the volume up? That's better, thank you. Okay, sorry about that. Are you in a private place so you can have a consultation? Yes. What can I do for you today? I've been having this blinding headache for a few days and it's like really bothering me and I find it very hard to focus or like I can't even go to work. Okay and any headaches in the past before this? Not really just the on and off. I recently had one for like two days but it just went away with ibuprofen so nothing like or longer than two days. So how did this start? It just started all of a sudden. I woke up one morning with a headache and that was three days ago and I just keep having it. It doesn't really go away with ibuprofen either. I try that but it just, it gets a little bit better but it doesn't go away. Okay, and whereabouts in your head is the pain? It's kind of all over but I feel like over my right eye it's a bit stronger. Okay, any problems with your vision or any problems tolerating the light? Lights definitely make me more sensitive, like I don't really like strong lights. And yeah, vision, I think I get is shooting lights sometimes. I'm not sure how to explain it, just a bit of a weird kind of vision. Okay, and any nausea or vomiting? No, I'm feeling a bit sick but not vomiting. Any tingling or numbness or weakness anywhere? No. Any change in your smell or taste? No, no, no. And in the past, when you've had headaches, what have they been like? I would say quite normal headaches, just a bit of a pressure in between my eyes, but nothing major. Okay, and with this, has it been there all the time or is it coming and going? Kind of all the time. So when I take ibuprofen, it gets a bit better, so it's a bit... like less, it bothers me less, but then I still have it, it's still there. And what would you say the severity is? If 10 is the worst pain you've ever had and 0 is nothing, what would you say the pain is like? I guess it's mostly 8 and then it comes down to maybe a 5. Okay, and what about at night time? Are you able to fall asleep? Yeah, I'm sleeping well. Is it waking you up in the night time? No, no, no. But I can wake up with it in the morning. Okay, any worse when you change position or bend over or cough or anything like that? Sometimes when I stand up quickly I get a bit of a stabbing pain or if I turn my head I kind of feel like something is living inside. Okay and have you had any eye checks recently? Yeah I actually had one recently and nothing changed my vision. Okay, and have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears or pain over the sinuses? No. Or phlegm? No. Any nosebleeds or coughy, acne, blood or anything? No. And just recently, have you been well or have you had any general problems? Any change in your weight or... tiredness, lack of energy, anything like that? No change of weight, maybe lack of energy, but it might be because I'm just having this headache, so I find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities, but you know, when you have this constant headache. Have you been at work recently? I work from home, but I couldn't really manage to do it all the time, so sometimes I just do the day off. So you've had a headache over three days. How many days have you missed off work? So I work from home all these three days. First day I worked from home and then the second day I just took the whole day off. Today I just tried to work from home the first half of the day but I just stopped in the morning because I couldn't focus. Okay, and any other medical problems in the past? I think I only had a problem of pain when I was younger but no cause was found and that went away but that's the only thing I know. Okay, have you been abroad recently at all? No. Do you take any medications? Just the pill. Which one? And when did you start that? About a year ago. Any side effects with that? No, I don't think so. Have you noticed any increased frequency of headaches since you started that? No, because this headache is just very recent, so nothing really changes. Okay, and when you described your headaches in the past, you said they were just general. Did you have any visual symptoms, flashing lights? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
