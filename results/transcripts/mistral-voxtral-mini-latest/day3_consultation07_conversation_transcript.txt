Hello. Hi, my name is Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. How are you? I'm good. I mean, I'm so I'm bad. You're so so. Okay, right. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me, please? Albert Bouchard. And your date of birth? 17th of January 1987. And your address for me please? 60 and over steps. That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation. Yes. Okay, so you mentioned in our notes that you've got a skin problem. If you can tell me a bit more about it, please. Yes, over the past few days I've noticed my skin is sore and red. Okay, so where is it sore and red? It's all over my chest, my hands and arms, especially inside of the elbows. And the elbows, you can't catch that. On the inside of the elbows. Okay, inside of the elbows, yeah. Which is the worst area. All right, worst area. Is it very itchy? It's very itchy and dry all over my body. Itchy and dry. Okay. Have you had something like this in the past? Yes, I have had eczema in the past. Okay. Do you think this is similar to your usual eczema or is it worse? I think it's gotten worse like the past few days. Yeah, but you could be like something similar. So on your skin, is there any, you know, any of the patches, sore areas, you mentioned it's quite sore. Is it weeping? Is it like watery liquid coming from that area? Weeping? No. Nothing that you notice? Okay. Right. But some of the areas are cracked. Yeah, so you have cracks over there. Okay. And is there any scratch marks on any of the areas? Any scratch marks? I mean, it's very itchy to scratch myself, but there's no scratch marks. Okay. Is there any thickened skin? Like, you know, where the skin is very thick and darkened areas? No, no, I don't think so. Okay, right here. So you've mentioned you've got a history of eczema. So what do you do about it? How do you keep it under control? Usually I use a cream called Diprobase. In the shower I use something called Dermal. Dermal, alright. And have you been using them recently or not? Yes, yes, I use them. You use them every day? Yes, there's no change in that. I didn't change any. Okay. Have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema? I'm not sure. Yes, I do. Yes. You've used steroids. But it's not helping. Yeah, you're still using the steroids. Yeah, I tried. I tried. Which one are you using the steroids? What's the name? I'm not sure. Is it the over-the-counter? The box is not there. Okay, so is it like the over-the-counter ones? Sorry? Over-the-counter, hydrocortisone. Does that ring a bell? Yeah. So you're using the hydrocortisone, yeah? Are you using any antihistamines at all? No. No, no antihistamines. Okay. Right. Fine. Otherwise, other than the rash, you're feeling well in yourself. There's no temperature, no joint pains. Yeah? No joint pains. No, but I've tried those antihistamines and it didn't work. You've tried the antihistamines and it didn't work. Okay, which one did you try? The one over the counter. Okay, so like Cetrazine, yeah? Yeah, okay, that's fine. Right, okay, so from what you're describing, it looks like, you know, it is quite widespread, your eczema, yeah? Because you're having it all over your chest and hands and things like that. So do you have any allergies to any medication at all? No, no allergies. No allergies. Okay. And you don't, other than eczema, you don't have any other medical condition? I have asthma. And in my family, there is hypothyroidism and migraine. My mother has migraine. Mother has migraine and what was the other one? I didn't understand. Hypothyroidism. Who has hypothyroidism? My mother. Okay, so she has hypothyroidism. Okay, that's fine. Right, you mentioned you have asthma. So what medications are you using for asthma? um uh you know probably in later the blue inhaler so you don't you don't use it every day so you just use it on and off yeah yeah yeah blue inhalers but your breathing is all okay yeah okay yeah yeah it's only when i have a flare sure So what we need to do is obviously you've got extensive, as I've mentioned, so extensive eczema. What we'll do is you need a couple of things because to keep you a bit comfortable, you would probably need some antihistamines, which I'm going to prescribe. Also, hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you use for young children. You might probably need a bit more stronger one like Betna weight or something like that. Okay, so we'll try that first. So I'm going to give it's called the antihistamine It's called fexfenadine and then we will try with some betna weight first So it's like very small amount like it's like one fingertip Yeah, this much is is enough to cover your palms and your back of your hands yeah so it's very small amount so that if you can imagine you can cover with very small amount the whole body yeah so use that you have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks okay okay if if there's no improvement you need to get back to us or if you have any kind of adverse reaction like an allergic reaction which is unlikely but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us okay okay so what we're going to do is we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy it looks like boots on the systems is that correct yeah yes yes so i'll send it across to boots and it will be there for collect collecting if things are getting worse in the next two weeks call us beforehand otherwise wait for two weeks take the medication and the cream you still need to continue on your emollients like the dermal soap and as well as the diprobase yeah so you still need to use those in the interim any questions at all No, no question. Thank you very much. You take care then. Bye-bye now. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
