Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me okay? I can hear you but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Is that okay? Am I meant to just have a connection on the screen? It's audio and then it's actually fine. Now before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? So my name is Dan Chowdhury. I am 27. 27, okay. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan? So I've just been having some troubles. Basically, I guess it's been a little while now and I've just been feeling not so great and it's all come from like, it's like, basically I think it's diarrhoea and it's like just coming out, like loads of it. Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it, yeah, it doesn't feel very solid. It's so just, it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's, yeah, it's just not, not being very pleasant and like I just, it just kind of hasn't, doesn't feel like it's getting better, so. Wow, no, sorry to hear that. It sounds like there's a lot going on there. When did it all start, your symptoms? So I think it was a few, when I think about it, so Monday, Tuesday, I saw, I think it was about three, it's been about three days now. Okay. And is it mainly diarrhoea? So you mentioned watery stools. How many times are you going a day, would you say? So I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Right, so you're losing a lot of fluid there. Yeah, so I mean, I'm trying to drink a lot of water, but yeah, it's just quite a lot and it's, yeah, I think, I feel like it's just, just fluids coming out. Okay. Have you got any blood in your stools? So I, no, I don't, I don't remember anything like, no, I think it's just nothing like that. There's nothing like that. And any, any tummy pain, any, any, any pain in your tummy? Yeah, I mean, I feel, I feel a cramp and then, and then I know it's time to go, right? So around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go. So yeah, I mean, that's, that's the kind of first sign. Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? It's kind of, I say when I, if I think about it, it's like, it's like at the bottom. I don't know if that makes sense. Well, why don't we start with, is it, is it in the middle or is it to one particular side? I think it feels pretty like in the middle to me, not on any side, left or right. Okay. And is this pain come and go or is it there constantly? It comes and goes, it comes and goes. Fine. Okay. And if I was asking us to get a one to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever had, how bad is this pain? Okay. So like, so what do you mean by pain? So I think it's, is this pain that's making you double over? Is it 10 out of 10, the worst pain you've ever had? Or is it more of a kind of a mild pain, like a three out of 10? I guess so. When I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it. So I can still sit down and I can still like cover it up and people don't really notice. I don't know what that means, but maybe is that like a six or seven? Okay. All right. Apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Yeah, I definitely, I definitely feel kind of nauseous. Like, and like I have vomited. Like, I think it's maybe something to do with like, whenever I have like milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit. And actually like, yeah, one time I just like had some milk and I just completely vomited it. I've been trying to avoid it, but yeah. The vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea. Is that right? Sorry, could you repeat that? The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhea. Is that right? No, no, it's not. Okay. Okay. All right. Any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? Um, so yeah, I think I am pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that, but it's, yeah, I'm not, like not a normal temperature. Okay. So you're feeling hot. Okay. And in terms of your waterworks, are you passing urine okay? Um, yeah, but I guess less frequently maybe. Um, but yeah, it seems to be okay. Okay. All right. Um, fine. And you mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you, for example, gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else with diarrhea, for example? Um, so I know, so my, um, my brother has had, actually had something like this for, um, he has it as well for five days as well. Um, and I, I, I'm not, yeah, I can't think of what, what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally can deal, deals with this stuff a lot better than me, but yeah, I, that's why. Is your brother now better? Um, he, so he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not, I'm not really sure. He said, he said he had, he's had something for a little while as well. Okay. All right. Are you having anything to eat and drink? Have you, I can see you're drinking your coffee, but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? Um, so it just feels like, um, the, the fluids do go down, but it just feels like it's going straight through. It just feels like it's going straight through. Okay. All right. Fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat? Which kept, which, uh, which you kept in? Um, so I had some, I mean, I had some lunch today. Um, but again, it just, it just came out pretty loose. Okay. All right. Um, and, and Dan moving forwards, are you otherwise fitting well, or do you have any other medical history? Um, so I, um, yeah, I think, I think otherwise, I'm fitting well. I, um, yeah, I mean, I, I'm an okay weight and, um, I, I can't think of any related medical history. Um, I mean like my, yeah, no, I don't think so. I'll take it. You don't take any regular medications then? Um, so I, um, no, I mean, I, I've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately, but I haven't been, I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications? Um, so I don't have any allergies that I know of. Okay. What about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? Um, so with bowel, like does, is the colon like something? Yeah. So what I mean by bowel is a whole gut really, anything from the mouth to the penis. So my, yeah, my, my dad actually has, um, colon cancer at the moment. Oh dear, I'm really sorry to hear that. How is he? So, um, from what I heard, he's kind of, so I don't, I don't speak to him that often, so I don't, I don't know the exact details and I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer and all of that kind of thing. But, um, he's sort of in his third stage. I'm not sure what that means exactly. Um, so yeah, it's, it's, um, he's, yeah, you can, I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting him a lot. And, um, that's, I guess he's, um, had it for a little while now. Well, I'm really sorry to hear that. I'll make a note of that because, uh, it's important to know these kind of details. Um, and socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan? Um, so, uh, not my brother. He doesn't live with me. I'm, I live with my sister and my mum. And, uh, how are things at home? Um, in what sense do you mean that? Just in general day-to-day life, are you managing okay? Any particular challenges? I mean, uh, I think, uh, yeah, it's been, it's been tricky, um, going to work with all of this. Um, I dislike, um, taking time off work. I feel like I just want to go when I can. So I try and go. Um, I think, uh, at home, uh, yeah, I just haven't really, um, I don't normally actually, um, eat with my family. I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing. So I don't think it's affected them. And I haven't really been, I haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mum about it. Um, yeah, I just rather deal with these things. Um, so. What are you looking at? You mentioned work. What is it you do for work? Um, so I work at a, I work at, um, an office, um, in central London. Um, it's, uh, so I work in government. Government, okay. So your office, okay, right. Just a couple of last final, a couple of questions there. Smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink alcohol? Um, so I, I smoke, um, I smoke, uh, uh, for like socially, but not like regularly. Um, so normally if it's a Friday or something like that, I might, I might have a cigarette or something like that, but, um, sorry. And the alcohol. So alcohol, um, I, you know, I might have a beer during the weekdays, maybe, uh, not that many, maybe, um, on Fridays I have more, um, alcohol. Um, but yeah, uh, I love more units. Um, on it, I suppose, um, not every week, but maybe, uh, once or twice a month that, yeah, I'll go out with my friends and drink a lot. So that, that's, um, yeah. Well, thank you for sharing with me. That's very helpful to know. So, um, Dan, just as a conclusion, um, just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis. Okay. A bit of a, basically an infection of your tummy. There's nothing to worry about. I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days, just like it did for your brother. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids. Okay. Um, you can just drink like normal water. I just feel like every time I drink, it's just coming out. Um, but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. Um, so you can get things like diorite, which is, um, a fluid replacement, which you can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth recommending that. Do I need like a prescription for that? No, you can just get that over the counter. Okay. Um, you can try just, you know, regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish, but if your symptoms aren't setting down in the next couple of days, so 48 hours, I want you to give me a call back because, um, you know, if you are getting dehydrated and we need to do further investigations. Okay. But I think let's, let's see how you are the next one to two days. Okay. And, uh, we'll catch up soon. Okay. Okay. So you're saying that I should, I could, uh, I'll try and buy this diorite. What should I do in terms of, um, food and that kind of thing? Should I just go with just fluids? Food dissolving, yeah, absolutely. So clear fluids, you can use soft diet, things like soup, mash, and then gradually build up, um, as much as your body can tolerate. Um, but really let's try and keep yourself well hydrated first. Okay. Okay. Is it okay for me to carry on having like, um, paracetamol and things like that? Absolutely. If you are having, if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, I think paracetamol is very sensible. Okay. Okay. Try and avoid alcohol if you can. Uh, okay. I'll try. Yeah. Okay. All right then. Okay. Thank you for your help. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks.
