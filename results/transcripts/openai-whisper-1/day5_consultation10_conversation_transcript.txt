Hi there, it's Dr. Smith from Babylon. Can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address, please? I can't hear you at the moment, actually. Could you turn up the volume up? Yeah, that's better. Thank you. OK, sorry about that. Are you in a private place so you can have a consultation? Yes. What can I do for you today? I've been having this blinding headache for a few days and it's really bothering me and I find it very hard to focus or I can't even go to work. OK, and any headaches in the past before this? Not really, just on and off. I recently had one for like two days but it just went away with ibuprofen so nothing like for longer than two days. So how did this start? It just started all of a sudden. I woke up one morning with a headache and that was three days ago and I just keep having it. It doesn't really go away with ibuprofen either. I try that but it just, it gets a little bit better but it doesn't go away. OK, and whereabouts in your head is the pain? It's kind of all over but I feel like over my right eye it's a bit stronger. OK, any problems with your vision or any problems tolerating the light? Lights definitely make me more sensitive. I don't really like strong lights. And yeah, vision I think I get is shooting lights sometimes. I'm not sure how to explain it, just a bit of a weird kind of vision. OK, and any nausea or vomiting? No, feeling a bit sick but no vomiting. Any tingling or numbness or weakness anywhere? No. Any change in your smell or taste? No, no at all. And in the past when you've had headaches what have they been like? I would say quite normal headaches, just a bit of a pressure in between my eyes but nothing major. OK, and with this has it been there all the time or is it coming and going? Kind of all the time. So when I take ibuprofen it gets a bit better so it's a bit like less, it bothers me less but then I still have it, it's still there. And what would you say the severity is? If 10 is the worst pain you've ever had and 0 is nothing, what would you say the pain is like? I guess it's mostly 8 and then it comes down to maybe a 5. OK, and what about at night time? Are you able to fall asleep? Yeah, I'm sleeping well. Is it waking you up in the night time? No, no, no. But I can wake up with it in the morning. OK, any worse when you change position or bend over or cough or anything like that? Sometimes when I stand up quickly I get a bit of a stabbing pain or if I turn my head I kind of feel like something is moving inside. OK, and have you had any eye checks recently? Yeah, I actually had one recently and nothing changed in my vision. OK, and have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears or pain over the sinuses? No. Any cough or phlegm? No. Any nosebleeds or coughing up any blood or anything? No. And just recently have you been well or have you had any general problems? Any change in your weight or tiredness, lack of energy, anything like that? No change of weight, maybe lack of energy but it might be because I'm just having this headache so I find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities when you have this constant headache. Have you been at work recently? I work from home but couldn't really manage to do it all the time so sometimes I just do the day off. So you've had a headache over three days, how many days have you missed off work? So I work from home all these three days and first day I worked from home and then the second day I just took the whole day off and today I just tried to work from home the first half of the day but I just stopped in the morning because I couldn't focus. OK, and any other medical problems in the past? I think I only had abdominal pain when I was younger but no cause was found and that went away but that's the only thing I know of. OK, have you been abroad recently at all? No. Do you take any medications? Just the pill. Which one? Mirtadone. And when did you start that? About a year ago. Any side effects with that? No, I don't think so. Have you noticed any increased frequency of headaches since you started that? No, because this headache is just very recent, nothing really changes. OK, and when you described your headaches in the past you said they were just general, did you have any visual symptoms, flashing lights, nausea, vomiting with them? No, nothing. Have you had your blood pressure checked recently with your pill? Yeah, I had it checked in the pharmacy when I got the pill and they said it was normal. And when was that? A year ago. OK, and any allergies to anything? No. And who do you live with at home? Sorry? Who do you live with at home? Just by myself. OK, and do you smoke? No. Do you drink any alcohol regularly? Yeah. How much in a normal week do you think? Probably like three beers once a week. OK, and do you take any other drugs at all? No, apart from the Epiduropin that I take sometimes when the headache gets really bad. So, I mean, it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache and you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well? Yeah. But you haven't had a high temperature? Have you checked your temperature? No, I didn't. I don't really feel feverish or anything. OK. I mean, it could possibly be a migraine-type headache, but in fact it's still ongoing for three days. We probably should book you into an appointment to get an examination. Obviously, if it settles in the meantime, then we can cancel that, but we should do a neurological examination, look at the back of your eyes as well. OK. In terms of medication, I can prescribe you something similar to Ibuprofen, but a bit stronger, which you can take instead of Ibuprofen, and you can take paracetamol at the same time. OK. So, if you're happy to book an appointment with the support line for us to do a full examination and start the medication which I prescribed you to take it with food. You said that when you go to bed, your headache's OK, not waking you up in the night time? Yeah, it's not. But you mentioned migraine, and that reminded me that my mum suffers from, like, she has migraines. OK. Any other family history of medical problems? No, I didn't answer it, but I know that my mum, like, she has quite bad migraines. She has vomiting and everything like that. OK, that's fine. I mean, if in the meantime, before your appointment, your headache is getting unbearable, getting worse or changing, then if it's that bad, then you should go to A&E and have an examination. OK. You can call us for further advice on that. OK. When you have an examination with us, we'll check your blood pressure as well, just to make sure your pill is still appropriate for you. OK. Because if we do think it's a migraine, then you would have to change your pill if you've had these flashing lights and things like that. Is there anything in the pill that can cause it? Well, so that pill, if you were having regular migraines with flashing lights or other symptoms, it wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill, particularly. You'd have to change it to something else. All right. But you can carry on with that for the moment. OK. Have you got any other questions? So, will you, like, send me a referral to a specialist? Yeah, if you book an appointment with the support team, then we can do a full examination then. OK. Perfect. All right, then. Take care. Thank you very much. Bye.
