Hello hi I'm Dr Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hi. Hi so just before we start is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please? Yeah uh John Doe. Okay and your date of birth? Um 21 12 and 1986. And your address for me please? It is uh number one London street um n w three six p q. That's correct and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation? We are yes. Okay so I understand you're having a headache is that correct? Uh yeah I've had a sort of a fairly sort of bad severe headache for the past four days um and um I've been sort of feeling a bit hot as well. I've got a bit of a temperature I think I haven't measured it but um I think I think I've got a fever. Okay right and um so what started first was it the headache or the fever? Um so um headache started uh first um and then sort of yeah fever sort of came along a bit afterwards. Okay afterwards right and what have you taken so far for your headache? Um so I've had some paracetamol and some ibuprofen but it's not really helping at the moment. Okay so just a few more questions with regards to your headache. So do you find it difficult to look at the light? Um no like um it's fine light doesn't seem to bother me too much. Okay uh and is there any pain when you try to move your neck from side to side up and down is there any pain? Um I've got sort of general aching muscles um not necessary sort of in my neck it's kind of a bit all over really. Okay all over right and have you been sick with this headache? No I haven't been sick. Okay and do you have a cough? Uh no no cough. Okay so there's no cough or cold yeah? Uh no. Okay and you your ears are okay there's no earaches? Um no it's it seems to be okay it's fine. Okay all right and with this headache have you experienced any pins and needles in your face arms and legs? Uh no. Okay any muscle weaknesses at all? Um just I suppose general aching body aching. Not not any weakness where you couldn't you know hold a cup or anything like that that's what I mean? Uh no um I'm sort of yeah seems to be fine with that sort of stuff but yeah. Okay and um just a few more questions do you because I don't have any of your background history um do you suffer from any medical conditions? Uh no um general medical history is fine. Fine and no surgical history that no medical or surgical complaints yeah? Uh no um I suppose I have been away to um uh Thailand um a week or so ago um I've had some like usual mosquito bites from sort of traveling around and a friend of mine has also been a bit unwell but um uh yeah that's the only sort of like history per se. Right and um do you have any kind of shivering at all? Do you shivering with the fever? Um I um uh I do feel cold quite a lot um you know it's um no sort of shivering but definitely like a bit cold. Hot and cold yeah? Yeah. Okay right and are you using you've mentioned about the paracetamol and buprenorphine now but are you on any regular any medication anything that you're using at all? Uh no. Okay um any allergies at all? Uh no um. All right okay and okay so uh I I believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you yeah uh it's not of possible for us to do that online. I think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination and I think you would need one quite urgently. Okay so the things that's running in the back of my mind are um kind of a viral illnesses that can one can get with um sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel like malaria um the other common thing around Thailand it will be like some dengue but that would have like you would have some uh blood spots or bleeding or something but you don't have at the moment do you? Uh no I mean I've got a bit of a rash but nothing like uh no no no no bleeding. Okay so where's the rash? Um it's uh rash is kind of all all over my body like how would it's not really localized. How would you describe the rash? Um uh sort of red and itchy. Red and itchy okay so if you want to put a glass on top of the rash does that rash go away? Uh yes it goes away. Okay okay so what we need to do is we need to urgently examine you and that's sometime today okay and um after our examination there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to the hospital but I'm not sure as yet so I'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible. Okay. Um I'll write night notes in and recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor preferably in the next few hours time okay and um in any case if that's not available I'd like you to take yourself to A&E. Okay. All right any questions at all? Uh no I'm serious. It's you know obviously when I've spoken to you you didn't tick the box for many theories but you're in the middle somewhere let's put it that way. Okay. Um if you you know things like we have to rule out is meningitis and all but then you just have a general muscle ache you didn't say that you had things like you had problems looking at light or something so those are things when we think of meningitis but and then it's the uh in meningitis you get a non-blanching rash while in any kind of virus you know the rash usually goes away saying that we don't know whether these are the beginning stages so that's why I'd rather but I would rather you see a GP as soon as possible if uh we've got a slot available but if not I think you need to be seen and maybe have some blood tests and examinations. Okay. Okay cool thank you very much. All right you take care then bye now. Cheers. Bye.
