Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you well. Hi. My name is Dr. Gohil. I'm one of the doctors that works at Babylon. Can I check your name and date of birth, please? Yes. My name is Roberto Mendoza. Okay. I was born on the 1st of January of 1992. Okay. And are you in a space that's quiet and you're able to talk? Oh, sorry. Sorry, I'm 48. Sorry, I forgot that. So you're 48. And are you able to talk at the moment? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Tell me, it says here you have a... You're having problems going to the toilet? Yes. So I have a... I don't know how to say it properly in English. I mean... Like diarrhea. Okay. Yeah. So it's lasting for like three days. And yeah, I don't know. I don't know what would cause it. I have a bit of pain, abdominal pain, and I had a bit of vomiting. And yeah. But these are kind of like what is happening to me. Okay. Tell me how you were three days ago before this started. Did you have any medical problems? So I have asthma and I take some inhaler. Okay. I don't know. I take an inhaler. I have an allergy. I have NKDA allergy. Okay. I don't know if it's because... I don't know. Because of the inhaler. Yeah. And apart from asthma, do you have anything else? I don't know. Maybe it's because, you know, it's this thing here in the stomach and stuff. I always have in the back of my head my father because he died about ten years ago of cancer. Okay. So, yeah, this is kind of my worries. I don't know. Okay. So you've had the diarrhea for three days and now you're having pain and vomiting? Yes. Yes. Has the diarrhea been getting better or worse? I think it's not getting better or worse. It's kind of like normal. Okay. It hasn't gone away. It hasn't worsened. Okay. And how often do you go to the toilet? I go... I need to go... I can't go to work because I need to go like every... I don't know. It's this feeling like I go to the toilet and then when I finish I feel I need to go again. Okay. And, yeah, so I need to be like close to the toilet. That must be hard. Yeah, yeah. Have you had to drink more water than normal? I don't know. Maybe I'm not drinking enough water. Yeah. I drink... I think I... Yeah, I don't know. I think I don't drink enough water. An important question. Have you noticed any blood? No, I haven't noticed any blood. And you mentioned tummy pain. Can you tell me more about your tummy pain, like where it is and if it goes anywhere? So the pain is mainly focusing in the center area of the abdomen, like under the belly, under the belly button. Yeah. And sometimes I can hear my stomach, like the cramps. You've been able to eat and drink? Yes, but I go to the toilet so often, so I try not to eat a lot because I just go to the toilet every ten minutes. And you said the tummy pain is in the middle of your tummy. Does it go anywhere else? No, no. Just there. And it seems to be alleviated a bit in the toilet. And maybe it's like gas. I don't know what it is, but... Okay. And when was the last time you vomited? I think it was this morning. This morning. But the thing is, because I'm not eating anything now, so I haven't vomited again. Did you have any breakfast? I don't know. I didn't. No, sorry. Yes, I did, actually. I did. Hold on. I had some fruit. I had some fruit. Okay. And you vomited that up afterwards? And afterwards, I didn't have anything. Then I got a bit of nausea and I vomited. And that was it. And I haven't eaten since then. So now I think I'm okay. But, yeah. Did you notice any blood when you vomited? I think I do. I think I do. But this... No, no. Actually, I can't say. Sorry. I'm sorry. I don't think there is blood. Because, yeah, it was a strawberry that I was having for breakfast. So, yeah, it wasn't blood. Okay. And a couple of years ago, did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain? I don't know. To be honest, sometimes I have, when I get a bit of anxiety, I use my inhaler. Yeah. But my inhaler kind of ran out. The one. Because, you know, I'm a foreigner. So I have this brand. But I bought a new one here. Okay. And I don't know. Maybe this new one has caused it. Okay. It's a problem. I don't know. Okay. It's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this. Normally, it's when you eat bad food or food that has gone off. And you normally get symptoms like you have suggested. But just to double check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing? I always have problems with my breathing because of the asthma. Like, when I take a shot, I need to use my inhaler a little bit. But apart from the normal, I haven't. Okay. And how about chest? Have you noticed any chest pain? No. No. I haven't noticed any chest pain. Okay. And how about walking and talking? Are those all both okay? Walking and talking, yes. Yes. But, yeah, I don't walk very far because I need to go to the toilet now and then. So I'm spending some time at home. And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain? Oh, it does a little bit. Okay. Sorry, I was just writing some things down. Sure. So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain. Okay. And this is normally called gastroenteritis, so an infection of the tummy. Okay. Normally, when patients have this, we do three things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because you're losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers. So if you start getting a temperature, then you need to take amphetamol. And number three is stay home for the time being until you get slightly better. Okay. Okay. And normally things like antibiotics don't help. They make the situation worse. Okay. Go ahead. Sorry. No, I was saying I didn't have any fever recently. I was sweating a little bit in class for bed, but I'm not sure if I had a bit of fever, but very little. But I don't think so. I don't know. Maybe. So I think that's what we should do for the time being. If you feel you're getting much worse, then I would suggest you go and see your GP in real life, in person, so they can look at your belly. Okay. I will book then. I will wait a couple of days to see, or one per day, and then I will book. Great. Yeah. Cool. Do you have any more questions for me? No, that's it. I was maybe just concerned about my father's medical history, if that would add some kind of risk. So the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had. But if your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look at from the GP. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. Thank you very much, doctor, for your time. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
