Oh hello. Hi. Hi, how are you doing? My name is Joe, I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I have your name please? Yeah, sure. Daniel. Hi Daniel. And your date of birth? Yeah, male, 1992. 92. Okay Daniel. And are you in a comfortable and confidential place at all? Yeah, totally. Happy to go ahead. Great. How can I help? Um, yeah, I just, my chest has been feeling really tight. Okay, and how long has this been going for, Daniel? Uh, for about three hours now. Okay, and so tight chest, three hours, and so you were born in 92, so it makes you 26. Um, 26, yeah. And you are, uh, any shortness of breath at all with that? Yeah, like a little bit, um, yeah, a little bit short of breath. Not too bad. Uh, any cough, wheeze? Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well. Coffee, coughing, yeah. Tight cough, yeah. Yeah. Sore throat, runny nose, sore ears? You know, I had a cold last week, and it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose, just feeling under the weather. You're feeling better now other than the tight chest? I mean, I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore. Right, okay. Okay, but now you've got this, this, so you've still got, still got, uh, symptoms of a cold, essentially. Yeah, the cough's kind of stuck around. Yeah, okay. Are you coughing up anything? Uh, no. And, um, do you have any other medical problems, like asthma? Yeah, yeah, I have asthma. I've had it for a while now, um, and then I have, like, a hay fever, you know, some allergies to dust. Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any, any medications? Um, yeah, so, uh, you know, the, um, uh, Ventolin, it's called, uh, Salbutamol. Yeah. I got that one, and then I have a steroid, uh, Clenil, Clenil inhaler. Clenil modulate, yeah, okay. Yeah. And, um, uh, have you been using Clenil and the Ventolin, and how often have you been using them? Um, well, to be honest, I was away at uni last week, and I forgot to bring it with me, so I haven't really in the past week. Because, because, um, sorry, they ran out, and I, I forgot to go and grab the next one. Yeah, sure. About a week ago. Okay. All right. All right. So, so, so you, you haven't got any Clenil or any Ventolin at the moment? Not with me right now. No, I ran out. Okay. All right. Um, and, uh, any drug allergies that you know of? No, no, not allergic to anything. Just, like, just the dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs. Okay, great. Now, uh, do you, anyone in your family have any medical problems you know of? Um, yeah, my mom has eczema, and my dad has asthma. Oh, when I was young, I also had eczema, and I had the milk protein allergy when I was young, too. Okay. Um, all right. So, just, uh, do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on, or, um, hopes for this consultation? Um, not really. Like, I feel like asthma's probably a part of it, and probably getting my inhalers wouldn't be helpful. Um, it's just kind of scary, because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight, uh, in a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I can, I can imagine. Um, well, it certainly sounds like, uh, if you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough, um, and it's a non-productive cough, and you're short of breath. Is the cough worse at night time? I mean, it gets a little bit worse at night, but basically, just pretty consistent. Yeah. It hasn't gone away. Okay. And you've got this tight, tight chest. You wouldn't say you've got chest pain, it's more a tight chest, is it? No, not really pain. It's more, like, tight. It just feels like sometimes I can't get a full breath in, you know? Yeah, sure. Um, okay. Well, I would quite like to, uh, certainly get you some, uh, Ventolin, clean or modulate. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit more, like, back in high school. Um, but I've been pretty good at taking my, my inhalers. So not, not so much anymore. Have you ever been to hospital, uh, as an inpatient, as in, you know, stayed in there overnight for asthma? Yeah. When I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat. Oh, okay. So, so, so you, uh, you had, you went to hospital and had a, uh, so you stayed in hospital for a few days, did you, with an asthma exacerbation? Yeah, I did. Yeah. Okay. But currently you're just on Ventolin and Clenol, and you haven't got any of those steroids, uh, those inhalers. I'd be pretty good. I'd be pretty good just on the Clenol and the Salbutamol. Okay. When, sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation? Uh, I think I was like 17, 16, maybe. Sure. Okay. Um, just to quantify how short of breath you are, um, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you. No, you won't have, will you? Are you able to like walk up flight of stairs? Okay. Walk on the flat. Okay. Without getting too short breath or are you short of breath at rest? I'm definitely not short of breath at rest. Like, except for that feeling I was describing, it does when I'm walking upstairs, I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be. Sure. Yeah. Okay. But you're not short of breath at rest at the moment. No, no, no, I'm not. Okay. Fine. So what, what I think, um, and just, just to go over, is there anything you'd hoped about getting other than the, uh, a prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting on this? I just want to know that I'm okay to just like keep, I just don't want to have to get, um, that, that intubation again. Sure. Yeah. Well, I'm really glad you've talked to me today. I think what we can do is, is give you a prescription for, uh, some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within the hour, I would hope. Um, and, uh, I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So this is, these are tablets which, um, you can take for five days, uh, two tablets in the morning and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response. Okay. Okay. Um, now there are some side effects to the steroids, which I should really tell you about, but please read the label it's associated with. Don't be too worried about the side effects. They're uncommon. Most, you know, most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated and, uh, you probably, do you, have you had them in the past? Do you know? Sorry, sorry. You were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Have you had steroids in the past? Um, I can't remember. Probably. Probably. Yeah. So, um, they, they can come, they can make you, your mood change can be slightly low or slightly high. It can give you a high blood sugar. Um, and, that they can also cause rash, nausea, um, headaches, but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help your asthma an awful lot. Um, uh, what I like to do is, is send you these, the, some prescriptions for your, uh, inhalers are ongoing. So, um, you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can, you can use the Clenol Modulate in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN. So, Ventolin when you need to, um, when you're getting dizzy. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than, uh, every three hours, uh, at any time, it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So, um, see a doctor, um, in some capacity. Uh, and the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Have you, do you know what spacer is? Have you used one before? Yeah. Yeah. I, somebody told me how to use it on a while ago. I don't, I don't really use it to be honest, but. Have you got one? I think I do. I have one somewhere. Okay. All right. Well, um, I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside breathing in and out, um, uh, for five or 10 breaths. Okay. Uh, yeah. So, uh, was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage? I think you got me covered. Okay. Um, and, uh, it might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but, uh, I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better. If you're okay with that. All right. Alrighty. Well, thank you very much. No worries. Any deterioration, new symptoms like worsening shortness of breath, um, or just generally concerning symptoms, uh, pain in your chest, tightness, uh, feeling lightheaded, uh, then seek further medical attention. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
