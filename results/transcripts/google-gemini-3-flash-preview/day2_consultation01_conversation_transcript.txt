Hi there. Good morning.
Hi.
I’m Dr. Mirza from Babylon.
Hi.
Can you hear me okay?
Yeah, I can hear you fine.
Yeah, okay great. Well, nice to see this morning. Before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth please?
Yeah. Jack Smith, 31st of October 1990.
That’s perfect, thank you Jack. Are you in a private place where you’re okay to speak at the moment?
I am, yes.
Okay, great. So, tell me what’s been going on. You’ve been saying there’s a problem with your hearing, is that right?
Yeah, I just feel like I can’t really hear as well as I used to, like my hearing’s kind of deteriorating in some way.
Right, okay. How long has this been going on for?
About six weeks.
Six weeks. Okay. And before that have you had any hearing problem at all?
I had something maybe about a year ago, but it only lasted a couple of days, it wasn’t anything as long as this, so...
Right, okay. Okay. And in this six-week period, have you had anything else happen? Have you had any other ear symptoms at all?
I occasionally get like a ringing in my left ear, just on the one side, and there’s actually been a few times when I’ve felt kind of a bit sick or a bit dizzy as well.
Right, okay. And just to clarify, the difficulty you’ve got in hearing, is that both ears or just the left ear?
Just the left ear, yeah.
All right. So your right ear is fine.
It seems to be, yeah.
Okay. So you’ve had ringing, difficulty hearing in your left ear, and feeling slightly sick. And that’s been on and off for the six weeks, or is it continuous throughout that six weeks?
It’s kind of on and off, like some things trigger it as well. So for example, if I’m watching TV or listening to music or something, that’ll set off the ringing in the ear.
Right, okay. And have you had any pain from the ear at all?
No, not really.
Okay. Any discharge coming out of the ear?
No.
Okay. Have you been experiencing any fever?
Not specifically, apart from the dizziness and sickness I mentioned before.
Right, okay. And has your ear been itchy at all?
No.
Okay. Now, do you use cotton wool buds to try and clean out wax from your ears?
No, I don’t.
No, okay. Well, you’re right, you shouldn’t be doing that. It doesn’t clean out the wax, it pushes it back in. All right. The first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear, okay? And just exclude the simple things. The simple things might be wax. You know, someone might have impacted wax blocking the tube going into the eardrum which can lead to muffled hearing. If that’s the case, that’s something that’s easily fixable. But so we need to exclude that first and then after that we can consider other potential possibilities. And for that, we need to have a look inside the eardrum. So what I think we could do is maybe if we book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics. It’s not an emergency, it can be done within the next four-five days or so, okay? And then what I’ll do is I’ll send a message to our admin team. I’ll ask them to slot you in in a clinic, one of our clinics in that time frame. You can come in and one of the GPs will just have a quick look down the ear and figure out whether there’s a physical blockage or whether there’s something else going on, okay?
Okay.
Can I just double-check, the dizziness that you’ve been getting, how severe is it?
It’s nothing major, it’s just kind of it’s that kind of dizziness you get with nausea, like not not proper room spinning or anything like that, but just just a little bit kind of off balance and...
Right, right. Okay. Have you had any chest pain with it?
No.
No. Any palpitations, heart beating fast?
Not that I’m aware of.
Okay, fine. All right. So let’s get your ear checked out. I think that would be the most sensible thing to do. And then after that we could we’ll be a step closer to figuring out which way we’re going to go. It might be that there’s a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear, but we just need to exclude whether there’s a physical blockage first and try and deal with that if that’s the case, okay?
Is that the sort of thing that can cause like this ringing I’ve got in my ear?
Well, you know the ringing that you’ve got, you’ve got something called tinnitus, okay? And tinnitus is something actually that medicine, doctors, we don’t really understand it fully. We haven’t in you know, people can’t give you a specific cause for why some patients get tinnitus and some patients don’t. It can be triggered by a wide range of different things. And in fact, I’m glad that you’ve mentioned that. What I might do in the time between now and when you come for the appointment, I’m going to put place the link for a leaflet about tinnitus in the notes for this appointment. I’d really appreciate it if you could start reading about it, okay? And often that awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are—and there are limited options—that helps us in in terms of the conversation about what we do next if your ear is clear, okay? So I’m going to paste the link to that and you can read about that. And what we’ll do is we’ll see you in about four-five days’ time. It won’t be with me, it’ll be another GP, but they’ll have my notes and they’ll know exactly what what my question is, which is just to check your ears. Is that okay?
Yeah, that sounds great.
All right, great. So bear with me five minutes and then you can ring the support team. I’ll leave the number in the notes for this appointment. Ring them and then they’ll slot you in, okay?
Okay, brilliant.
All right, then. If any if there’s any problem, any issue between now and when the clinic appointment is, just book another appointment and you can speak to one of us over video, okay?
Okay.
All right then, take care. Nice to see you this morning.
Thank you. You too.
Okay, bye-bye.
