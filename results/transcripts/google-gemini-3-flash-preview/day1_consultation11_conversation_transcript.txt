Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me okay? I can hear you but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Um. Is that okay am I meant to just have a voice connection on the screen? It's audio and no that's absolutely fine. Now before I go any further can I confirm your name and your age? Um so um so my name is Dan Chaudhary I am 27. 27 okay. And how can I help you this afternoon Dan? Um so I've just um been having some troubles basically in the it was I guess it's been a little while now and I've just been feeling not so great and it's all come from like uh it's like basically I think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out loads of it like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and yeah it doesn't feel very solid so it just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's uh yeah it's just um not been very pleasant and like I just it just kind of hasn't doesn't feel like it's getting better so. Well no sorry to hear that seems like there's a lot going on there. Well when did it all start your symptoms? Um so I think it was a few when I think about it so Monday Tuesday I so I think it was about three it's been about three days now. Okay and is it mainly diarrhea so you mentioned watery stools how many times are you going a day would you say? Um so I I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Right wow okay so you're losing a lot of fluid there. Yeah so I mean I'm trying to drink a lot of water but um yeah it's just quite a lot and uh it's um yeah I think I I feel like it's just just fluids coming out. Okay have you noticed any blood in your stools? Um so I no I don't remember anything like no I think it's just nothing like that there's nothing like that. And any any tummy pain any any pain in your tummy? Yeah I mean I it I feel a cramp and then and then I know it's time to go right? So around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go so yeah I mean that's the kind of the first sign. And where is this crampy pain which part of your tummy? It's kind of so when I if I think about it it's like it's like at the bottom I don't know if that makes sense um. Well why don't we start with is it in the middle or is it towards one particular side? Um I I think if it feels pretty like in the middle to me not on any side left or right. Okay and does this pain come and go or is it there constantly? Um it it comes and goes it comes and goes. Fine okay. And if I was to ask on a scale of one to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever had how bad is this pain? Okay so like um so what do you mean by pain? So I think it's maybe is this pain that's making you double over is ten as ten the worst pain you've ever had or is it more of a kind of a mild pain like a three out of ten? I guess so I'm when I think about it like when I get it I can pretend that I don't feel it so I can still sit down and I can still like cover it up and people don't really notice so I I don't know what that means but maybe is that like a six or a seven? Sounds like a solid six actually okay. All right good. Um apart from the pain and diarrhea any other symptoms like nausea vomiting? Um yeah I definitely I definitely feel kind of nauseous um like I and like I have vomited and when I like I think it's maybe something to do with like whenever I have like milk or something like that I just feel like I want to vomit and actually like yeah one time I just like had some milk and then I just completely vomited it up but um yeah I've been trying to avoid it but um yeah. And the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea is that right? Um sorry could you repeat that? The vomiting is not as prominent as the diarrhea is that right? Um no no it's not. Okay okay all right. Um any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? Um so yeah I think I am pretty I feel kind of really hot all the time and I'm pretty sure I'm burning up I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that but it's uh yeah I'm pretty sure I'm um not um like not a normal temperature. Okay so you're feeling hot okay and in terms of your waterworks are you passing urine okay? Um yeah but I guess less frequently maybe um but yeah it seems to be okay. Okay all right um fine and you said mention three days ago was when it all kicked off are you aware of any triggers I mean have you for example gone out had some takeaway food have you been around anyone else with diarrhea for example? Um so I know so my um my brother has had actually had something like this for um he has it as well for five days as well um and I'm not yeah I can't think of what what the trigger is for me I mean my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me but um yeah that's why. Is your brother now better? Um he so he's been like this for five days I think he's getting better but I'm not I'm not really sure he said he had he's had something for a little while as well. Okay all right. Are you having anything to eat or drink I can see you're drinking your coffee but are you keeping it down are you keeping your fluids down? Um so it just feels like um the fluids do go down but it just feels like it's going straight through it just feels like it's going straight through. Okay all right fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat which kept in which which you kept in? Um so I had some I mean I had some lunch today um but again it just it did just come come out pretty loose. Okay all right. Um and Dan moving forwards are you otherwise fit and well or do you have any other medical history? Um so I um yeah I think otherwise I'm fit and well I um yeah I mean I'm an okay weight and um I I can't think of any related medical history um I mean like my yeah I no I don't think so. I take it you don't take any regular medications then? So I um no I mean I've been taking some like paracetamols and stuff like that lately but I haven't been I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. Okay and do you have any allergies to any medications? Um so I don't have any allergies that I know of. Okay and what about any family history do you have any family history of bowel problems? Um bowel so would bowel like does is the colon like something like that? Yeah so what I mean by bowel is the whole gut really anything from the mouth to the anus so. So my yeah my dad actually has um colon cancer at the moment. Oh dear I'm very sorry to hear that how is he? So um from what I heard he's kind of so I don't I don't speak to him that often so I don't I don't know the exact details and I don't exactly know the full things of like the the steps of cancer and all that kind of thing but um he's sort of in his third stage um I'm not sure what that means exactly um but yeah so um yeah it's um he's yeah you can I can see he's kind of weak and it's affected him a lot and that sort of thing so he's quite I guess he's um had it for a little while now. I'm sorry to hear I'll make a note of that because it's always important to know these kind of details. Um and socially tell me more about your home situation who's at home with you Dan? Um so uh not my brother he doesn't live with me um I live with my sister and my mom. Okay and uh how are things at home? Um I mean in what sense do you mean? Just in general day-to-day life are you managing okay any particular stresses? I mean um I think um yeah it's been tricky um going to work with all of this um I dislike um taking time off work I feel like I I just want to go um when I can so I just try and go um when I can I think at home um yeah I haven't really um I don't normally actually um eat with my family I'm normally buying stuff and that kind of thing so I don't think it's affected them and I haven't really been haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mom about it um yeah I'd just rather deal with these things um so yeah. You mentioned work what is it you do for work? Um so I work at I work at um an office um in central London um it's uh so I work in government. Government okay so office okay right just a couple last final couple of questions smoking and alcohol do you do either do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Um so I I smoke um I smoke uh for like socially but not like regularly um so normally if if it's a Friday or something like that I might I might have a cigarette or something like that but um not regularly. Sorry? And the alcohol? So alcohol um you know I might have a a beer during the weekdays maybe not that many maybe um one or two on Fridays I have more alcohol um yeah a quite a lot more units um on a I suppose not every week but maybe um once or twice a month but yeah I'll go out with my friends and we'll drink a lot so that that's um yeah. Well thank you for sharing with me that's very helpful to know. So Dan just as a conclusion um just to wrap it all up I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis. Okay. Bit of a basically an infection of your tummy or of your gut. It's nothing to worry about I I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days just like it did for your brother. Drink make sure you drink plenty of fluids okay? Should I just drink like normal water? I just feel like every time I drink it's just coming out um. Well clear fluids is probably best but I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins um so you can get things like Dioralyte which is um a fluid replacement you can get from the pharmacy it's probably worth recommending that. Oh do I need like a prescription for that? No you can just get that over the counter. Okay. Um you can try just you know regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days so 48 hours I want you to give me a call back because um you know if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations okay? But I think let's let's see how you are over the next one to two days. Okay. And uh we'll catch up soon okay? Okay so you're saying that I should I could um I'll try and buy this Dioralyte what what should I do in terms of um food and that kind of thing should I just focus on fluids? Food as well yeah absolutely clear fluids you can use soft diet things like soup mash and then gradually build up um as much as your body can tolerate um but really let's try and keep yourself well hydrated first okay? Okay is it okay for me to carry on having like um paracetamol and things like that? Absolutely if you are having if you've got a bit of tummy pain if you're feeling feverish then I think paracetamol is very sensible. Okay. Try and avoid alcohol if you can. Um okay I'll try yeah. Okay Dan. Okay thank you for your help. All right thank you very much thanks for helping me out. Goodbye for now. Okay. Bye.
