Hello. Hi there. Hi, hi there. My name's Joe, I'm one of the doctors at Babylon. I just can I confirm your name please? Hi there, yeah, my name's Brian. Sorry what, sorry your name was? Name was Brian. Brian, hi Brian. Nice to meet you. And your date of birth. Yeah, my date of birth is the 8th of August 1982. Great. And are you in a sort of confidential place where you can speak freely? Yeah, no, no one else can hear me. Great, and you're happy to continue with the consultation. Yes. Marvelous. Okay, so how can I help today? Yeah, so basically it's just been happening over the last few weeks or so. I don't really feel like, like getting up in the morning is really difficult and I don't have much energy at all during the day. Often yeah just like doing most things that I would normally find easy has become quite difficult. Okay, so things have become quite difficult for you. Yeah. Is there anything else? Um, of those it's quite hard to say like things like I'm not eating very much at the moment, I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy. Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had difficulty waking up, no energy, not eating. And that's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks do you mean two or three or five, how roughly? Well now I kind of think about it maybe even longer. I guess it might be related to so I also started a new job slightly recently. It might have even coincided with that job a couple of months ago. When did you start your new job? Two months ago you say? Yeah. Okay. And so this has been going on perhaps for sort of six weeks or so. More like two months I'd say, yeah. Okay. All right. So is there anything that you're particularly sort of concerned about or hoping to get out of this consultation? Well I know that it's not really normal for me so before this phase started happening you know I wouldn't have any problem sort of eating what I want to eat or you know doing standard things in life and what I want to do is like kind of return to that previous state somehow. I'm not sure how that is, what the best ways of doing that are but if you could give some advice or whatever that would be really useful. Okay. Sure. Okay, well what I'd like to do is just ask you a few more sort of questions around what's been going on and also around your background health and things like that. And then we can go on to sort of what can be done from there. Is that all right? Okay. Okay great. So you say you've been feeling unwell with not a lot of energy, difficult waking up in the mornings. Do you tend to just on that note do you tend to wake up early and then stay in bed in the mornings? Um, actually I'm just not not really waking up early it's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all probably. I think that's probably closer. Difficulty sleeping as well. Yeah. And how have you and how has your mood been over this period? Have you been feeling your usual distracted? I'd say. I kind of um yeah finding it really hard to quite difficult to focus I would say. Not unhappy or happy but just quite just not focused. Okay, so difficulty focusing, quite distracted. And would you say you've been in good spirits or is your mood low? Um, actually now you mention it like my mood is a bit lower recently and so I've noticed like my sex drive has kind of decreased a bit over the past few months as well. So yeah. Okay. So lower mood, decreased sex drive recently as well. And just on that note just a few questions around that. Are you able to maybe slightly personal questions but if you're okay to answer these. Do you tend to to have morning erections like you is that something that you've noticed? I haven't noticed anything like that specifically no. So so you're saying that you have not noticed morning erections and usually you would. It's a sort of normal thing to have waking up in the morning with something but you have not noticed those recently. I have not noticed those recently. Okay. So and that's been a change has it? Um, important one I don't think. Sorry? Yeah I don't think it's an important change no. I sorry are you you don't think there's been a change there? No there hasn't been a change to that. Okay sorry right. Sorry okay. So um just going back to the mood symptoms as well you're saying you've had difficulty focusing, easily distracted. Your mood has been slightly lower with lower sex drive. Yeah. And in what way is your sex drive been lower? Are you in a relationship at the moment? Yeah I'm married. I've been for for many years. Mhm. And yeah just over the last few months just been disinterested. Disinterested. Okay sorry you froze there for a moment. Um so less interested as well. Okay. And just to ask you a few questions before we carry it wrap up is any significant past medical history so do you suffer from any mental health problems in the past or any physical health problems? No. Um so in the past um I have a history of hypothyroidism. Hypo? Hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism. Yeah. Okay so that's high thyroid just to sort of confirm that. Sorry can you say that again please? Hyper as in high hyperthyroid. Hypo. Hypo okay hypothyroid thank you. Thank you. Um yeah. Okay. And also in the past I mean I haven't had any kind of specific medical diagnosis along these lines but there's a suspicion that it may have had an impact on me but my father has committed suicide about 15 years ago. Okay. Okay and um do you take any medications? I have a drug history of thyroxine. Mhm. So maybe yes. Do you continue to take thyroxine now? Yes. You do. So you're taking thyroxine at the moment. Yes. Cool. And any drug allergies are you allergic to any medications? No I have no medication allergies no. No allergies. And you mentioned the the suicide of your father 15 years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other um significant family history of medical conditions or psychiatric conditions? No. No depression or anything like that running in the family or anything like that. No nothing nothing of that sort. Okay. And your mother is is well? Any brothers or sisters? Yeah she's fine. And no I'm an only child. Okay. So I just uh sorry might seem like slightly random question but any change in your vision? No no nothing like that. No change in vision. Okay and just to go back to your you're saying you had low mood. Some people who are who do have low mood and low sex drive can sometimes feel suicidal as well. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else? No. No not really no. No. And are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities that you have done in the past? Sometimes. I mean I guess most of the activities but when I've been doing sports as well um I find sometimes it's quite difficult to breathe um so I have some kind of like shortness of breath um when doing sports compared to maybe a couple of months ago. Okay so you've become more short of breath over the last few months. Yeah. And okay so um any other things around there so more fatigue, more shortness of breath over the last few months um with a slow lower mood decreased sex drive. Um is there just before we wrap up is there anything else that you would like to talk about? No nothing specific no. So um getting a little bit towards the end now but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you. I would like to probably see you in person and do an examination and and also we would probably like to do some blood tests as well. So do you think it would be possible to see to book an appointment in the next few days with your GP or or that would be ideal I think here. Um and then we can we could probably do some more do an examination and do some investigations really to see what's going on here a little bit more. That makes sense. Yeah. Is that all right? Yeah that's very useful thank you. I feel better to have some kind of plan. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think we I definitely think we need a plan here. Um it's been nice talking to you I'm sorry we've ran out of time now. But we've at least started the ball rolling with some further investigations and tests. I'm glad that you know you're you're although you have a low mood um you're not feeling suicidal just to confirm that. Um and and we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some of your tiredness and your other symptoms when we see you. Okay. Thank you very much for taking the time. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.
