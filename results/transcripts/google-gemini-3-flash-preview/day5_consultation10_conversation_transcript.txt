Hi there, it’s Dr. Smith from Babylon. Can you confirm your name, date of birth, and your home address please? Abid Chose... 12th of March... Um, I can’t hear you at the moment actually. Could you turn it up? The volume up? Uh, can you give me... can you hear me better now? Yeah, that’s better. Thank you. Okay, sorry about that. Are you in a private place so you can have a consultation? Um, yes. What can I do for you today? Um, I’ve been having this blinding headache for a few days, um, and it’s like really bothering me, um, I find it very hard to focus, or like I can’t even go to work. Okay. And any headaches in the past before this? Not really, just the on and off. Um, I recently had them, one for like two days, um, but it just went away with ibuprofen, so nothing like for longer than two days before. So how did this start? Um, it just started over sudden. I woke up one morning with a headache, and that was three days ago, and I just keep having it. It doesn’t really go away with ibuprofen either. I tried that, but it just... it gets a little bit better, but like doesn’t go away. Okay. And where abouts in your head is the pain? Um, it’s kind of all over, but I feel like over my right eye is a bit stronger. Okay. Any problems with your vision or any problems tolerating the light? Um, light definitely makes me more sensitive. Like, um, I don’t really like strong light. Um, and, um, yeah, vision... I think I get these shooting lights sometimes. Um, not sure how to explain it. Just a bit of a weird kind of vision. Okay. And um, any... any nausea or vomiting? Hmm, no, feeling a bit sick, but no vomiting. Any tingling or numbness or weakness anywhere? Um, no. Any change in your smell or taste? No, not at all. Um, and in the past when you’ve had headaches, what have they been like? Um, I would say quite normal headaches. Just, um, a bit of a pressure in between my eyes, um, but nothing major. Okay. And with... with this, has it been there all the time or is it coming and going? Kind of all the time. Um, so when I take ibuprofen it gets a bit better, so it’s a bit like less... it bothers me less, but then I still have it. It’s still there. Um, and what would you say the severity is? If... if ten is the worst pain you’ve ever had and zero’s nothing, what would you say the pain is like? I guess it’s mostly eight, and then it come... it comes down to maybe a five. Okay. And what about at night time? Are you able to fall asleep? Um, yeah. I’m sleeping well. Is it waking you up in the night time? No, no. But I can wake up with it in the morning. Okay. Any worse when you change position or bend over or cough or anything like that? Hmm, sometimes when I stand up quickly I get a bit of a stabbing pain, um, or if I turn my head, like, I kind of feel like something is moving inside. Okay. And have you had any, uh, eye checks recently? Um, yeah. I actually had one recently and nothing changed in my vision. Okay. And have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears, or pain over the sinuses? Any cough or phlegm? No. No. Any nosebleeds or coughing up any blood or anything? No. And just recently have you been well, or have you had any general problems? Any change in your weight, or tiredness, lack of energy, anything like that? Um, no change of weight. Maybe a bit of lack of energy, but it might be because I’m just having this headache so I find it difficult to go through my daily activities but, you know, when you have this constant headache. Have you been at work recently? Um, I work from home, but I couldn’t really manage to do it all the time, so sometimes I just take the day off. So, you’ve been... you’ve had headache over three days, how many days have you missed off work? Um, so I worked from home all these three days and... first day I worked from home and then, um, the second day I just took the whole day off and today I just tried to work from home the first half of the day, but I... I just stopped in the morning 'cause I couldn’t focus. Okay. And any other medical problems in the past? Um, I think I only had the abdominal pain, um, when I was younger, but no cause was found and that went away, but that’s the only thing I know of. Okay. Have you been abroad recently at all? No. Do you take any medications? Um, just the pill. Which one? Um, Mercilon. And when did you start that? Um, about a year ago. Any side effects with that? Uh, no, I don’t think so. Have you noticed any... any increased frequency of headache since you started that? Um, no, because this headache just started recently, so nothing, um, about a year ago when... nothing really changed then. Okay. And when you’d had... when you described your headaches in the past, you said they were just general. Did you have any visual symptoms, flashing lights, or nausea, vomiting with them? No, nothing, none of that. Have you had your blood pressure checked recently with your pill? Um, yeah. I had it checked in the pharmacy when I got the pill and they said it was normal. And when was that? Uh, a year ago. Okay. Um, and any allergies to anything? No. And who do you live with at home? Sorry? Who do you live with at home? Uh, just by myself. Okay. And do you smoke? Uh, no. Do you drink any alcohol regularly? Yeah. How much in a normal week do you think? Um, probably like three beers once a week. Okay. And do you take any other drugs at all? Um, no. Apart from the ibuprofen that I take sometimes when the headache gets really bad, but nothing else. Um, so, I mean, it’s obviously the first time you’ve had such a bad headache and you said you’d had some altered light in front of your eyes as well. Yeah. But you haven’t had a high temperature. Have you checked your temperature? Uh, no, I didn’t. But I don’t really feel feverish or anything. Okay. Um, I mean, it... it could possibly be a migraine-type headache, but the fact it’s ongoing for three days, we probably should book you into an appointment to get an examination, um, obviously if it settles in the meantime then we can cancel that, but we should do a neurological examination, look at the back of your eyes as well. Okay. In terms of medication, I can prescribe you something similar to ibuprofen but a bit stronger which you can take instead of ibuprofen, and you can also take paracetamol at the same time. Okay. So if you’re happy to book an appointment with the... with the support line for us to do a full examination, and start the medication which I’ve prescribed, take it with food. If... if your... you said that when you go to bed your headache’s okay and not waking you up in the night time. Yeah, it’s not. Um, but you mentioned migraine, and that... reminded me that my mom suffers from, actually has migraines. Okay. Any other family history of medical problems? Uh, no, I think that’s it. But I know that my mom, like, she has quite bad migraines, she like, has the vomiting and everything with them. Okay, that’s fine. Um, I mean, if in the meantime before your appointment your headache is getting unbearable, getting worse or changing, then call... um, if it’s that bad then you should go to A&E and have an examination. Um, otherwise you can call us for further advice on that. Mhm, okay. And when... when you have an examination with us, we’ll check your blood pressure as well just to make sure your pill is still appropriate for you, because sometimes if... if we do think it’s a migraine, then you would have to change your pill if you’ve had these flashing lights and things like that. Is there anything in the pill that can cause it, or is it...? Well, some... so that pill, if you are having regular migraines with, um, flashing lights or other symptoms, it wouldn’t be suitable to stay on that pill particularly. We’d have to change it to something else. All right. But you can carry on with that for the moment. Okay. Have you got any other questions? Um, so would you, like, um, send me a referral to a specialist, or...? Yeah, if you book an appointment with the support team, then we can do a full examination then. Okay. Perfect. All right then, take care. Thank you very much. Bye. Bye.
