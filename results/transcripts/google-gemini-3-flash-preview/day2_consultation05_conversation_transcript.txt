Hi there, good morning. I'm Dr. Dinith from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. Okay, so um before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth, please? Yes, John Smith and I am 32 years old. Sorry, I didn't catch your date of birth. I'm 32 years old. 32 years old. Okay. Could you tell me the first line of your address and your postcode, please? Yes, 4 Park Avenue and it's AB1 CB2. That's great. Thank you so much for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yes. Okay, so how can I help you today? You've been having some problems with your asthma, is that right? Sorry, say that again. How can I help you today? So um I've been experiencing very weird symptoms over the past month or so. I don't know what's causing them. I have googled it and um nothing's coming up, so I thought I'd come and speak to you about it. Okay, so tell me a bit more about these weird symptoms you've been having. So it started with feeling very tired for a couple of days and then I'd get back to normal. And then I started losing feeling in my hands and arms. I'd get a weird sensation like I get pins and needles. Right. And what'd you say, just say that again, the connection's not so great. You've been getting pins and needles in the hand, is that right? Yeah, that's correct. Okay, is that the right or left hand? My right hand. Is it always the right? Yes. Okay, um we've lost video now. Maybe is there a button you can press? Okay. Are you happy for us to carry on without the video? I can't see you at the moment. Yes, that's fine. All right, um so you've been having these pins and needles episodes of numbness in the right hand. Is it just the hand or does it go up the arm as well? Um the pins and needles are in the hand, but I feel like my arm is getting weaker, but it only lasts three days and then goes back to normal, so it's very weird. Right, okay, and is there any involvement of your leg at all? Er my colleague said I'm walking slightly differently to normal. And again it's only for three days or three or four days. Okay, you said you've been having weird symptoms for about a month. Yes. So what has been happening from the beginning of the month, what else has been happening? Um I generally feel tired and weak and sometimes I feel nauseous and I don't feel like I want to do anything. Right, okay. And um you know your colleague said you've you've not been walking normally. Yes. Do you feel anything different on either side in terms of your legs? Can you, have you noticed anything different? Yes, so at the same time I get my arm symptoms, my leg feels weaker. Right, okay. And you know the abnormal gait, has that been present outside of these episodes? No, it has not. Right, so normally I'm fit and well actually. All right, okay. Um and these these episodes, how often have they been happening? They have been getting more regular, so at the start it would be maybe once a week to once a month, but now it's getting a couple of times a day. Right, okay. And how long have these episodes been going on for? When when did it all start? Probably about a month and a half, maybe two months. Right, okay. Okay, and along with these symptoms of the weakness and numbness, do you have any other symptoms at the same time, like swallowing or difficulty speaking or vision problems? So recently I've noticed I can't hold my cup of coffee and when I do drink coffee it's slightly harder to drink. And that's only been in the last couple of days I guess. Right, is that during these episodes or outside of these episodes? Only during the episodes. Okay. Do you have any difficulty swallowing at all? Not currently, no. During the episodes, do you have any difficulty swallowing? I I feel like there's something in my throat. Okay, what about difficulty speaking during these episodes? Any any issues with that at all? No, I can speak fine. Okay, and any visual problems during these episodes? I don't think so, but I wear glasses. Okay, all right. Now um can I just ask, has is there any history of stroke or mini-strokes in your family? Er yes, my father has had a operation to the side of his neck to reduce the risk of stroke. Right, okay. Um and how about yourself? Have you had any history of mini-strokes or anything like that along those lines? I know you're quite young. No, so after my dad had his operation I was required to be checked and my cholesterol was fine. Good, excellent. So you had a blood test done. Did they check for diabetes as well? They checked my diabetes, my blood pressure, and my cholesterol, and the doctor said it was all okay. Fantastic. Okay. Now do you have any other illnesses at all? No. Are you on any medication? I take an aspirin, 75 milligrams once a day, but that's because of something I read on the internet. Okay, so so why is that? Why do you take that? I think it's meant to reduce your risk of stroke and heart attack. Okay, have you ever told a doctor before, your GP, that you're on aspirin? Yes, I took I started taking it after my father had his operation, but that wasn't the doctor telling me. Okay, and has any GP ever spoken to you about the risks of aspirin and whether you should be on it or have you not told the GP in the past? No, I haven't. You haven't, okay. Um all right, um now in terms of your your kind of social situation, um are you working at the moment? Yes, I am. What do you work as? I'm I'm actually a doctor. You're a a medical doctor? Yes. Okay, which specialty are you in? I work in plastic surgery. Plastic surgery, okay, great. And do you have any allergies to any medication at all? I'm allergic to penicillin only. Okay, and um are you living alone? No, I live with my wife. Right, okay. Fantastic. Do you smoke at all? No, I don't. Right, okay. Um that's fine. Now obviously you're you're a medic yourself, did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on? Er I've actually got no idea. Right, okay. Um well the way you're describing these episodes, they make me concerned about mini-strokes or TIAs, transient ischemic attacks. Um and so that's something quite urgent and given that you've got a family history of stroke, even though you're quite young, I think um it's something that we need to exclude. So what I'm probably going to do, in fact what I am going to do, is I'm going to refer you to a stroke a TIA clinic. Um now just to double-check, do you have the symptoms right now? No, I'm perfectly fine at the moment. Okay, so so what I'm going to do is I'm going to refer you to a mini-stroke clinic or a TIA clinic. Um I'll send that referral off now and then you can attend them, they'll usually call you in within the next one to two days, okay? Because it's something relatively urgent. Now today it's Wednesday so we've got a few days before the weekend, so um um basically the deadline should be Thursday Friday, we're expecting you to be seen by that time, that's the kind of turnaround we're looking at. And in that clinic, they'll be doing a number of things. Um they'll be checking they'll be doing the ultrasound of the carotid arteries like your father had, um and they'll be doing maybe they might do a scan of the brain as well to see if there's any signs of a bleed there. But um they'll be doing a range of tests in a short timeframe in order to exclude whether you have any illness, or whether you've got any kind of stroke or mini-stroke. Now if your symptoms return and they persist, they're prolonged, then um you may need to attend A&E, okay? Because um our presumptive working diagnosis is mini-stroke or TIA, okay? And if a mini-stroke is prolonged then um then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke and in that case that becomes even more of an emergency, so we're not talking about waiting one or two days, we want you to go to hospital in that instance as soon as possible, okay? Sure. Now if things happen again, feel free to contact us, we can assess you over the phone, we can give you direction and guidance over the phone, that's that's no problem, you know you've got easy access to us. Okay? So um this is the plan going forward. Um I'm going to um do that referral, you should hear back from the hospital relatively soon. The hospital, you could actually ring them on um the PALS number and then there's also the TIA clinic number. I'm going to put that number in the notes for this consultation, okay? So you'll have all the information you need to chase this appointment, and um if you want you can ring them either today or tomorrow morning, today in the afternoon wait one or two hours or tomorrow morning just to find out when they plan to slot you in and just to make sure they've got you in the system and they've got you in the books and they're going to be calling you in, okay? So um this isn't an immediate emergency that you need to rush down to A&E, but it's something quite urgent we need to deal with in a short space of time, okay? So if there's if there's any delay that transpires, for example you can't make the appointment or you know they don't get you don't get called, something unexplained, you need to be getting contact back with us, okay? Great. All right, did you have any questions at all? No, I think that covers most of it. Okay great, so just bear with me a few minutes and then I'll send that all through and then you should be able to have you'll have the information at your hands in order to take things further, okay? Great, thank you. All the best, take care then. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
