Um would you be happy to call the support line and arrange that appointment? Yes. Okay. That's fine. So we'll we'll do that. In the meantime, if it gets a lot worse um or you you're not holding any fluids down, um then we should see you before then. Um did you say your pregnancy test was a month ago? Yes. Okay. Um and your Implanon was just put in a year ago. Yes. The other thing we would need to do is to do a pregnancy test today if possible. I will do it. So if you can do that today and if it's positive, we need to see you straight away, so give us a call back. Yes. Okay? Have you got any other questions? No, that's it. Right, okay.
