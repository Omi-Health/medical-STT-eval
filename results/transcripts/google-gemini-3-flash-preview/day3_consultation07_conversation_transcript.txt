Hello.
Hi, hi, my name is Dr. Jacob and welcome to Babylon. How are you?
I’m, I’m good, I mean, I’m, so, I’m bad.
You’re so-so. Okay. Right. So just before we start, is it alright if you could confirm your name for me please?
Albert Shoshaw.
And your date of birth?
17th of January 1987.
And your address for me please?
60 Hanover Steps, um...
That’s great. And just to confirm that you’re in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation.
Yes.
Okay. So you’ve mentioned in our notes that you’ve got a skin problem. If you can tell me a bit more about it please.
Yes, over the past few days I’ve noticed my skin is sore and red.
Okay. So where is it sore and red?
Um, it’s all over my chest, my hands and arms, especially inside of the elbows.
And where in the elbows? I didn’t quite catch that.
On the inside of the elbows.
Inside of the elbows, yeah.
Which is the worst area.
Alright, the worst area. Is it very itchy?
It’s very itchy and dry all over my body.
Itchy and dry. Okay. Have you had something like this in the past?
Yes, yes, I have, I had eczema in the past.
Okay. Do you think this is similar to your usual eczema or is it worse?
I think it’s, yes, it’s gotten worse like these past few days.
Yeah, but you think it could be like something similar. So on your skin is there any, you know, any of the patches, you’ve mentioned it’s quite sore, is it weeping? Is it like watery liquid coming from that area? Weeping?
No.
Nothing that you’ve noticed. Okay.
Right.
But some of the areas are cracked.
Yeah, so you have cracks over there. Okay. And is there any scratch marks on your, on any of the, you know, areas? Any scratch marks?
I mean, it’s very itchy so I’ve scratched myself but no scratch marks.
Okay. Is there any thickened skin? Like, you know, where the skin’s very thick and darkened areas?
No.
No, I don’t think so.
Okay. Alrighty. So you’ve mentioned you’ve got a history of eczema, so what do you do about it? How do you keep it under control?
Yeah, usually I use a cream called Diprobase.
Diprobase, yeah.
In the shower I use something called Dermol.
Dermol, alright. And have you been using them recently or not?
Yes, yes, I used them.
You use them every day?
Yes, I, there’s no change in that. I didn’t change any.
Okay. Have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema?
Um, I, I’m not sure. Ah, yes. Yes, I’ve used steroids in the past.
You’ve used steroids in the past.
But it’s, it’s not helping.
Yeah, so you’re still using the steroids.
Yeah, I tried, I tried.
Which one are you using the steroids? What’s the name?
I’m not sure, it’s, I have it but the box is not there.
Okay, so is it like the over-the-counter ones?
Sorry?
Over-the-counter hydrocortisone, does that ring a bell?
Yeah, so you’re using the hydrocortisone, yeah?
Are you using any antihistamines at all?
No.
No, no antihistamines. Okay.
Right.
Fine. Otherwise, other than this rash, you’re feeling well in yourself? There’s no temperature, no joint pains, yeah?
No joint pains. But I’ve tried antihistamines and it didn’t work.
You’ve tried the antihistamines and didn’t work. Okay. Which one did you try?
The one over the counter.
Okay, so like Cetirizine, yeah?
Yeah, okay. That’s fine.
Right.
Okay, so from what you’re describing it looks like, you know, it is quite widespread, your eczema, yeah? Because you’re having it all over your chest and hands and things like that.
Um, so do you have any allergies to any medication at all?
No, no allergies.
No allergies. Okay. And you don’t other than eczema you don’t have any other medical condition?
I have asthma and in my family there is hypothyroidism and migraine. My mother has migraine.
Mother has migraine and what was the other one? I didn’t understand.
Hypothyroidism.
Hypothyroidism. Who has hypothyroidism?
My mother.
Okay, so she has hypothyroidism. Okay. That’s fine.
Righty. You mentioned you have asthma. So what medications are you using for asthma?
Um, ah, you know, blue inhaler.
The blue inhaler, so you don’t, you don’t use it every day? So you just use it on and off, yeah?
Yeah, yeah.
Blue inhaler. But your breathing’s all okay, yeah?
It’s okay, yeah. Yeah, it’s only, it’s only when I have a flare I use it.
Sure. So what we need to do is obviously you’ve got extensive as I’ve mentioned so extensive eczema. What we’ll do is we’ll need a couple of things because to keep you a bit comfortable we’ll, you would probably need some antihistamines which I’m going to prescribe. Also hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you use for young children, you might probably need a bit more stronger one like Betnovate or something like that. Okay? So we’ll try that first. So I’m going to give, it’s called, the antihistamine is called Fexofenadine and then we’ll try with some Betnovate first. So it’s like very small amount like it’s like one fingertip, yeah? This much is, is enough to cover your palms and the back of your hands, yeah? So it’s very small amount. So that if you can imagine you can cover with the very small amount the whole body. Yeah? So use that. You have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks. Okay? If, if there’s no improvement you need to get back to us or if you have any kind of adverse reaction like an allergic reaction which is unlikely but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us. Okay?
Okay. Thank you very much.
Okay. So what we’re going to do is we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy, it looks like Boots on the system. Is that correct? Yeah?
Yes.
Yes, so I’ll send it across to Boots and it will be there for collection. If things are getting worse in the next two weeks call us beforehand, otherwise wait for two weeks, take the medication and the cream. You still need to continue on your emollients like the Dermol soap and as well as the Diprobase. Yeah? So you still need to use those in the interim. Any questions at all?
No. No questions. Thank you.
Excellent. You take care then. Bye-bye now.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye, bye.
