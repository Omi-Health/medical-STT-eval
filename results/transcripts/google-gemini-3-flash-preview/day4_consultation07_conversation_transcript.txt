Hello, can you hear me okay?
Hey, yes, I can. Can you hear me?
Yes, good, good. So my name is Joe, I'm a doctor here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please?
My name's Vincent.
And your date of birth?
9th of May 2016. Oh... sorry.
Okay, great. And are you in a safe place, oh sorry, a safe and confidential place to talk and discuss the consultation?
Yes, yes, I am.
Great. So how can I help?
Yeah, so I have a cold, I've been having a cough and a sore throat for about a week, and it's been causing me problems. I've had to stay away from work for about three or four of those days because of how bad it is.
Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. So you've had a cough and a sore throat for about a week. And what came first?
The sore throat came first, and then after a day or two the cough.
Okay, okay. And are you coughing up anything?
No, it's very dry.
Okay. So I'm just going to ask a few questions about your current symptoms and then a little bit about your background, and something else about what we can do a little bit later on in the consultation to help you. But before I go on, anything you're particularly concerned about or have any ideas what might be going on, you said you had a cold.
Well, I mean you know how we all are, once this happens you Google it and there seems to be all kinds of bad things it could be. It could be a cold or flu obviously, but it could be tuberculosis, it could be cancer, always comes up, so it would be good if none of those.
Right, so yeah, I can provide a little bit of reassurance and we can talk about those a little bit as well. And was there anything you're particularly expecting or hoping to get out of this consultation?
Well, yeah, so reassurance, so like hopefully some sense that it's not anything too serious, but also if there's anything you can prescribe me to make it better, or any advice, or maybe even a sick note so if I need to stay away from work for a bit longer I can get one.
Sure, sure. Okay. Alright, so we'll talk a little bit about the symptoms and I'm sure we can give those things, the sick note and some reassurance about your concerns. So, you mentioned that you started with a sore throat about a week ago, developed into a bit of a dry cough.
Yep.
I'll just ask a few questions around those. So do you have any shortness of breath?
Yes, yes, I've been having shortness of breath.
You are short of breath. And do you have any wheeze or chest pain?
Yeah, a bit of both actually.
You're feeling a bit wheezy with some chest pain as well.
Yes.
Okay. And how when did you start to develop the shortness of breath?
I think so, so the sore throat, so today is Friday, sore throat was about last week Friday or Thursday, cough was Saturday, Sunday, so the shortness of breath I think shortly after the cough, so maybe a day or two later, so three or four days ago.
Three or four days ago you started developing... And is the cough worse at nighttime?
No, it's the same throughout the day.
Same throughout the day. And when you say you're short of breath, just need to try and get an idea about how short of breath you are, so are you able to walk up a flight of stairs, for example, or are you short of breath at rest?
Oh yeah, it's like when I'm doing walking, and I do exercise now and then, so it hasn't been super bad, like hasn't stopped me from doing any of those things, but it's been pretty unusual and a little bit worried.
And you're a bit concerned about that. Okay. So I just need to ask a few things about your background as well. So do you have any other medical conditions or medical history?
No, no past medical history, no.
No past medical history. No history of asthma?
No.
And any history of clots on your legs or your lungs? So these DVTs or PEs. No one in your family has had those? Clots on the legs or the lungs?
Well, my mother had lung cancer.
Your mother had lung cancer. Do you smoke?
No.
Have you ever smoked or been exposed to asbestos that you know of?
Don't know what asbestos, ever smoked, I mean once or twice in Amsterdam, that kind of stuff, but not really.
Okay. And this so just going back to your symptoms of shortness of breath with the cough, it's a dry cough, no you're not coughing up any phlegm. Do you have and you say you don't have any chest pain as such? Are you taking any medications currently at the moment?
No, I'm not.
Okay. Are you allergic to any medications?
Not to any medication, but I'm allergic to peanuts.
Peanuts, okay. And you mentioned that your mother had lung cancer. Any other family history of any significant illnesses running in your family?
No, no, that's the only one, just lung cancer from my mother.
Just lung cancer. Okay. And you say you have a cold, so do you have sinus congestion or...
No, it seems to be all entirely with just my throat, so like my nose isn't runny or...
Just your throat. And any recent travel, or have you always lived in the UK?
No, so I haven't always lived in the UK, like so I was born in the US and moved over about 12 years ago, but in terms of recent travel, just to Europe, nowhere too exotic.
Okay, so no significant recent travel anywhere. Okay. And are you coughing up anything other than you're not coughing up blood or anything like that?
No.
Good. And are you feeling feverish, hot, cold, sweaty?
Yeah, so a little bit feverish at first, so the first three or so days of this, but then the fever's gone away.
Okay. And in general do you feel...
Yeah, I was just going to say also had a bit of a headache at first, headaches that come and go rather but right now it's fine.
Okay. And in general would you say you're beginning to feel better, worse or staying the same?
So it's like it's up and down. So, let's see, so I started last week and I stayed home from work two days this week, I think it was maybe Tuesday and then Thursday, so like I felt better and then worse again and then better and then worse again, so it's been yeah kind of constant, but constant in being variable, if that makes sense.
Okay. And I just need to ask any other risk factors that you may have. So no sort of significant weight loss or unexplained weight loss? Any worries?
No weight loss, but I have been losing my appetite recently, and I mean I usually eat a lot and I enjoy eating as well, but like that's been a bit concerning.
You've been losing your appetite recently?
Yeah.
And you're a little bit concerned about that. But you haven't lost any weight that you think of?
No, not that I'm aware.
And any sort of rashes or anything?
No rashes.
Not that you can think of. Okay. So I would ask to examine you now, but I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat at least to see if there's any...
We can try it.
Oh no, well, no, it's okay, I might think about doing that. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck that you can feel?
No.
Not that you... no, okay. And so finally you were talking about I mean it sounds to me that you've been a little bit up and down, sore throat, developed a dry cough, you are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of the consultation now, is if you feel significantly worse, if you get more short of breath or sudden change in your breathlessness, or breathlessness that you are concerned about, then I would advise you to seek medical attention again, see a GP, and actually see somebody physically. But I think for now I can sort of try and reassure you that if this clears up as I expect it would, so I'd expect this to sort of be getting better in the next four or five days. If it's not, please get in touch with a medical professional again. And I'd expect it to, and so therefore I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis. Your concerns about lung cancer are, was that the other thing you were concerned about?
Oh yeah, yeah.
Yeah. So again if you're not getting better, please see somebody again. I've just got four seconds now, so nice talking to you and and we gotta tidy up, yeah. Okay. So and I'll provide you with a sick note just to give you a few more days off work, and paracetamol, lots of fluids, and rest up, and as I say, if you're not feeling better please get in touch. Okay?
Alright, thanks a lot. Have a good day.
Thank you.
Alright.
