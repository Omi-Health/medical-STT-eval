Hello. Hello. Hi. How you doing? Hi, good thank you. How are you? Fine thanks, yeah. I'm Joe, I'm one of the doctors at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name please? Of course, um, my name's Lizzie Irvine, and, um, 23rd of July 1995. Great, thank you Lizzie. And are you in a confidential and comfortable space to talk? Yeah, especially on a Friday. Comfortable. Great. Um, how can I help? Yeah, just for the last couple of days, um, I've been feeling, um, really sick in my lower tummy, and I've had a bit of a temperature so feeling quite like hot and sweaty and it's yeah getting really uncomfortable. Okay. So you've been feeling nauseous and you've had some pain in your lower tummy or you say you've been feeling sick in your lower tummy? Yeah, it's more of an ache, so like an ache in my lower tummy. Okay, and then like because feeling hot and sweaty sometimes think it's sickness but yeah bit of an ache. Okay. So it's feeling hot, sweaty, unwell for three days, feeling sick, nausea, um, with an ache in your lower tummy. Any actual vomiting? Um, so yeah no, just nausea, no vomiting yeah luckily, and it's only been for a couple of days but yeah. Two days, yeah. Okay. Um, and any problems with your waterworks or diarrhea? No, so I'm, I'm going to the loo a little bit more often than usual, um, drink I drink lots of water but it does feel like more often. Um, yeah like nothing nothing too out of the ordinary, um, and I was I was a little bit like, um, I don't know, constipated I guess about a week ago but I'm okay now. Okay. So you've been a bit constipated a week ago. Uh things are you having regular bowel motions now? You said you had a bit of diarrhea or a bit of watery, did you say? No, it was more like I was just a little bit bunged up and then about a week ago that kind of cleared and I'm normal now. Okay. And you're saying you're drinking lots of water and you're going to the toilet more frequently for a wee, is that? Yes, yeah I'd say so. I I tend to drink a lot of water anyway but I feel like I'm going to the toilet more. Mm. Any pain when you pass urine? Um, no, no pain. No stinging? Uh no, just seems normal yeah. Okay. And um and sort of no foul-smelling urine or anything like that? Um, no, nothing nothing I can think of no. You having you say you're going a bit more frequently. Are you having to go with urgency to the toilet, a wee? No, there's no urgency. Um, yeah no pain or urgency. Just yeah, peeing quite frequently but it's all seeming normal. Yeah I probably wouldn't have thought of it being linked but yeah. Okay. All right. So the main symptom is feeling sick uh with this you've been feeling bunged up and this this sort of pain in your tummy. Just to ask a few more questions about the pain in your tummy, is it how would you describe the pain? Um, it's yeah it's like below my belly button. Um, it's it's aching, um, it does make me feel nauseous. Um, yeah so it's kind of more like I guess like an a dull ache just below the belly button kind of yeah here. Um, and it's is it constant or is it coming and going? Um, it's yeah it's feeling pretty constant over the last couple of days. Mm. And just need to ask a few questions about your periods and stuff. Any chance you could be pregnant at the moment? Um, oh I don't know. Um, probably not, I don't think so. I'm very careful. You're being sexually active at the moment? Yes, yeah. And you mentioned about periods, I did notice a bit of, I don't know, it's like not necessarily like spotting, but like in my in my pee is like a little I suppose I think I thought it was my period, it's like a little bit pink. In your pee did you say? So your pee is slightly red or slightly pink? Yeah, but I am kind of like due on my so I didn't know if that was like yeah part of it. Okay. So when was your last menstrual period? Um, around a month ago yeah, three and a three and a bit weeks ago. Uh okay. Um so three-four. And um did you say you're sexually active? Are you using contraception and what? Mm-hmm, yeah. I've got the um the implant. Um and uh one sexual partner, uh regular regular boyfriend? Yeah. So just to go back to your symptom of constipation, can I just clarify when was the last time you had a bowel motion? Uh yesterday. Okay. And uh do you feel like you are still quite bunged up at the moment? Um no, it seems to have cleared up so I was about a week ago but I'm okay okay now the last few days. Yeah, it's been okay. Okay. All right. So you just to sort of confirm your symptoms, um, you're feeling sort of sick, nauseous with tummy pain which is fairly constant. Um, how did the tummy pain come on suddenly or gradually? Um, it's only been for the last two days. Um, so I guess yeah quite recently. So it's it's come on gradually is it? Yeah. Not sudden onset. Okay. And your last menstrual period was just three and a bit weeks ago, um and but you say you've had some a little bit of spotting possibly before in between periods or recently? Yeah the last kind of week or so. Yeah the last couple of days really but because I was due on yeah I think yeah just the last couple of days. Okay. But you're expecting your period soon? Yes, yeah. Sure. Okay and just to ask a few questions, are you uh do you have any other medical uh problems uh I need to be aware of? Um, and I'm allergic to amoxicillin. Allergic to amoxicillin. Um, but no other medical problems that you? No, not that I'm aware of. Any drug allergies? Oh you mentioned the amoxicillin but anything else? No, that's it. Um, and do you take any medications at the moment? Um, no no medications but I'm on the implant, I think it's called um Implanon. Implanon, yeah sure. Okay. Uh do you smoke? No. Okay. And uh do you live with alone, with your partner? With my boyfriend. With my boyfriend. And uh any other medical sorry any uh diseases running in your family? Um, not anything that springs to mind in my immediate family. Um my brother is a type 1 diabetic. Sure. Okay. Okay great. So um is there anything that you're particularly concerned about with um this sort of nausea and uh the constipation? Um I don't know, it's just a really like really horrible ache. Um and hot nauseous hot sweaty feeling I'm not really sure why yeah why it's happening. Um the last couple of days that's probably all that's yeah getting uncomfortable. Yeah. Anything that you'd hoped particularly to get out of having this consultation? Anything sorry? Was there anything that you had hoped to get out of having this specific consultation other than a diagnosis and getting better and you know being on the right track to to feeling better? Yeah no that's kind of I just want to um get back to a bit more comfortably. Yeah sure sure. Okay um so and then finally I I didn't ask you do you have any discharge or anything like that from down below? Um no no no discharge. No discharge. Okay. All right. So um I I think um this could be a few different things it could be just simple constipation you mentioned that you were bunged up but you did go yesterday so it's um and your bowel habits you've been going regularly um but you did mention that you were bunged up. Um but there could be a few other things going on. I would quite like to uh see you to do some further to do an examination and to do some some tests as well. Um we need to definitely rule out pregnancy with you and possibly uh do some other examinations or sort further tests. So would you be happy to actually see a GP face-to-face um soon today ideally? Um yes yeah sure I feel like I can make time. Yeah. And you're feeling hot hot and sweaty. Have you been feeling uh lightheaded at all or like you're going to faint? No no not like I'm going to faint. Okay. All right well we're just sort of tying up running out of time a little bit but um I'd really like to see you uh for some more uh examination and investigations. If in the meantime between now and and me or or a GP seeing you you feel worse in any way you get lightheaded um you uh you have you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you um then I think take them quite seriously and and see somebody more urgently if possible. Um okay is that was there anything else that you want to talk about right now? I'm glad we've got the ball rolling with this and uh we can um sort of see you again to take this a little bit further. Is that okay? Yeah thank you really appreciate that. Okay. All right thanks for your time. Cool. Okay. Bye. Cheers. Thanks. Bye.
