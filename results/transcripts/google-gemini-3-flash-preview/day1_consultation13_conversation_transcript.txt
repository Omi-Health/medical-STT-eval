Hello?
Hi there.
Hello there. Thanks for being here. Before we go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please?
Yes, it’s Adriana Katringieva, and I’m 26 years old.
Okay, Adriana, and how can I help you this afternoon?
Well, I have this, like, really crazy headache that’s been going on for a few days, and it really annoys me.
Oh dear. Okay. When, when did it exactly start, this headache?
Around three days ago, maybe?
Three days ago. Okay. And whereabouts in your head is this pain?
It’s basically like, it kind of feels all over my head, but like, mainly around my right eye.
Around your right eye. Okay. And is that headache there all the time, or does it come and go?
It kind of comes and goes, but I mean, it is there all the time, but like, sometimes it’s stronger.
Okay, so it comes and goes. Okay. And if I was to ask you on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst type of pain you’ve ever had, how would you rate this headache?
It’s probably an eight.
Eight. And if I was to ask you to describe the headache to me, in terms of the nature of the pain, is it sharp, is it dull, is it crampy, is it throbbing?
It’s kind of, it’s dull, but sometimes it gets a bit sharper. So basically, it like, it developed gradually, I guess. It’s like, the first day, it just started when I was at work, and by the end of the day, it was like, pretty, pretty, like, it was a lot basically, and then I was thinking, okay, maybe I’ll just go to sleep, and then I woke up the next morning, like, it was even, even worse basically.
So you think the headache is getting worse over the last three days?
Yeah.
Okay. Have you tried anything which has made the headache better?
Um, so I tried ibuprofen. So I took like a few for the last two days basically, but it doesn’t really help, no. In the past, it did help me, which is why I decided to try it, but...
Okay, alright. And except the headache, any other symptoms at all? So, for example, any problems with your eyesight or your vision?
Not really, but just when it started, I got these like weird shooting lights, and like, now like light is quite annoying my eyes.
So when you say annoying, does it hurt to look at bright lights?
Yeah, yeah, it hurts so...
Okay. And have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision?
Not loss of vision, I wouldn’t say, it’s just like some lights... shooting lights basically.
Any nausea or any vomiting?
Um, well I’m like basically, I’m sick with the headache, but I... no vomiting.
When you say sick you mean you feel sick, okay. Yeah. No vomiting, okay. Any neck pain or neck stiffness?
No.
Okay. And any difficulty with speaking or speech?
No.
Any difficulty with weakness in your arms and legs?
No, it’s hard to focus though, so I had to take a couple of days off work actually.
Oh really? Okay. Okay, no problem, well I’ll ask you a bit more about your work later on. Any recent head injuries at all?
No.
Okay. And have you had anything like this before in the past?
Yeah, I mean, headaches, you mean?
Or similar to this kind of headache.
Yeah, I mean, I have, but usually after I take ibuprofen, it kind of goes away, so but this time it’s just not.
It’s just not, okay. No worries. Any temperatures or fevers?
No.
Any rashes at all on your skin?
No, not that I’ve noticed.
Okay. And just moving forwards, are you otherwise fit and well, Adriana?
Am I what, sorry?
Fit and well? Do you have any other medical history?
Yeah, I think so. It’s just the headache.
Any history of migraines at all?
Not myself, I’ve never had a migraine, but my sister and my mum have them quite frequently.
Okay, fine. I’ll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask, do you take any regular medication?
No.
Are you on the pill?
No.
Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
Not that I know of.
Okay. So you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines?
Yeah.
Are they, is that normally well-controlled, or are they having difficulty controlling the symptoms?
Um, so my sister’s like better, like it’s kind of very rare, but my mum’s is like quite bad. Um, usually when there’s like a season changing and stuff like that, it yeah, takes her out for a few days basically.
Alright, okay. Fine. Socially, tell me a bit more about your life outside of work. So who lives at home with you?
I live with housemates, so three of them, so we’re four basically.
Excellent. And are you working at the moment? You mentioned it’s impacting on your work.
Yes, so I work, well, I work in IT so I work with computers a lot, so it kind of is difficult to focus. I had to like reduce the brightness of my screen.
Okay. Do you wear glasses?
Yes, I do.
Have you had any recent eye check done, eye test?
No, I’ve been wearing them since I was five, five years old, so...
Okay, alright. Something to bear in mind if you feel like your eyes are straining, I always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Have you been feeling more stressed or anxious at work recently?
Well, it’s been a bit stressful kicking off a new project, but um, yeah, nothing out of the ordinary really.
Okay, alright. Great. Regarding smoking or alcohol, do you drink or smoke at all?
I socially smoke, and I drink not only socially.
So only socially, okay. Right. Now Adriana, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Have you read anything online or spoken to people?
Um, not really. I first I thought it’s stress, or maybe I didn’t drink enough water because sometimes when I don’t drink enough water I like get headaches. Um, but I don’t think that’s it. And I’m like worried, I don’t want it to be a migraine because I know what it’s like from my mum and my sister, and it’s really annoying, so I really don’t want to have that, and I know it’s genetic so I’ve researched that, um, but I don’t know if that is the case, so yeah.
Okay. Is there anything in particular you were hoping that I could do for you today?
Yeah, maybe just kind of if you have any recommendations if I can take something stronger because apparently ibuprofen doesn’t help me. Um, usually it gets resolved if I have headache in like after like one or two days, but currently it didn’t help me.
How many tablets did you take of ibuprofen?
Three a day.
Three a day, okay. Alright. So Adriana, so really what I think is going on here, I unfortunately do think this could be a headache very similar to a migraine. The reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it given your mum and your sister also have migraines, I think it’s something for us to think about. Um, now I’m not saying it’s going to keep happening, but it might just be a one-off, but it’s certainly worth treating it today with some stronger analgesia or painkillers. Um, now moving forwards we have some options which we can discuss. You tried the ibuprofen, now my only worry is I’m not sure whether you’re taking the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets three times a day.
Alright.
So there’s definitely room for improvement there, or I can prescribe you something stronger like naproxen, which is another anti-inflammatory which can be helpful. We can also add in other painkillers like paracetamol or codeine, which might be helpful as well.
Yeah, I think codeine is what my mum takes for when she has migraines.
Okay. So I think it’s certainly worth looking into that, so I can give you a prescription for that today. With regards to the next few days, it may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what’s if there’s any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse. And you know, I’d like you to come back and see me in about a week’s time, week to two weeks’ time, if you are having more frequent episodes of these type of headaches we can think about giving you medications as prophylactic, which basically means medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis, but we can have that discussion next time.
Okay.
In the meantime, if your headaches aren’t getting any better or they’re getting worse, um, you know, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me sooner, okay?
Okay.
If you have any problems with your vision or weakness in your arms and legs or you’re just not feeling very well, just give me a call and come back and see me.
Okay.
Great, well have a good day.
Thank you, you too. Bye.
Bye.
