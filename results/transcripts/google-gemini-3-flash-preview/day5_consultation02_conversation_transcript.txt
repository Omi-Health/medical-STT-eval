Okay, are you in a private place so you can have a consultation today?
Yes, I am.
Okay, what can I do for you?
It hurts when I pee.
Okay, and how long has that been going on for?
Six days now.
Pardon?
For six days.
Six days, okay. And just tell me a bit more about that. How did it start?
Um, I've got this thing when I pee and it hurts when I go to the loo and I've got this very unpleasant smell that comes out.
Okay, and have you had any other symptoms along with that? Have you had any abdominal pain or lower back pain at all?
I've got pain in my tummy.
Whereabouts?
In my lower tummy.
Okay, is it one-sided or in the middle?
In the middle.
And how bad would you say that is on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain?
Seven.
And is it constant or does it come and go?
Comes and goes.
Okay, and have you actually been able to pass water okay?
Yes, but I've had spotted blood in my urine.
Okay, and is that just over the last six days?
Yes.
Right, and have you been able to eat and drink okay?
Yes.
Um, and have you had a temperature? Do you feel like you've been feverish or had a temperature with this?
No, not at all.
And any... you said you didn't have any lower back pain?
No, I've got... and no loin pain as well.
Okay. And have you had these symptoms before?
No.
Never?

And was there anything you were doing recently which you think may have contributed to it? Have you... have you been doing lots of exercise? Been dehydrated? Um, been having regular sexual intercourse or anything?
No.
No. Okay. And any... any other symptoms? Any vaginal discharge or anything like that?
No, just the blood spotting in my...
Okay. Do you have regular periods?
Yes, I do.
Okay.
Um, and in the past, have you had any medical problems at all?
No medical, no.
Have you had any problems with your kidneys or any urine infections?
I had IBS before.

I'm a support worker.
Okay. Do you drink alcohol at all?
Occasionally.
So how much in an average week?
One glass of wine a week.
Okay. Do you smoke?
No.
Okay. Um, it sounds very much like you might have an infection in your urine. Did you say you haven't felt feverish?
No fever at all.
Have you got a thermometer at home?
No.
Okay. It would be helpful if you could get a thermometer from the pharmacy and do check your temperature just to make sure that it isn't going up and down.
Okay.
Um, normally we can treat this infection without having to test your urine, with a course of antibiotics.
Okay.
Um, how would you feel about that? Are you happy to take a course of antibiotics?
Yes, I would be.
It would just be for three days.
Okay.
So how do I get my prescription?
Yes, so I can send a prescription through to your requested pharmacy for that. If you take them as soon as you can, get them picked up as soon as you can and start taking them.
The other thing which is important to do is to drink lots of water, so two and a half to three liters a day.
Um, you can get some cranberry juice and take... drink that as well, that's sometimes helps. And also some sachets... um, which you can get from the chemist, some sachets which just help change the acidity of your urine, so I can put the details of that on your notes.
Okay then.
If you feel like your pain is getting worse or not settling, you get lower back pain, um, or you're getting a high temperature, or you have any problems actually passing urine, then it's very important that we speak to you again.
Okay.
Um, the other thing is if it becomes a common thing or a recurrent problem, then we need to talk to you again about that.
So do I have to call after I finish my course of antibiotics?
No, not if you're better.
Okay.
If you... if you feel like your symptoms get worse at any point or they're not resolving with the treatment or you keep getting a similar... you keep getting a similar problem recurrently, then it's important for us to talk to you in more detail about that.
Okay then.
Um, have you got any other questions?
Uh, no. Well, what would be the pharmacy I'll be picking up my medication from?
Um, so have you already requested a pharmacy through Babylon?
Yes, I did.
Can I just check that with you?
Knightsbridge Practice.
Okay, that's fine. So the antibiotics that I'm going to prescribe um will go through to that pharmacy and you'll be able to pick them up from there.
How soon is that going to be at the practice? In five minutes?
Um, I would give it longer than that. Give it an hour or so.
All right then, thank you. I'll pick that at lunch time.
Okay. All right then.
Thank you.
Take care. Bye.
Bye.
