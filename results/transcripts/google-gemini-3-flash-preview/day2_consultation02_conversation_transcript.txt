Hi there, good morning. Hello, good morning. Um, I'm Dr. Dean Mirza from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Okay. Before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth? Yes, uh, my name is John Smith and I was born on the 5th of April, 1973. Okay, that's great. Thank you for that. Um, are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes, absolutely. Okay, great. Okay. So, um, tell me a bit about what's been happening. You said you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow.

Yeah, um, I just noticed this like about a week ago or something. Um, have like a weird swelling on, on, on my elbow. I noticed that when I was in the shower. Um, it's not painful at all or like, I feel, I feel fine, but it's just, it's just a bit, a bit weird to see that. Um, it's, it's slightly warm, um, and I kind of feel like there's, it's a bit fluid inside or... Sure. Sure. Okay. So I want to know what's going on basically. And so did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow? Um, it's the, the left elbow. Left elbow. Okay. And have you banged that elbow? Did you have any kind of injury? No, not really. Um, not that I know of. I haven't noticed anything. I can actually like move it normally. Um, it's just, I can just see that it feels a bit strange.

Sure. Okay. And, um, in terms of your job, do you do anything physical? Not really, no. I just, you know, sit at a desk. Um, yeah. Right. Okay. And has this happened before? No, no, I haven't noticed that before. Um, I don't have any like history of seeing this. I don't remember at all. Sure. Okay. And can I, um, can I just double-check? Has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that? Um, oh well, I do, well, I think, I think I have something like osteoarthritis. Um, uh, it sometimes kind of hurts my joints. But in my family, I'm not sure. Oh, no. No.

Sure. Okay. So you said you think you've got osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis? Um, yes. Yes, a few years ago. Okay. Was that a GP or a specialist or was it a physiotherapist? A GP. GP. Okay. All right. Um, can I just, sorry, can I just double-check how old you are, please? I'm 53. 53. Okay, fantastic. All right. Um, and do you have any other illnesses at all? Um, well, not, not really, no. Uh, I told you I'm, I'm allergic to peanuts. Um, that's pretty much all I have to say about my medical history. Right. Okay. Are you allergic to any medication? Um, no. Not that I know of.

Sure. And, um, do you, um, are you on any medication on a regular basis? No. No. Okay. And are you normally fit and well, mobile, active? I do, I do do some sports. I run regularly, like two, three times a week. Um, yeah, no, I think I'm healthy. Okay, good. Glad to hear that. Well done. That's good that you're doing that on a regular basis. Okay. Um, and, um, uh, can I, is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now? Uh, yes, sure. Okay, bear with me one second. Right. Okay. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that, a bit higher so I can just see the underside. Okay, fantastic. All right. And then just bring it round to this side centrally. I can see the other side. Okay, fantastic.

All right. And if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers, does it, is it hot compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin? It's a bit warm, yes. It's a bit warmer. Okay. Um, and, um, is it very tender when you're pressing on that now? Does it, if you give it a press, does it hurt you at all? On the, on the tip of the elbow it's okay, it's just like next to it, like where the swelling is, it's a bit, yeah, it feels a bit fluidy. Okay. All right. Um, what, um, I noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow. Do you, do you have dry skin anywhere else on the body? Uh, no, not really. I have normal skin. Not really dry, no. Do you suffer from eczema at all? No.

No. All right. Okay. So, um, what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem, okay, is, um, I think it would be worthwhile. This seems like what we call bursitis, okay? So that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. Um, what I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication in the first instance. And as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of, uh, causes of joint swelling. Okay. So, um, what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some blood test forms to be sent out to your house, and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done. And that will involve you, um, having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies. So we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well.

Okay. The timeframe for that will be the results will come back to us after about five or six days, um, from now. So it takes time for the forms to come out to you, and then if you get the forms and the test done straight away, by the time that we're expecting a result back, in one or two days after that, we're looking at maybe six days. And what I'd suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood tests, and we can, um, get a gauge as to, um, what's going on.

Now, in terms of your joint right now, it doesn't look like to me like something called septic arthritis. So we're worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint. Um, and your, your joint doesn't look like that. However, if your, the elbow was to become very red, very painful, and the redness was to spread or become, you know, more intense, then you need to get on the phone or get have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible, because that would be an emergency, that would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment. Okay?

Right. Do you think it's something dangerous, like something, like could I die from that or is it...? No. I don't think this is anything dangerous. You don't need to worry. Okay. What I'm doing is I'm just outlining the worst-case scenario if things were to, to develop, okay? So if things were to worsen, this is not the case right now. Right now it looks quite straightforward, it's nothing sinister or life-threatening. Um, what I'm doing is I'm just saying in case things worsen, these are the things that we'll be looking out for and this is what you'll have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully, and I don't think you're going to have it, but I'm just saying the what-if scenario. Is that okay? Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.

All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me? Um, well, just yeah, I just wanted to know about this. Um, yeah, it feels a bit better now to know that. But other than that, that's it. Thank you. Okay. So I would take ibuprofen regularly. Okay. You can get that over the counter. Um, that's 400 milligrams three times a day. And you should take that after food, not on an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it. Okay? Sure. All right.

Okay. So what I want to do is I'll get the forms sent out to you and, um, we are going to arrange a follow-up appointment, maybe within a, actually, you know, the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face-to-face. If it's more convenient for you to do over the phone, we can do that over the phone or video. We can do that as well. That's your call. But you contact us after you've had the blood test done and we can review things then. Okay? Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. I, I'll do that and if I see that it's getting worse, I'll probably ask for a physical appointment, but... Sure. Sure, that's a good idea. All right then. Okay. Take care then. So I'll just leave that with me, I'll sort all those bits and pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll, we'll review you after the tests. Thanks a lot. Okay. Sure. All right then. Take care then. All the best. Bye-bye. Bye.
