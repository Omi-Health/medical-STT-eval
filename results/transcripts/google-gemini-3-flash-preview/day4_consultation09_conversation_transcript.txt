Hello? Oh, hello. Hi. Hi, how are you doing? My name is Joe, I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? Yeah, sure, it's Daniel Brown. Hi, Daniel. And your date of birth? Yeah, May 11th, 1992. 92. Okay, Daniel. And are you in a comfortable and confidential place to talk? Yeah, totally. Happy to go ahead. Great, how can I help? Um, yeah, I just, my chest has been feeling really tight. Okay, and how long has this been going on for, Daniel? Uh, for about three hours now. Okay, so tight chest for three hours, and so you're born in 92 so that makes you 26. 26, yeah. And you're any shortness of breath at all with that? Yeah, like a little bit. Um, yeah, a little bit short of breath, not too bad. Any cough, wheeze? Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well, and this coughing, coughing, yeah. Light cough, yeah. Any sore throat, runny nose, sore ears? You know, I had a cold last week and it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose, I was just feeling under the weather. Are you feeling better now other than the tight chest? I mean, I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore. Right, okay, okay, but you now you've got this, so you've still got symptoms of a cold essentially. Yeah, the cough's kind of stuck around. Ah, yeah, okay. And are you coughing up anything? Uh, no. And do you have any other medical problems like asthma? Yeah, yeah, I have asthma, I've had it for a while now. And then I have like hay fever, you know, some allergies to dust and that. Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any medications? Um, yeah, so you know the Ventolin, it's called Salbutamol. Yeah. I got that one and then I have a steroid, Clenil, Clenil inhaler. Clenil Modulate, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. And have you been using Clenil and the Ventolin and how often have you been using them? Um, well to be honest, I was away at uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me, so I haven't really in the past week. Both of them? Because, because, sorry, they ran out and I forgot to go and grab the next one about a week ago. Yeah, sure. Okay. All right, so you haven't got any Clenil or any Ventolin at the moment. Not with me right now, no, I ran out. Okay. All right. Any drug allergies that you know of? No, no allergy to anything. Just like the dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs. Okay, great. Now, anyone in your family had any medical problems that you know of? Um, yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Oh, and when I was young, I also had eczema and I had a milk protein allergy when I was young, too. Okay. Great. So just, do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or hopes for this consultation? Um, not really, like I feel like asthma's probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers would be helpful. It's just kind of scary because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight in a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I can imagine. Um, well, it certainly sounds like you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough and it's non-productive cough and you're short of breath. Is the cough worse at nighttime? I mean, it gets a little bit worse at night, but basically just pretty consistent and hasn't gone away. Yeah, okay. And you've got this tight chest, but you wouldn't say you've got chest pain, just more a tight chest, is that right? No, not really pain, it's more like tight. It just feels like sometimes I can't get a full breath in, you know? Yeah, sure. Um, okay, well I would quite like to certainly get you some Ventolin, Clenil Modulate. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young a little bit more, like back in high school, but I've been pretty good at taking my inhalers, so not so much anymore. Have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient, as in, you know, stayed in there overnight for asthma? Yeah, when I was in high school I had to have a tube put down my throat. Oh, okay. So you went to hospital and had a, so you stayed in hospital for a few days did you, with an asthma exacerbation? Yeah, I did, yeah. Okay, but currently you're just on Ventolin and Clenil and you haven't got any of those, those inhalers at the moment. Yeah, I've been pretty good, I've been pretty good just on the Clenil and the Salbutamol. Okay. And when, sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation? Um, I think I was like 17, 16 maybe. Sure. Okay. Just to quantify how short of breath you are, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you, no, you won't have, will you? Are you able to like walk up flights of stairs okay, walk on the flat okay, without getting too short of breath, or are you short of breath at rest? Um, I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like except for that feeling I was describing. It does when I'm walking upstairs, I do feel like I have a little bit more shorter breath than I would normally be. Sure. Yeah, okay, but you're not short of breath at rest at the moment. No, no, I'm not. Okay, fine. So what I think, and just to go over, is there anything you had hoped about getting other than a prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else that you had hoped about getting from this consultation? Well, I just want to know that I'm okay to just keep, I just don't want to have to get that, that intubation again. Sure, yeah, no, absolutely. Well, I'm really glad that you've talked to me today. I think what we can do is give you a prescription for some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within the hour I would hope, and I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So this is, these are tablets which you can take for five days, two tablets in the morning and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response, okay? Okay. Now there are some side effects to the steroids which I should really tell you about, but please read the label associated. Don't be too worried about the side effects, they're uncommon, most, you know, most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated and you probably, have you had them in the past do you know of? Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Have you had steroids in the past? Um, I can't remember. Probably. Probably, yeah, I would have thought so too. So they can come, they can make your mood change, it can be slightly low or slightly high. They can give you a high blood sugar and they can also cause rash, nausea, headaches, but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help your asthma an awful lot. What I'd like to do is send you these, the prescriptions for your inhalers ongoing, so you can once you get better from this asthma attack you can use the Clenil Modulate in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN, so a Ventolin when you need to when you're getting wheezy. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than every three hours at any time, it's a good idea to seek medical attention, so see a doctor in some capacity. And the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer which will allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Have you, do you know what a spacer is, have you used one before? Yeah, yeah, somebody told me how to use one a while ago. I don't really use it to be honest, but. Have you got one? I think I do, I have one somewhere. Okay. Well, I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially a couple of puffs to prime it inside, breathing in and out for five or ten breaths. Okay. And yeah, so was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage? I think you got me covered. Okay. And I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're okay with doing that. Yeah, definitely. Alright. Alrighty, well thank you very much. No worries, any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath, or just generally concerning symptoms, pain in your chest, tightness, feeling lightheaded, then seek further medical attention anytime, please. Okay? Alright, sounds good. Okay, thank you. Great, thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
