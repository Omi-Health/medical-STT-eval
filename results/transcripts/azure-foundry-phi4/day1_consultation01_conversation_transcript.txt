Hello? Hello, how are you? Hi, should you stop? Yeah, okay. Hello, good morning, how can I help you this morning? Hi, I've just had some diarrhea for the last three days and it's been affecting me. I need to stay close to the toilet and yeah it's been affecting my day to day activities. Sorry to hear that. And when you say diarrhea, what do you mean by diarrhea? Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often or are your stools more loose? Yeah so it's like loose and watery stool, going to the toilet quite often, and like some pain in my lower stomach. Okay, and how many times a day are you going, let's say, over the last couple of days? Probably like six, seven times a day. Six, seven times a day. And you mentioned it's mainly watery. Have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools? No, no blood, yeah, just watery and loose stool. Okay, and you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well? Yep. Whereabouts is the pain exactly? So it's like in my lower abdomen, so like, yeah, just to one side. One side, and what side is that? On the left side. Left side, okay. And can you describe the pain to me? Yeah, it feels like a cramp, like a muscular cramp, and yeah, I feel a bit weak and shaky. Okay, and does the pain, is it there all the time or does it come and go? It comes and goes. Does the pain move anywhere else besides towards your back? No just mainly in my stomach. Okay fine. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well. What do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been having, are you feeling feverish for example? Yeah, it doesn't feel like, yeah, I just make me feel weak. I haven't had a fever at the moment, but I did notice a temperature when the symptoms started, so yeah, around about three or four days ago. You measure your temperature then? Yeah, I didn't measure my temperature, no, but I felt just a bit hot. Okay, okay. Any other symptoms like sweating or light? No. No. And any vomiting at all? Yeah, so I vomited at the start of the symptoms, but now I've stopped vomiting. You stopped vomiting, okay. And was your vomit, I know it's not a nice thing to talk about, but was it just normal food color? Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit. Yeah. And there was no blood in your vomit, is that right? No blood, no. No, okay. And any other symptoms at all? You mentioned tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhoea, you mentioned your vomiting. Anything else that comes to mind? I had a loss of appetite, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids. Okay, so you're drinking fluids. What kind of foods have you managed to eat anything? Just soups and light foods like smoothies and liquid foods mainly. Okay, fine. And so these started three days ago to symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused your symptoms to kick on? So, for example, things like take away foods or eating out or being around other people who have similar symptoms? Yeah, so I had take away about four days ago. But other than that I've been eating normally. I think it's unusual. Do you remember where you ate? I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Anyone else on well with similar symptoms? So no one else in the family, so wife and two kids and one child was vomiting but they haven't got diarrhea, it's no one with the same symptoms. Okay, okay, fine. Right, and in terms of your overall health, are you normally fitting well or? Yeah, I mean other than asthma, use an inhaler, everything else is fine. Okay, and is your asthma well controlled? Yeah, that's fine, just use an inhaler and that's under control. And you don't have any other tummy problem, bowel problems I should be aware of? No. No, okay. And apart from inhalers, do you take any other medications? No, no other medications. Okay, fine. And in terms of just your day-to-day life, you said it's been affecting your life. In what way has it been affecting your life? So I need to stay close to the toilet because I go quite frequently during these past three days. Other than that, it's the main concern. And are you currently working at the moment? Yes, I work. I'm an accountant. Okay, have you been going to work the last three days or have you been at home? Yeah, I've been going to work. That must be difficult for you then. Yeah, it's been quite difficult. And you said you live with a wife and two children, is that right? Yes, yeah. All right, just a couple of other questions we need to ask. Do you smoke at all? No, I don't smoke. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No, I don't drink alcohol, no. Okay, so normally at this stage I like to examine you if that's okay, but having listened to your stories, I think, just to recap, for the last three days you've been having loose stool, diarrhoea, a bit of tummy pain mainly on the left hand side, vomiting and feeling quite weak and lethargic. You mentioned you were having this Chinese takeaway as well three days ago and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. Okay. It seems like you may have something called gastroenteritis. Which essentially is just a tummy bug or infection of your tummy. Mainly caused by viruses but there can be a possibility of bacteria causing symptoms. At this stage, what we recommend is just what we say conservative management. So I don't think you need anything like antibiotics, it's really just making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids. There are things like Dyralite you can get from the pharmacy, which helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. Okay. And if you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would say recommend that the first couple of days if you are feeling feverish and weak taking some paracetamol two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help I would certainly advise you to take some time off work actually I know you're quite keen to work I would say next two to three days, as the infection clears from your system, take some time off and rest. If your symptoms haven't got better in three to four days, I'd like to come back and see you again. Okay, sure. Because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether there's something else causing and we may need to do further tests, like taking a sample of your stool so we can test that, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, sure, yeah. How's that sound? That sounds great, yeah, yeah. Do you have any questions for me? No, no further questions, no? Is the treatment plan clear? Yeah, that's very clear, thank you. Great, well I wish you all the best. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Bye.
