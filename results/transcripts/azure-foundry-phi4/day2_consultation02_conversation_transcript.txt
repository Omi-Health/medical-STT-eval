Hi there, good morning. I'm Dr. Dean Mizer from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. Hello, good morning. I'm Dr. Dean Mizer from GP at Hand. Nice to see you. Okay, before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth? Yes, my name is John Smith and I was born on the 5th of April 1973. Okay, that's great. Thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak freely? Yes, absolutely. Okay, great. Okay, so tell me a bit about what's been happening. You said you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow. Yeah, I just noticed this like about a week ago or something. I have like a weird swelling on my elbow. I noticed that when I was in the shower. It's not painful at all. I feel fine, but it's just a bit weird to see that. It's slightly warm and I kind of feel like this, it's a bit fluid inside. So I want to know what's going on. Did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow? It's the left elbow. Left elbow, okay. And have you banged that elbow? Did you have any kind of injury? No, not really. Not that I know of. I haven't noticed anything. I can actually, like, move it normally. It's just, I can just see that it feels a bit strange. Sure, okay. And in terms of your job, do you do anything physical? Not really, no, I just sit at the desk. Right. Okay. And has this happened before? No, no, I haven't noticed that before. I don't have any like history of seeing this. I don't remember. Sure. Okay. And can I just double check, has anyone in your family got any kind of rheumatology diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or anything like that? No, well I do, well I think I have something like osteoarthritis. It sometimes kind of hurts my joints, but in my family I'm not sure. Okay, no, no. Sure. So you said you think you've got osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that and told you you've got osteoarthritis? Yes, yes, a few years ago. Okay, was that a GP or a specialist or a physiotherapist? A GP. GP, okay, all right. Sorry, can I just double check how old you are, please? I'm 53. 53, okay, fantastic, all right. And do you have any other illnesses at all? Well, not really, you know, so true, I'm allergic to peanuts. That's pretty personal, I had to say, but my medical, are you allergic to any medication? No. Are you on any medication on a regular basis? No. Are you normally fit and well, mobile, active? I do. I do. I do some sports. I run regularly, like two or three times a week. Yeah, I know, I think I'm healthy. Okay, good, glad to hear that. Well done, that's good that you're doing that on a regular basis. Okay, and is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow now? Yes, sure. Okay, bear with me one second. Right, okay. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that, a bit higher so I can just see the underside. Okay, fantastic. All right. And then just bring it round to this side essentially, I can see the other side. Okay, fantastic. All right. And then just bring it around to this side essentially. I can see the other side. Okay, fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers, is it hot compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin? It's a bit warm, yes. It's a bit warmer, okay. And is it very tender when you're pressing on that now? If you give it a press, does it hurt you at all? On the on the tip of the elbow, it's it's okay, just like next to it, like where the the swelling is, it's a bit, yeah, it feels a bit fluid. Okay, all right. Well, I noticed the skin was a bit dry on the tip of the elbow. Do you have dry skin anywhere else in the body? No, not really. I have no more skin. Do you suffer from eczema at all? No. No, all right. Okay, so what I think we should do with regards to your elbow problem, okay, is I think it would be worthwhile. This seems like what we call the bursitis, okay? So that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint. What I think we should do is I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication in the first instance. And as well as that, what I would like to do is to get some blood tests done to check for other types of causes of joint swelling. Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to arrange some blood test forms to be sent out to your house and there'll be instructions within that pack about where to go to get those blood tests done. And that will involve you having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies. So we'll do a full screen and also check for things like gout as well. Okay? Okay. The time frame for that will be, the results will come back to us after about five, six days from now. It takes time for the forms to come out to you and if you get the test done straight away, by the time that we're expecting a result back, one or two days after that, we're looking at maybe six days. And what I'd suggest is we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you in one of our clinics where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood tests and we can get a gauge as to what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now, it doesn't look like to me like something called septic arthritis. So we are worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint. And your joint doesn't look like that. However, if the elbow was to become very red, very painful, and the redness was to spread or become more intense, then you need to get on the phone or have a video appointment with one of us as soon as possible. Because that would be an emergency that would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment. Okay? Do you think it's something dangerous, like something, could I die from that or is it? No, I don't think this is anything dangerous. Don't need to worry, okay? What I'm doing is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to develop. So if things were to worsen, this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward. Nothing's sinister or life-threatening. What I'm doing is I'm just saying, in case things worsen, these are the things that we'll be looking out for and this is what you have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully. And I don't think you're going to have it. But I'm just At the end of that, thank you. Okay, so I would take ibuprofen regularly, okay? You can get that over the counter. That's 400 milligrams, two times a day. And you should take that after food, not on an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it, okay? Sure. All right. So what I want to do is I'll get the form sent out to you and we are going to arrange a follow-up appointment, maybe within a, actually, you know, the follow-up doesn't have to be face-to-face. If it's more convenient for you to do it over the phone, we can do that over the phone, over video, we can do that as well. That's your call, but you contact us after you've had the blood test done and we can review things then. Okay? Okay, yeah, that sounds good. I'll do that. If I see that it's getting worse, I'll probably ask for a physical appointment. Sure, sure, that's good. Alright then, okay, and take care then. So, just leave that with me, I'll sort out those bits and pieces out and then we'll get them sent out to you and then we'll, we'll review you after the test if things go well. Alright, alright, take care then. All the best. Bye bye. Bye.
