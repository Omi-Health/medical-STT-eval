Okay, right here. So, you've mentioned you've got a history of eczema, so what do you do about it? How do you keep it under control? Yeah, usually I use a cream called Depo-Bas. In the shower I use something called Dermol. Dermol, alright. And have you been using them recently or not? Yes, yes, I use them. Use them every day? Yes, I, there's no change in that. I didn't change anything. Okay. Have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema? I'm not sure. Yes, I have used it. But it's not helping. You are still using the steroids. Yes, I tried. Which one are you using, the steroids? What's the name? I'm not sure. It's the box is not there. Okay, so is it like the over the counter ones? Sorry? Over the counter hydrocortisone. Does that ring a bell? Yeah, so you're using the hydrocortisone, yeah? Are you using any antihistamines at all? No. No antihistamines, okay. Right, fine. Otherwise, other than this rash, you're feeling well in yourself, there's no temperature, no joint pains, yeah? No joint pain. No. But I realized I have tried those antihistamines and didn't work. You've tried the antihistamines and didn't work. Okay, which one did you try? The one over the counter. Okay, so like cetirizine? Yeah, okay, that's fine. Right, okay, so from what you're describing, it looks like, you know, it is quite widespread, your eczema, yeah? Because you're having it all over your chest and hands and things like that. So, do you have any allergies to any medication at all? No, no allergies. No allergies, okay. And you don't, other than eczema, you don't have any other medical condition? I have asthma, and in my family, there is hypothyroidism and migraine. My mother has migraine. Mother has migraine, and what was the other one I didn't understand? Hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism. Who has hypothyroidism? My mother. Okay, so she has hypothyroidism. Okay, that's fine. Right, you mentioned you have asthma. So what medications are you using for asthma? You know, probably inhaler. The blue inhaler, so you don't use it every day so you just use it on and off yeah. Yeah, yeah. Blue inhalers but your breathing's all okay yeah. Okay yeah, yeah. It's only when I have a flare. So what we need to do is obviously you've got extensive as I've mentioned so so extensive eczema. What we'll do, we need a couple of things, because to keep you a bit comfortable, you would probably need some antihistamines, which I'm going to prescribe. Also, hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you can use for young children. You might probably need a bit more stronger one like betnovate or something like that Okay, so we'll try that first so I'm going to be it's called the antihistamine is called fexofenadine and then we will try with some betnovate first so it's like very small amount like it's like one fingertip one fingertip. This much is enough to cover your palms and back of your hands. So it's a very small amount, so that if you can imagine, you can cover the whole body. So use that, you have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks. Okay? Okay. If there's no improvement, you need to get back to us. Or if you have any kind of adverse reaction, like an allergic reaction, which is unlikely, but if it still happens, you need to get in touch with us. Okay? Okay. Thank you very much. So what we're going to do is we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy. It looks like boots on the systems, is that correct? Yeah? Yes. So I'll send it across to boots and it will be there for collecting. If things are getting worse in the next two weeks, call us beforehand, otherwise wait for two weeks, take the medication and the cream. You still need to continue on your emollients like the dermo soap and as well as the diprivate. So you still need to use those in the interim. Any questions at all? No, no questions. Thank you very much. You take care then. Bye bye now. Thank you. Bye bye.
