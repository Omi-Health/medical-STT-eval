Hello? Good morning Kim. How can I help you this morning? So I'm having some pain in my tummy, like the lower part of my tummy. And I've just been feeling quite hot and sweaty. Right, I'm sorry to hear that. When did your symptoms all start? About two days ago. Okay, and where about in your tummy is the pain exactly? Like below my belly button. It's like quite sore when I press on it. Did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more gradual? It's more gradual and it's getting a bit worse now. Okay, okay. And can you describe the pain to me? It's kind of like a, I guess, a burning pain. And it's just right there in that spot, like that's mostly where I'm feeling it. It hasn't spread any else. Justin, just blow your belly button you weren't mentioned. Yeah. Okay. And is the pain constant or does it come and go? It's very constant. It's like getting worse. It's not like, I can still move and walk around. I mean, I'm still kind of functioning. It's just, I'm aware of it all the time. Okay. And with the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms at all? So, for example, let's focus first on your bowels. Are your bowels working okay? Yeah, I had a bit of constipation, but that's better now. That was like since last week. Okay, so you've got no other symptoms like diarrhea or loose stools? No, my bowel movements are normal now. Okay, and what about your waterworks? Are you passing urine okay? Yeah, that's fine. I did notice that it was a little, the urine was a little pink in color, but I haven't really been burning specifically or hurting when I pee. And I did notice I was going to the, I was peeing more regularly, but I have been drinking lots of fluids, so I wasn't sure if that was related to the pain. When you mentioned pink urine, was there any blood at all in your urine or is it difficult to say? I can't say, I mean maybe. Okay, alright, but otherwise it doesn't hurt or sting when you pass urine. I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that, just that I'm peeing more than enough more regularly. Okay. Okay. And moving up towards other symptoms, have you noticed any vomiting or feeling nauseous at all? Just a little nauseous, but no vomiting. No vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers? I haven't really, I felt a bit hot and sweaty, but I haven't really measured it, so I can't really say. Okay, fine. And, Kim, just a quick ask, you know, or female patients, just questions about your cycle, if you don't mind me asking. Are you currently, are you currently sexually active? Yeah, I've had the same partner. We were last sexually active about four days ago. My last STD screen was normal, which was about six months ago. Okay, so you've had no other partners since then? No other partners since then. Okay, and do you use any contraception at all? I'm on the Implanon, I had the Implanon inserted about a year ago. Implant, okay, fine. Are you still having periods? Yes. When was your last period? My last period was about three weeks ago, I mean two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, okay. So is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implant in, but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? It's something I have to think about, but theoretically, if the implant hasn't been working, then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect. Okay, well, something I have to think about, maybe we have to do a pregnancy test later on just to confirm that. Okay, and so just to summarize so far, if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple of days this tummy pain that's really affected you, mainly lower down towards your belly button, it's quite burning, you said it's getting worse, you noticed some pink urine, but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine, your bowels are working okay, you felt a little bit nauseous and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right? Yeah, that sounds very accurate. Is there anything else perhaps that you feel like you should share with me at this stage which you think might be important? I don't think so, I think we've covered everything that's really bothering me. Tell me a bit more about your medical history otherwise, are you normally fitting well? Quite quite well. I haven't had any surgical... I don't have any surgical history. I don't have any previous... I haven't had any operations before or and I'm not on any other medication. I just have the implant. Okay. Have you had anything like this before in the past, any similar symptoms? I've never had these symptoms before. No. Okay. Fine. Any other family history I should be aware of? Anything relevant family related to bowel, maybe related to gynecological history? No, not that I'm aware of. Okay, alright. And socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you? I live in a share house with two other roommates. Okay. And are you currently working? Yeah, I am currently working. What do you do for work? I am an accountant. Okay. Do you smoke at all? No. No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Socially I drink, but I don't think more than normal. No, no. Okay. Just before I go into the examination, I want to go through just a few screening questions. That's okay, yes or no. We've covered the majority of them already, but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else. How's your chest? How's your breathing? I don't feel short of breath or I'm not having any problems or I don't have a cough or anything that's bothering me. Okay, any funny heart beats or rhythms, palpitations? Nothing, no. Okay, any headaches, any problems with your vision? No, no. Okay, all right. Fine, okay. So really just moving on. So based on your story really, Kim, it's a difficult one. It's, we know you've got some primary pain, we don't exactly know what's causing it. It could be a few different things that keep causing your pain. It could just be a, you know, it could just be a urine infection, for example. It could be something related to your gut. It could be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy related cause. And so it's probably worth doing some tests initially to try and rule out what's going on here. Which I can organize for you today. Okay. And the base on those tests, we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed. But certainly, if it's been going on for the last couple of days, it's probably worth empirically treating you for a urinary infection. Can we do that instead of me going for tests and then seeing how that goes? Yeah, absolutely. So, I think it's certainly worth covering you with some antibiotics today, but I still want you to bear in mind having a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here. And I want you to come back and see him in a few days time if your symptoms are not getting any better or indeed if they're getting worse. So things to look out for would be, you know, worsening tummy pain, if you're feeling really hot and sweaty, the temperature's not coming down, vomiting, et cetera. Does that make sense? Yeah, I think I'm happy with that plan. Okay. You can sometimes help with your urine symptoms. Take the antibiotics and give me a call if you are worried about anything else. Sure, that sounds great. Thank you very much. Should I just collect the script at my pharmacy? Yeah, I'll send it straight to your pharmacy. Start the antibiotics today, something called trimethoprim. Take two tablets, one tablet twice a day for three days. Okay, great. So that sounds great. Let's see how you get on. Okay, thank you very much. Great. All the best. Bye.
