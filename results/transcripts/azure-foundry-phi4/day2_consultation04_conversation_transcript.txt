A couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get to get an idea of how to get to get an idea of how to get an idea of how to get an idea of how unwell you are okay the first thing I'd like to do is to try and measure your pulse so the way we're going to do this is that if I can get you to try and locate the pulse in your wrist not everyone can do this so don't worry if you can't but if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse, it's just under the thumb. If you put your fingers up and down like that, you might be able to feel the pulse. I've got it. You got it, okay. Are you sure? Yeah. All right, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you when to start counting and when to stop counting, okay? so I'll just get my stopwatch up. Okay, so if you can, you've face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to face to presents, it's more insidious over a longer period of time with other symptoms. However, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding when we see you. Okay. Are you worried about lung cancer? Well, you know, if finding when we see need to be cognizant of, okay? And we may end up having to do a follow-up chest x-ray if things don't settle down. But at the moment, it seems more like a chest infection rather than lung cancer. That's good to know. That is good to know, yes, because that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are okay because chest infections can become nasty as well. It can lead to infections inside the body. We want to avoid that as well. So let's get you checked out today and hopefully we can put your mind to rest and get you on the right course of treatment. Perfect. Thank you very much. All right, you're welcome. All right, take care then. All the best. Bye.
