Hello? Hi. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, I can hear you. Hi. Right, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age, please? Sure. I'm Amanda Jackson, and I'm 19 years old. 19 years old? Okay, Amanda. And how can I help you this afternoon? So, it's been going on for a few days now. It's not happened before and I'm a bit worried. It hurts when I kind of pee. And yeah, it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more. And it's really like I can't go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet. It kind of hurts sometimes when I'm like in the bottom of my tummy as well. Right, I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can see why it's affecting you. So you mentioned you've been going in for the last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. You going to the toilet more often as well? Is that right? Yeah, it's been going on for a bit longer than three days, I think actually. Maybe just under a week? Oh, under a week, sorry. Sorry, no, I didn't explain it properly before. Yeah, no, I, it's been going on for about just under a week and yeah, I noticed sort of burning, stinging when I, when I go to the toilet, yeah. Have you noticed any, anything in your urine for any blood or discoloration of urine? I think, well, today I noticed it was like a bit pink, the urine. Yeah, I think just today. Have you noticed any kind of frank blood, I mean red blood at all in your urine? I think it was pink, probably. I don't know, it was pink, so. Okay, fine, we'll have to definitely explore that in a little bit more detail later on. You also mentioned some tummy pain as well, can you tell me a bit more about that pain? Yeah, it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy, mainly when I go to the loo, I think that's when it's worse. Okay, Can you describe it as a crampy pain, is it more of a burning pain? I wouldn't describe it as crampy, I don't think it's like a period pain. It's a bit different, it's hard to say, an achy pain, I suppose. Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back, towards your sides? No, no, no. Okay, alright. Any other symptoms at all, for example, nausea, vomiting? No, you're vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers? No, no, not that I've noticed. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working okay? I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any different. What would you say you have problems? What kind of problems do you normally have? I think I have IBS, so I just pass my bowels quite a lot. And sometimes it's quite variable, like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, sorry, this is a bit disgusting, but sometimes it's a bit harder and it's kind of hard to predict. Okay, all right. But have you noticed any new symptoms in your bowels? No, no, not that I think. Okay, all right. And Amanda, sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions, as you can imagine. Can I ask, are you currently, are you currently sexually active at the moment? Yeah, I have a long-term boyfriend. Okay. And have you noticed any other discharge from down below? So, from the front passage? No, I don't think so. Nothing unusual. Okay. Do you use any form of contraception? Yeah, I'm on the pill. On the pill? What kind of pill is it? Is it a combined pill or the mini pill? Combined pill. Okay, fine. When was the last time you had unprotected sex? If you don't want me asking. I mean, unprotected is it like no condoms or anything? Yeah, exactly. I guess because I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend. Just like, I don't know, we've just kind of agreed. So, I guess a week ago, two weeks ago, something. What I'm trying to get at is whether there's any chance you could be pregnant at all. I know you're on the pill, but we nonetheless do have to ask. When was your last period? Two weeks ago. Two weeks ago. Okay, alright. Just something for you to bear in mind if your symptoms don't get any better. Okay. Fine. In terms of your general health, otherwise at the moment, are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, yeah, eating and drinking okay. I did have one kind of concern, I don't know. So I smoked, this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time like a week and a half ago. I just wonder whether it's related at all, probably not, but I just thought I'd get some advice from you. Sure. Well, thanks for sharing with me. So, I don't think it's related to your symptoms. I think it's probably just pure coincidence. But, you know, I do strongly advise you to, you know, make it a regular habit if you can, just for your general health moving forwards. Okay. Moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions apart from IBS? Is there anything else I should be aware of? No. No. Okay. great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis apart from the combined pill? Apart from the pill, I take something for the IBS as well. It begins with an M, it's pretty hard to pronounce, like maybe. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's it, yeah, that's right. And then there's the cramps, the crampy pain. Yeah. And do you have any allergies, any medications? Yeah, I think there was an antibiotic called clindamycin, that I took like half a years ago, something, and yeah, that didn't go too well. Right with me. Okay, sure. I'll make a note of that. In terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys? No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. then. Very good. I think they're okay, generally. Great, and what are you studying at university? I'm studying English. English, okay, good. And how are you enjoying your course? Yeah, yeah, it's going well, thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago. Yeah, I really enjoy it. Very much. Good. In terms of smoking and alcohol, do you participate in either? As I admitted before, I tried weed for the first time, but I don't smoke. I drink occasionally, socially, with friends. Okay, and what made you have your first joint last week? It was just a party. There were a lot of people doing it. I kind of was a little bit tipsy, so probably wasn't thinking quite straight. But yeah, I completely agree. It's not something I want to get into on a regular basis. Sure. And obviously, your doctor is here to look after you, so I would strongly recommend you to avoid it. Great. Fine. So at this stage I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story, I think I'm reassured by the fact that I think it's probably just a simple what we say a UTI or a cystitis bladder infection. You haven't got any other symptoms that suggest to me there's anything to worry about. So things like fevers and back pain would be more worrying for me to hear. So some we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. So we've got a choice of two antibiotics, something called trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin, which is a three day course. Normally they're usually quite effective for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample as well if you can, so we can send it off to the lab and see exactly what's going on there. Start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids. If you are having some pain, simple paracetamol would probably be advisable. We'll see what the urine sample shows, and if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones. But if things are still not getting any better next week, come back and see me, and we can have another look again. Okay, okay, great. With the urine sample, how do I go about doing that? Is it through the app? No, well, good question. So I will organize for you to come in and drop off a sample at our practice, which we can test there and then with the urine dip and send it off to the lab and we can always get back in touch with you with the results. Okay, perfect. Okay, great. Do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those, give me a call, okay? Fever, back pain, vomiting. Great, okay, yeah, I'll shout those. Okay, have a good day. Okay, thank you, you too, have a good day. Bye-bye.
