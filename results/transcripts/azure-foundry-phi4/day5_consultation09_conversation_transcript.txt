Hello. Hi there. Hi can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address please? Yeah, it's Matt Carter and it's 14th of August 1989 and what was the last bit? Your address. It's 1 Babylon Avenue. And are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today? Yes. What can I do for you? It come in, I don't really know what's been going on, but it's just aching all over for definitely the last six weeks it might have been slightly longer than that but it's just sort of fat feeling really tired run down. Okay, so when do you think you were last well? Where are we now? We just started April. Definitely Christmas/New Year. I felt relatively well, I think. So since then, actually, yeah, I was on holiday in the States and yeah, it probably coincided with sometime around then end of January start of Feb. So do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back? Probably a couple of weeks after I got back. Were you well when you were on holiday? Yeah, I had a great time, very active. Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhoea, vomiting, anything like that? No, not that I recall. Yeah, not, no, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards. Okay, so just tell me what symptoms you've been having. In terms of just your general health, any persistent cold symptoms or earache, sore throat, chest, cough, shortness of breath, phlegm, anything like that? No. Any change in your weight at all? I don't think so. I'm probably less hungry but no weight change, just a bit. Are you eating different amounts? Yeah, probably slightly smaller portions or yeah, more of an effort to actually eat everything that's in front of me. Any difficulty swallowing or acid in your throat or abdominal pain? No. Any change in your bowel habit, diarrhea, vomiting, or blood in the stool? No. Any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine? No, that's all fine. Okay, and any other general symptoms like rashes? I don't have any rashes now. In fact, I've got a photo on my phone if that's helpful. I can try and show you. Hang on. Because this, yeah, this was weird. This sort of came up and then disappeared after a couple of weeks. That was light? I don't know. Whereabouts was it? I think sort of calf, back of my calf, because I didn't notice it, my wife noticed it actually. When did you first notice it? Probably around the end of February, the middle to end of February, and then it didn't actually cause too much itching or anything at the time, and it faded over a couple of weeks, I guess. Did you have any fevers at that time? To be honest that actually coincided with a bit of a sore throat I had so possibly a little bit feverish but I sort of put it down to that. Do you know where you got that when it started? Had you been walking? Did you get any bites that you noticed? I definitely, like, I do quite a lot of walking and we did quite a lot while we were out on holiday as well, but definitely, yeah. I mean, I don't recall any bites, I don't remember seeing anything, but you often, like, yeah, as you're walking through, I was in shorts and boots, so you feel the odd bit. Whereabouts were you in the States? Just sort of near Yosemite. So. Okay. And any headaches, blood, vision, tingling, numbness? No. The sort of headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy. And have you been able to go to work as usual? I've been going to work, I don't know how effective it's been, but yeah, I've been. And what's your job? I work for a health technology company actually. Okay, and has your concentration been affected or your tiredness levels in the daytime at work? Yeah, definitely sort of tired and yeah less energy sort of. It probably engaged than I would normally be. Have you been able to exercise okay? Not as much. I don't know if it's I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it. I'm not exercising as much as I would normally. Okay, and how's your mental health, your stress levels? I look pretty good at the moment actually. Like, previously that has been an issue but other than sort of physically feeling a bit crappy, I'm yeah, in a pretty good place. Okay. Apart from that rash, any other rashes on your skin or swelling of your joints or pain in your joints? Yeah, sort of aching shoulders, back, hips, knees, but sort of... Any swelling that you've noticed? No. What, hands, wrists, ankles, toes? No. Okay. And any other significant medical problems in the past? Asthma and hay fever if they count. Pardon? Asthma and hay fever if they count. Okay, any flare-ups of your asthma recently? No, it's pretty well controlled. Do you take any regular inhalers or other medication? Yeah, I've got one of those preventatives, I think. Yeah, I take it twice a day, but I've not used it yet. You haven't been using it yet? I have, I've been using the every day for the morning and night, but not the Calbuterol. Okay. And any, do you take any other medications? I take one of the anti-hypertensive drugs, it might be cerazine, can I get that from just from the pharmacy? Yeah, that's fine. And do you smoke? No. Drinking alcohol? Sorry, occasionally that one. Okay. And who do you live with at home? Just my wife. Sorry. So with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, it's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels. I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the normal things like liver, kidneys, blood count, et cetera, but also some more specific things like a bacterial infection you can sometimes get, including one that you can get, which can produce a rash like that. So that would involve blood tests. Are you happy to do that? Yeah, I'm generally happy with blood tests. What's the infection? Well, you can get a bacterial infection caused, which is called Lyme disease, that you can get a rash from a tick bite. So that's something that we would do a test for as well. And if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it. So it's definitely worth checking for, but we would also check just for other things which can cause reduced energy, tiredness, and aching for persistent over six weeks. Okay. So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line, and then when you've had the test, arrange a follow-up that week after you've had the test done. Okay, so do the test first and then and that follow-up we can just do over the phone again. Yeah, yeah, we can do that over the phone to start with. Excellent. Okay. That's really helpful, thank you very much. Thank you, Jim. Oh, sorry, you broke up a bit there. Any other questions? Oh, no, not, no. Okay, that's great. Take care. Okay, take care, thank you. Bye.
