Hello? Oh hello. Hi. Hi, how you doing? My name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name please? Yeah, that's her. Daniel. Hi Daniel. And your date of birth? Yeah, male. 1992. 92. Okay Daniel. And are you in a comfortable and confidential place to talk? Yeah, totally. Happy to go ahead. Great, how can I help? Yeah, I just, my chest has been feeling really tight. Okay, and how long has this been going on for, Daniel? Daniel: For about three hours now. Okay, and so tight chest for three hours, and so you're born in 92, so it makes you 26. 26, yeah. And you are any shortness of breath at all with that? Yeah, like a little bit. Yeah, a little bit short of breath, not too bad. Any cough, wheeze? Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well. Coughing, yeah. Light cough, yeah. Sore throat, runny nose, sore ears. You know, I had a cold last week, and it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose, just feeling under the weather. You feeling better now other than the tight chest? I mean I feel worse but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore. Right, okay, okay, but now you've got this, so you've still got symptoms of a cold essentially. Yeah, the cough's kind of stuck around. Yeah, okay. Now you coughing up anything? No. And do you have any other medical problems like asthma? Yeah, yeah, I have asthma. I've had it for a while now. And then I have like a hay fever, you know, some allergies, dust, and things like that. Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any medications? Yeah, so, you know, the Ventolin, it's called Salbutamol. Yeah, I got that one and then I have a steroid, Clenol, Clenol inhaler. Clenol modulate, yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. And have you been using Clenol and the Ventolin and how often have you been using them? Well, to be honest, I was away at uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me, so I haven't really in the past week. Both of them? Because, sorry, they ran out and I forgot to go and grab the next one. Yeah, sure. About a week ago. Okay. So you haven't got any Clenil or any Ventolin at the moment? Not with me right now. No, I ran out. Okay. Alright. And any drug allergies, you know? No, no, not allergic to anything, just like just the dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs. Okay, great. Now, do you, anyone in your family have any medical problems you know of? Yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Oh, when I was young, I also had eczema and I had a milk protein allergy when I was young too. Okay. Right, so just, do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or hopes for this consultation? Not really, like I feel like asthma is probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers would be helpful. It's just kind of scary because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight in a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I can imagine. Well, it certainly sounds like you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough, and it's nonproductive cough, and you're short of breath. Is the cough worse at nighttime? I mean, it gets a little bit worse at night, but basically, just pretty consistent. It hasn't gone away. And you've got this tight chest, but you wouldn't say you've got chest pain, it's more a tight chest, is it? No, not really pain, it's more like tight. It just feels like sometimes you can't get a full breath in, you know? Yeah, sure. Okay, well, I would quite like to certainly get you some Ventolin, Clenolmodulate. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit more, like back in high school. But I've been pretty good at taking my inhalers, so not so much anymore. Have you ever been to hospital as an inpatient, as in stayed in there overnight for asthma? Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat. Oh, okay. So you went to hospital and had a, so you stayed in hospital for a few days, did you, with an asthma exacerbation? Yeah, I did, yeah. Okay, but currently you're just on Ventolin and Clenol and you haven't got any of those inhalers at the moment? No, I'd be pretty good, I'd be pretty good just on the clenbuterol and the salbutamol. Sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma attack? I think I was like 17, 16, maybe. Okay. Just to quantify how short of breath you are, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you. No, you won't have, will you? Are you able to like walk up flight of stairs okay, walk in the flat okay without getting too short of breath or are you short of breath at rest? I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like except for that feeling I was describing. It does when I'm walking up stairs, I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be. Sure, yeah, okay, but you're not sure of your breath at rest at the moment? No, no, no, I'm not. Okay, fine. So, what I think, and just to go over it, is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the, a prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else that you had hoped about getting from this? Well, I just want to know that I'm okay to just like, I just don't want to have to get that intubation again. Sure, yeah, no, absolutely. I'm really glad you talked to me today. I think what we can do is give you a prescription for some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within the hour, I would hope. And I think the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So these are tablets which you can take for five days, two tablets in the morning, and that should just dampen down your asthmatic response. Okay? Okay. Now there are some side effects to the steroids which I should really tell you about but please read the label that's associated with it. Don't be too worried about the side effects. They're on most, you know, most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated. And you probably, have you had them in the past, you know? Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Have you had steroids in the past? I can't remember, probably. Probably, yeah, I would probably do it. So they can make you, your mood change, can be slightly low or slightly high, can give you a high blood sugar, and they can also cause rash, nausea, headaches, but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help you asthma an awful lot. What I'd like to do is send you some prescriptions for your inhalers are ongoing, so you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can use the Clenil Modulate in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN. So, a Ventolin when you need to, when you're getting more use. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than every three hours at any time, it's a good idea to seek medical attention so see a doctor in some capacity. And the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Do you know what spacer is? Have you used one before? Yeah, yeah, somebody told me how to use one a while ago. I don't really use it, to be honest. Have you got one? I think I do, I have one somewhere. Okay, all right, well, I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially a couple of passes to prime it inside, breathing in and out for five or 10 breaths. Okay. Yeah. So, was there anything else that was on your mind or you were concerned about at this stage? I think you got me covered. Okay, and I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better if you're okay. Thank you. All righty, well thank you very much. No worries, any deterioration in your symptoms like worsening shortness of breath or just generally concerning symptoms, pain in your chest, tightness, feeling lightheaded, then seek further medical attention and please. Okay. All right, sounds good. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
