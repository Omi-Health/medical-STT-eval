Hello. Hello. Hi. How are you? Good, thank you. How are you? Fine, thanks. Yeah, I'm Joe. I'm one of the doctors at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name, please? My name's Lizzie Irvine. 23rd of July 1995. Right, thank you, Lizzie. And are you in a confidential and comfortable space to talk? Yeah, especially on a Friday. Great. How can I help? Yeah, just for the last couple of days, I've been feeling really sick in my lower tummy and I've had a bit of a temperature, so feeling quite like hot and sweaty, and it's, yeah, I'm really uncomfortable. Okay, so you've been feeling nauseous and you've had some pain in your lower tummy or you say you've been feeling sick in your lower tummy? Yeah, it's more of an ache, so like an ache in my lower tummy. And then I think it's feeling hot, sweaty, so I think it's sickness, but yeah, a bit of an ache. Okay, so if it's feeling hot, sweaty, unwell for three days, feeling sick, nausea, with an ache in your lower tummy, any actual vomiting? So yeah, no, just nauseous, no vomiting yet luckily. And it's only been for a couple of days, but yeah. A few days, yeah. Okay. And any problems with your waterworks or diarrhea? No, so I'm... I'm going to the loo a little bit more often than usual. I drink lots of water, but it does feel like more often. Yeah, like nothing, nothing too out of the ordinary. And I was a little bit like, I don't know, constipated, I guess, about a week ago, but I'm okay now. Okay, so you've been constipated a week ago, you're having regular bowel motions now. You said you had a bit of diarrhea, a bit of watery, did you say? No, it was more like I was just a little bit bummed up and then about a week ago that kind of cleared and I'm normal now. Okay, and you're saying you're drinking lots of water, you're going to the toilet more frequently for a wee, is that? Yes, yeah, I'd say so. I tend to drink a lot of water anyway, but I feel like I'm going to the toilet more. Any pain when you pass urine? No, no pain. No stinging? No, just seems normal, yeah. Okay, and sort of no foul smelling urine or anything like that? No, nothing, nothing I can think of. Are you having, you're saying you're going a bit more frequently, are you having to go with urgency to the toilet, or we? No, there's no urgency. Yeah, no pain or urgency, just, yeah, peeing quite frequently, but it's all seeming normal. Yeah, I probably wouldn't have thought of it being linked, but yeah. Okay. All right, so the main symptom is feeling sick with this, you've been feeling bunged up and this sort of pain in your tummy. Just to ask a few more questions about the pain in your tummy, is it, how would you describe the pain? It's, yeah, it's like below my belly button. It's aching. It does make me feel nauseous. Yeah, so it's kind of more like a, I guess, like an, a dull ache just below the belly button, kind of, yeah, here. And And is it constant or is it coming and going? It's, yeah, it's feeling pretty constant over the last couple of days. And just need to ask a few questions about your periods and stuff. Any chance you could be pregnant at the moment? I don't know. Probably not. I don't think so. I'm broke out. Sexually active at the moment? Yes, yeah. And, you mentioned about periods, I did notice a bit of, I don't know, it's like not necessarily like spotting, but in like, in my, my pee is like a little, I suppose, I think I thought it was my period, it's like a little bit pink. In your pee, did you say? So your pee is slightly pink. Yeah. But I am kind of like due on my, I don't know if that was like, yeah, part of it. Okay, so when was your last menstrual period? Around a month ago, yeah, three and a bit weeks ago. Okay, so it's three and a bit weeks ago. Okay. So it's three. And did you say, so you're sexually can I just clarify when was the last time you feel like you are still quite bunged up at the moment? No, it seems to have cleared up, so I was about a week ago, but I'm okay now, the last few days. Yeah it's been okay. Okay. All right so you just to sort of confirm your symptoms. You're feeling sort of sick, nauseous with tummy pain which is fairly constant. Did the tummy pain come on suddenly or gradually? It's only been for the last two days. So I guess, yeah, quite recently. So it's come on gradually, is it? Yeah. Not sudden onset. Okay. And your last menstrual period was just three and a bit weeks ago. But you say you've had some, a little bit of spotting possibly before, in between periods or recently? Yeah, the last kind of week or so, yeah, the last couple of days really. But because I was due on, yeah, I think, yeah, just the last couple of days. Okay, but you're expecting your period soon? Yes, yeah. Sure. Okay, and just to ask a few questions, do you have any other medical problems I need to be aware of? I'm allergic to amoxicillin. Allergic to amoxicillin, but no other medical problems that I'm aware of. No, not that I'm aware of. Any drug allergies? You mentioned amoxicillin, but anything else? No, that's it. And do you take any medications at the moment? No, no medications, but I'm on the implants, I think it's called Implanon. Implanon, yeah, sure. Okay. Do you smoke? No. Okay. And do you live with, alone, with your partner? With my boyfriend. With your boyfriend. And any other medical, sorry, any diseases running in your family? Not anything that spring to mind in my immediate family. My brother is a type 1 diabetic. Sure. Great, so is there anything that you're particularly concerned about with this sort of nausea and the constipation? I don't know, it's just a really, like, a really horrible ache. And I'm nauseous, hot, sweaty feeling. I'm not really sure why, yeah, why it's happening. The last couple of days, that's probably all that's getting comfortable. Yeah, anything that you'd hoped particularly to get out of having this consultation? Anything, I'm sorry? Was there anything that you'd hope to get out of having this specific consultation other than a diagnosis and getting better and you know being on the right track to feeling better? Yeah, no that's kind of I just want to get back to normal. Yeah, sure. Okay, so, and then finally, I didn't ask you, do you have any discharge or anything like that from down below? No, no, no discharge. No discharge, okay. All right, so, I think this could be a few different things. It could just be simple constipation. You mentioned that you were bummed up, but you did go yesterday. So, and your bowel habits, you've been going regularly, but you did mention that you were bummed up. But there could be a few other things going on. I would quite like to see you to do an examination and to do some tests as well. We need to definitely rule out pregnancy with you and possibly do some other examinations or further tests. So would you be happy to actually see a GP face to face soon, today, ideally? Yes, yeah. Yeah. So I can make time. Are you, and you're feeling hot and sweaty. Have you been feeling lightheaded at all or like you're going to faint? No, no, not like I'm going to faint. Okay, all right, well, we're just sort of tying up, running out of time a little bit, but I'd really like to see you for some more examination and investigations. If in the meantime, between now and me or a GP seeing you, you feel worse in any way, you get light-headed, you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you, then I think take them quite seriously and see somebody more urgently if possible. Okay, was there anything else that you want to talk about right now? I'm glad we've got the ball rolling with this and we can sort of see you again to take this a little bit further. Okay? Yeah, thank you, really appreciate that. Okay. All right, thanks for your time. Cool. Okay. Cheers. Thanks. Bye.
