Hello? Hello? Hello. Just before we go any further, can I confirm your name and age, please? My name is Fiza and I'm 26. 26. Okay. And how can I help you this afternoon? So basically, I've been really stressed at work for the past few days and I've realized that I've got really dry, itchy skin. Okay, sorry to hear work's been so stressful. Tell me more about your skin firstly, tell me, you mentioned it's been dry and itchy, where about in your skin? All over my arms and my hands mainly. Okay, and is this something you've had before? I no, never happened. So did it come about quite suddenly or was it more kind of a gradual thing? I think it started a few days ago. Okay. And has it spread anywhere else? Has it spread to your chest, your legs, your face? No. Okay. So apart from being dry and itchy, any other symptoms?

I have a few days ago. I went swimming a few days ago. I have a few days ago. I went swimming a few days Yes, I did. Okay, alright. You mentioned you've had no other fevers, is that right? No fevers, no vomiting? No. No. How's your health otherwise? It's pretty good, yeah. I'm not on any medication. We'll get some medication in just a second. Do you feel generally run down? Do you feel tired? Yeah, I think I have been quite tired. Are you eating and drinking okay? Yeah, I've been drinking and eating as normal. Your appetite's fine, is it okay? And your bowels, are your bowels working okay? Yeah. No, no problems with vomiting or loose stools. No. Okay. And your waterworks are all okay, your past urine okay? Yep. Okay, all right. So just moving on, in terms of your other medical no. Okay. Well, it's a contraceptive pill. Does that make sense? Is that something you, does that ring a bell now? Oh yeah. Okay. Is it any other medications that you take? Oh no. No. So, in terms of your medication, there's no problems of skin problems in the past, things like eczema or dermatitis. No, I think it might just be the weather. Sorry, what was that? You think it's... I think it might just be the weather. The could be helpful to know. Fine. In terms of family history, is there anything in the family that you're aware of? Yeah, so my dad has asthma and my mum has hay fever. Hay fever? Yep. Okay. Fine. But again, any skin problems I should be aware of? No. No. Okay, alright. Socially, who do you live with at home? It's just me. Live alone? Yep. Do you smoke at all? Do you smoke? Are you a smoker? No, I don't smoke. Do you drink much of alcohol? I no. Recreational drugs? Yep. And you said you meant you work as a primary school teacher? Yes, that's right. The reason I ask is something stress can be a contributing factor. You noticed yourself finding your life to be more stressful recently. All right. Do you think that might have any correlation to your symptoms? I mean, I don't, I don't think so. Okay, all right. Fine. Okay, well, normally at this stage, I would proceed to examination, but based on your story, it's difficult. I think essentially the story is you've got a dry itchy rash on your hands, you mentioned, and your arms, which started perhaps after swimming a few days ago. But no other symptoms you're feeling otherwise well, no fevers, no bleeding or discharge from skin. I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis. Have you heard of that condition before? I have, yeah. Okay. Great. Well, I can give you a patient information leaflet about that, which gives a bit more information about the disease, but it's something that we can readily treat it with a couple of options. We have steroid creams I can give you, which will help with the inflammation, and something called emollients, which can help with the dry skin, and that's something you just need to kind of paste on onto your skin throughout the day for the next few days, and hopefully that helps your symptoms. Okay, cool, thank you very much. You can also try antihistamines, so you can get things over the counter, piritin, loratadine, that can almost help with the itchiness. Yeah, that sounds good. Okay, and that's probably what I recommend. Paracetamol on this occasion wouldn't be helpful. Painkillers wouldn't be helpful I no. Okay, well wish you all the best. Have a good day. Thank you very much.
