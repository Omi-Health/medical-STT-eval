Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yeah. Okay, great. So, how can I help you today? So, you've just been having some problems with your hearing, I can't really hear very well and I notice that my face is just feeling a bit numb recently. Right, okay. Okay. And how long has this been going on for? It's been it's been a few weeks now. In about three weeks or something. Right, okay. and is this just on one side or both sides? Just one side, just on my left side I've noticed that the hearing's kind of gone down a bit. Right, okay and your face feeling numb where exactly is that? Which part of your face can you show me with your finger? Yes, so again it's the left side It's kind of like around my left ear and kind of along here. So like my jawline is just feeling a bit numb around here. Right, okay, okay. Has anything else happened in this time? Any other symptoms you had at all? Not that I have noticed. Occasionally, I have noticed ringing in my ear. Ringing in your ear? Okay. Sure. Okay. And have you had any weakness or numbness down in the rest of the body at all? No, no, no, nothing like that. Okay. Have you had any difficulty swallowing? No. And have you had any difficulty speaking? No, no. Have you noticed any problems with your vision at all? No, that's all good. And do you have the numbness present right now? Yeah, it's kind of there quite often, so all the time. So yeah, right now it feels very, it doesn't feel like when I touch this side of my face. Sure, sure, okay. All right. Just going back to the kind of muffled hearing feeling in the ear, do you have any discharge coming from that ear at all? No, nothing coming out. Any pain in the ear or from the ear? No. Right, okay. And have you had any fever at all? No, nothing like that. And do you have any itchiness in the ears? Do you use cotton buds to kind of clean your ears out? Pardon? Oh, no, no, don't use cotton buds like that. Okay, all right. Do you need to ask a few other general questions? Do you have any other illnesses at all? I've, I've been told I had polyps in my nose in the past and occasionally get some kind of heartburny feeling. That's all fine and you know I take a renies if I need to and if my nose pollics are playing up I've got a spray. Other than that I think they said ages ago I had something called, I can't quite remember but labrinthitis, something like that, but again nothing, nothing on the nose. Sure, okay. So are you on any regular medication. something like that. something like that but again like that but again like that. something like that but again like that like that but like that but again that like that like that but like that like that like that like that like that but again that from a doctor? Yeah, they gave me a prescription ages ago. Do you remember the name of the spray at all? Unfortunately, I don't, sorry. That's all right, that's all right. And you're not on any other medication at all? No. No, okay. Do you have any allergies to any medication? No, just latex. Latex, okay, all right, that's good to know. And in terms of your family, are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all? My brother had neurofibromatosis, I think it is. Right. Other than that, everyone else is okay. Okay, good. That's good to hear. And in terms of your own kind of background now, are you working at the moment? Yeah, so I'm a jockey. But because of all the kind of symptoms I've been getting, especially sometimes when I get a ringing, I can feel a bit dizzy. I've just had to do far less training. So kind of beginning to impacting work a little bit now. Okay, so you have to excuse my grammar. You mean, do you like with horses? Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. All right, okay, fine. Great. And do you live alone? I live with my partner. Do you have any pets at all at home? No, no pets. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what's been going on recently? No, just like, like I said, like the ringing occasionally and when I get back I can sometimes feel a bit dizzy, but the main thing is really the lack of hearing and the numbness that's got me up. Just yeah, no idea what's going on there. Okay, fine, all right. So what I think we go on. It was just like, there was one thing I think, because I can panic and you can look online, get a bit frantic. I guess what I'm trying to think is, you know, is there something particularly serious that, you know, will need to be sorted and obviously, really anything could make you really frantic. Is it hopefully nothing so serious I would die from it? I don't know. I just, I think it's okay. Obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via video portal, but from what you've told me this doesn't seem to be anything that you're going to die from. However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today. Okay? I would like you to come into one of my clinics. I'd like a GP to assess you. What you're describing might be something called Bell's palsy. We can go into that explaining what that is if that's confirmed on physical examination. That's not usually a life threatening problem, but part of the reason why I'd like you to come in is just that we can do what we call a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on and confirm that that might be the diagnosis, have a look inside the ear, see if there's anything to see within the ear. So in answer to your question, no, I don't think that you need to worry about that. I think preliminarily I can reassure you. However, in order to definitively reassure you, I think you need a physical examination today. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to send a message to our admin team. I'll ask them to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics within central London. And then you can ring the support team number. I'll leave that number in your notes. You can ring them after five minutes and then they'll slot you into a place that's convenient for you. Okay? That's fine. So someone will see you and hopefully we'll be able to reassure you further, but please make sure the appointment gets done today. Okay, yeah, no, will do. That's fine, thank you very much. Alright then, okay, nice to see you. Take care, Ned. Bye bye.
