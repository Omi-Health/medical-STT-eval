Any blood in the stool? There was some slight blood in the urine but like it was a little bit pink but. Okay and has this ever happened in the past before? No. Right. Any pain when you pass water? No, that's fine. Are you having to go more often than normal? Yeah, a little bit, but I'm also drinking a lot in these days. Are you more thirsty than normal? Yeah. And you said you felt like around 37. Have you measured it at any other time when it's been raised? Sorry? Have you measured it at any other time when it's been raised? No, no, I just measured like one hour ago. Okay, that's fine. And are you getting any pain higher up in your stomach? Any acid coming up into your throat or anything like that? No, no, I think of that, like just a bit of nausea but not vomiting. Okay, and any other discharge below? No. Okay, and have you been abroad recently? No, no. No, and no similar problems to this before? No. Have you had any other medical problems in the past? No, no, nothing, sorry. I mean, depends, but like normal stuff like cold, flu. Okay, nothing significant. Any allergies to medications? Yes, amoxicillin. Do you take any regular medications? No. Any over-the-counter medications? No. I've had just the implant contraceptive implant, but like for one year, now no more. Okay. And do you have regular periods? Yeah. Any bleeding in between periods or after intercourse? No, no, no. Just like, yeah, no, no. Right, and you haven't felt shivery or sweaty? You said you had felt a bit sweaty. Yeah, a bit of sweat, yeah. Okay, and any back pain or strong smell to the urine? No back pain, no. I typically don't suffer from back pain, so no. Right, okay. Anyone in your family had any medical problems before? So, actually, actually my mom had breast cancer. Yeah, not so important. I mean, just like the beginning, it was cured in time. And who do you live with at home? Sorry? Who do you live with at home? With my parents. And do you smoke or drink alcohol regularly? Yes. How much in a normal week? So I don't smoke, I drink alcohol, let's say four times per week. And how much? Yeah, a a beer per time, like, per time, let's say, on average. What per time? Let's say a beer. Okay. Four times a week on average. Yeah. Right, okay. So it may be possible that you might be having an infection in the urine. If you feel like you're having a little bit of difficulty when you're passing urine, it might be worth taking a three-day course of antibiotics to clear that. But if the pain is getting worse or you have a high temperature or back pain or develop any new symptoms or you feel like it's not getting better, then we should speak to you again because we might need to see you face to face for an examination. Okay. Have you allocated a pharmacy with Babylon? Yes. Okay. So are you happy to take a course of antibiotics if I send it through to the pharmacy? Yeah, that's fine if it helps. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so I can do that for you. Start taking them as soon as you get them. It's just twice a day for three days. If your pain is getting worse or you get new symptoms, just contact us straight away. or if you're getting a recurrence of the same problem again. Okay, sure. Okay, all right then, have you got any other questions? No, that's fine. Okay, thanks a lot. Bye. Thank you. Bye.
