Hi there, I'm Dr. Smith from Babylon. Hi. Hi there, can you just confirm your name, date of birth and the first line of your address first of all please? My name is Valerie Paul. My date of birth is the 19th of September 1993. My address is 64 Cliveden Place in South Wimbledon. Okay, are you in a private place where you can have a confidential consultation today? Yes, I am, yeah. What can I do for you? I've been feeling really anxious over the past few months. I just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house and it started to really worry me and just add up and build on that anxiety and I just didn't know who to talk to so I wanted to check with my GP. Okay. Do you mind just telling me a bit more about when it started? Do you think there's something which changed in your life at that time? I guess so, I think I would say maybe about two months or so I've been feeling like this and that probably coincides with me starting a new job. Which I would say it's quite stressful, I mean every job is stressful when you first start but it's been really stressful I think over the past two months definitely. What's your job? So I work for a fashion retailer in the head office team and it's just a brand new sector. I've never worked in retail before, my boss is not very nice to me, but I also think that it's just been, I just really dread going there, I just hate speaking to her, I hate like seeing everyone, and really worried about whether I'm doing well or not, and it's really impacting on like, on the rest of my life, like my sleep and stuff like that. Okay, so just day to day, tell me from the start of your day, how it affects you, you said you dread going to work, how I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because I'm going to be late because morning that either I feel like I'm going to be late because I've overslept because I'm so tired, or I wake up in a panic thinking I'm going to be late. So it's just kind of like just a constant like rapid heartbeat. It's really stressful. I don't know if it's stress or I did think it was like a heart problem initially. Does it feel like a regular fast beat or an irregular beat? Irregular, I think. And how long do you think it lasts for when you get it? Oh, it can anything. I think it was a couple of minutes or the other day I was actually just sort of lying there for like holding my hand on my chest for like 10 minutes. Is that something that you've had before or is that a new thing? Yeah, I would say this is only in the past sort of like a couple of months, as I say that I've been experiencing this. Okay, any chest pain with that? No. Well, yeah, it's painful to when the heart, when my heart is beating fast, fun is just not enjoyable and I'm like, yeah, on edge the whole time. Okay, so what do you do in the evenings? Well, right now I'm working so late because everything is really the stressful so I don't really get much time for myself, but when I do want to go out or see friends or just relax, it seems quite difficult to do that. Okay, and are you avoiding contact with friends or do you still see them? I avoid them in so much that I feel like I'm... Yeah, so I mean sometimes it just... I know that I'm not going to have fun because I don't want to go out and do things that I would normally have done. Okay, what about hobbies or exercise or anything else outside work? Do you do anything else outside work? Yeah, as I said, like everything that I've had previously been doing is just difficult to continue with. I did use to like to go running and play tennis and stuff, but no, it's just not, I'm just not enjoying it. I'm not going out to do that quite so much. And is it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work? No, because I think that would just add to the tension, but I do pretty much every morning, I think, "Oh, I should call in sick or like, not go." And what's the worst that it's got? Have you ever been so overwhelmed that you couldn't get into the office, you couldn't go into the tube, because it's quite getting warmer, so it's just really airless. But I think the majority of it, because my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well. Okay. Before this, did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this? Not really. I mean, everybody always has a bit of tension, a bit of anxiety, but I've never felt anything that's bad before.

And then like, maybe a glass of wine during the week. Do you smoke or take any other drugs or anything? I try not to smoke, but I do occasionally, but I don't take drugs. Okay. And have you done anything yourself to help? Have you talked to anyone, talked to any counselors, done any online, looked online at all? Anyway, I talked to my mom because she also suffers from, or she's suffered from like depression in the past. I didn't think that it was, that I was suffering from actual depression because it just seems to be manifesting as just stress the whole time. But I did talk to my mom about it. I haven't saw any, she recommended that I come to the GP. But I haven't saw any other. And would you be happy to have some one to one therapy? Yeah, can do to try and overcome that. So I can send you the link for that. In the meantime, so it can be a bit of a wait, there are some online resources that are really helpful. Put the details on there and you can get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well. And if you're feeling like it's not helping at all or your anxiety is getting worse to the point where you can't cope with work or you can't just do your normal things day to day, then it's important for you to give us a call back and just discuss that further. I mean, some people with anxiety, they do need to take medication to control that, but that's not something that we've suggested in the first instance. Okay. And I'll put some more information on your notes about helping with your sleep patterns and things like that. That's great. I look forward to reading it. In terms of palpitations, it is more likely to be associated with anxiety, but it's probably worth having a couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that there's not something triggering that off and then arranging a GP follow-up a week after you've had the test so we can just go through the results with you. Okay, okay. So if you call this hotline you can arrange the and have the blood test done. Okay, I'll call them up. Okay. Thank you so much. All right, take care. Have a good day. Bye. Sorry, it's like way over.
