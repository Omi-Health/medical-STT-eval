Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. Can you hear me? I can hear you well. Hi. My name is Dr. Gohil. I'm one of the doctors that works at Babylon. Can I... Hi, Dr. Gohil. My name is Roberto Mendoza. Can I check your name and date of birth, please? Yes, my name is Roberto Mendoza. I was born on the first of January of 1992. Okay, and are you in a space that's quiet and you're able to talk? Oh, sorry, I am 1990, sorry, I'm 48, sorry, I forgot that. So you're 48, and are you able to talk at the moment? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Tell me, it says here you have a, you're, you're having problems going to the toilet? Yes, so I have a, I have a, I don't know how do you say it properly in English, I mean, it's like diarrhea. Okay. Yeah, so it's lasting for like three days. And yeah, I don't know, I don't know what would cause it. I have a bit of abdominal pain and I had a bit of vomiting. But these are kind of like what is happening to me. Okay. Tell me how you were three days ago, before this started. Did you have any medical problems? So I have, I have, I have asthma and I take some, some inhaler. Okay. I don't know. I take an inhaler. And I have an allergy. I have an NKDA allergy. I don't know if it's because... I don't know. And apart from asthma, do you have anything else? I don't know, maybe it's because you know, this thing here in the stomach and stuff, I always have in the back of my head of my father, because he died about 10 years ago of bowel cancer. Okay. So yeah, this is kind of the, my worries, I don't know. Okay, so you've had the diarrhea for three days and now you're having pain and vomiting? Yes, yes. Has the diarrhea been getting better or worse? I think it's not getting better or worse. It's kind of like, like, either, like normal. Like it hasn't gone away, it hasn't worsened. Okay. And how often do you go to the toilet? I go, I need to go, I can't go to work because I need to go like every, I don't know, is this feeling like I go to the toilet and then when I finish I need to, I feel I need to go again? Okay. And yeah, so I need to be like close to the toilet. That must be hard. Yeah, yeah. Have you had to drink more water than normal? I don't know, maybe I'm not drinking enough water. Yeah, I think I don't drink enough water. An important question, have you noticed any blood? No, I haven't noticed any blood. And you mentioned tummy pain, can you tell me more about your tummy pain, like where it is and if it goes anywhere? So the pain is mainly focusing in the center area of the abdomen, like under the belly, under the belly button. And sometimes I can hear my stomach like the cramps. You've been able to eat and drink? Yes, but I go to the toilet so often, so I try not to eat a lot because I just go to the toilet every 10 minutes. And you said the tummy pain is in the middle of your tummy, does it go anywhere else? No, no, just there. And it seems to be alleviated a bit in the toilet and maybe it's like gas, I don't know what it is, but. Okay, and when was the last time you vomited? I think it was this morning, this morning. But the thing is like because I'm not eating anything now, so I haven't vomited again. Did you have any breakfast? I don't know. I didn't. No, sorry, yes, I did actually, I did. I had some fruit. Okay, and you vomited that afterwards? And afterwards I didn't have anything, then I got a bit of nausea and I vomited, and then, yeah, and was it, and that was it. I have any symptoms then, so now I think I'm okay, but yeah, I don't, yeah.

But just to double check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing? I always have problems with my breathing because of the asthma. Like when I exercise, I need to use my inhaler a little bit, but apart from the normal, I haven't. And how about chest? Have you noticed any chest pain? No, I haven't noticed any chest pain. And how about walking and talking, are those all okay? Walking and talking, yes, yes, but yeah, I don't walk very far because I need to go to the toilet now and then, so I'm spending some time at home. And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain? Oh, it does a little bit. Sorry, I was just writing some things down. Sure. So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain. Okay. And it's no, this is normally called gastroenteritis, so an infection over the tummy. Oh, okay. Normally when patients have this, we do three things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids, because you're losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers. So if you start getting a temperature, then you need to take paracetamol. And your three is stay home for the time being until you not sure if I had a bit of fever but very little or but I don't think so I don't think I don't know maybe so I think that's what we should do for the time being if you feel you're getting much worse then I would suggest you go and see your GP in real in real life in person so they can look at your belly. Okay I will yeah I will book then. I will wait a couple of days to see or one more day and then I will book. Great. Do you have any more questions for me? No, that's it. I was maybe just concerned about my father's medical history, if that would... Yes. So, the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had. But if your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look up from the GP. Does that sound okay? Yeah, that sounds good, that sounds good. Thank you very much, doctor, for your time. Bye bye.
