We are, yes. Okay, so I understand you're having a headache. Is that correct? Yeah, I've had a sort of, a fairly sort of bad severe headache for the past four days. And I've been sort of feeling a bit hot as well. Got a bit of a temperature, I think. I haven't measured it, but I think, yeah, I think I've got a fever. Okay, right.

Okay. Okay, so what we need to do is we need to urgently examine you, and that's sometime today. Okay. And after our examination, there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to the hospital, but I'm not sure as yet. So I'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible. I'll write night notes and recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor, preferably in the next few hours time. And in any case, if that's not available, I'd like you to take yourself to A&E. Okay. All right, any questions at all? No, sounds serious. It's, you know, obviously when I've spoken to you, you didn't tick the box for many serious, but you're in the middle somewhere, let's put it that way. Okay. If you know things like we have to rule out is meningitis and all but then you just have a general muscle ache. You didn't say that you had things like you had problems looking at light or something. So those are things when we think of meningitis but and then it's the in meningitis you get a non-blanching rash while in any kind of viral illness, you know, the rash usually goes okay. Saying that, we don't know whether these are the beginning stages, so that's why I'd rather, but I would rather you see a GP as soon as possible if we've got a slot available but if not I think you need to be seen and maybe have some blood tests and examinations. Okay. Okay, cool. Thank you very much. All right, you take care then. Bye now. Cheers. Bye.
