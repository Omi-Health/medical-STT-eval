Spoken.So it's been a few days now. I have like a sore and a red skin. It's kind of, it's really itchy and it's like super annoying. So I'd like to find something quick to solve it. No, no problem. I'm happy to help. Whereabouts on your skin is it affected? Mostly like my chest, my hands, my arms. Like, agree, it's super annoying. Like, it's itching a lot, like, all the time, and I can't even sleep at night, like, I really need something quickly to solve it, because even at work, like, when I'm in a meeting and I have to, like, think about my work, and focus, like, actually focus on my work, it's really annoying because I can't actually think about what I have to say. I'm always disturbed by this disease. No, no, okay. I understand. This is obviously affecting you and we'll try our very best to get this sorted out for you. Have you had anything like this before in the past? So yes, earlier I was like prescribed for my eczema. And they gave me like some cream and something to when I was in the shower, I had to put something. Did it help? And I mean at that time, yes, but the symptoms, like, when the symptoms appeared again, I tried those and it didn't work. I've tried a few things, like, I bought a steroid cream at the pharmacy last night, but it apparently didn't help because it's still itching me a lot today. Okay. Do you remember the name of the cream you bought? Steroid cream? Okay. Would you say the symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms or different? It's much more like itchy and my eczema was more like only in the arms and now it's also on the chest and in the on the hands as well. Okay. Yeah, I like for instance hiking during the weekends and I some parts, like kind of cracked if you see what I mean. But yeah. You haven't noticed any other pus or blood coming out of your skin? No. And you mentioned it all started three days ago. Four days ago. Are you aware of any triggers, anything that you may have done that may have caused your symptoms to start? So for example, have you changed your shower gel, any clothing? Have you been around anyone? No, it's actually, it's very annoying because I'm thinking about maybe I should change something because I haven't and I don't understand and I'm kind of afraid of asking people around me because it's kind of, you know, I don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions. It's kind of intimate and so I really appreciate your help now. No, no, okay, that's okay. Fine, so just to re-summarize, for the last four days you've had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, mainly your chest, and did you also mention your arms and legs as well?

It's also worth using antihistamines, which you can sometimes buy over the counter, things like loratadine or pyrilone, which can help with the itchiness of your skin. And it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use in terms of shower gels or soap because if that's causing your symptoms then we need to have a discussion about it next time I see you. Okay, just I have tried antihistamines lately but it didn't really help. Oh, could you say it again, sorry? say anything using the steroids and the emollients on a regular basis over the next week to 10 days should hopefully control your symptoms. But do come back and see me next week if things don't get better. That sounds good. Okay. Do you have any questions for me? No, that's it. Okay, well I wish you all the best. Thank you very much. Thank you, have a good day. Bye, thank you later. Bye.
