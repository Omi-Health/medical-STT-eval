Right. So, uh, I've been having uh, diarrhea for like, let's say past three days, more or less.
Okay, right. I'm sorry to hear that. Uh, can you tell me a bit more about your diarrhea? Yeah, so it's been a very bad diarrhea. So it keeps me like, I keep going back and forth to the toilet very often. Right. Um, yeah, it started like three days ago. Mhm. And, uh, uh, so it started with vomiting.

It's definitely definitely watery, uh, loose stools. Yeah. Okay. Any blood in your stools? No, not that I could see. Okay. And, uh, uh, with the diarrhea, have you noticed any other symptoms like tummy pain? Uh, not, not really. No. Uh, but I I I feel like, um, I can't really drink too much, so I feel very dehydrated. Okay. When you say you can't drink too much, why is that? Uh, yeah, because really I I, um, I'm like I feel like I don't drink enough. Like I'm I'm drinking. I'm trying to drink, but then I just go to the loo and I like I, uh, I I poo everything and I feel dehydrated again. Okay. All right. Um, have you managed to eat anything solids? Uh, not much, not much. So just a little bit, but I don't feel uh, I don't really feel like I have appetite. Okay. Your appetite reduced. Okay. Um, with your um, the vomiting is now stopped, is that right? You said Yes. Yes. Okay. All right. Have you any any other symptoms like fever or temperature? Uh, so not really. I I feel a little bit warm, um, probably at the at the beginning I was feeling I had a bit of temperature, but now I feel I feel kind of fine. Okay. I feel very weak though. Oh, weak. Okay. All right. Any headaches or muscle pains? No, not really. No. Okay. All right. And you mentioned three days ago, what were you doing when the symptoms started? Are you aware of any triggers? Uh, not that I remember. What was I doing? I I was at home. I was working on my computer and, yeah, I just felt some nausea and I had to to vomit and then I had some diarrhea after that. Yeah. Did you have any takeaway food or any dodgy restaurant food? Uh, not that I remember. Okay. Have you been around anyone unwell with diarrhea recently, last week or so? No, not that I know. Okay. Okay. Um, right, so moving on. Um, are you otherwise fit and well? Yeah. Yeah. I'm Uh, okay. And do you take any regular medications? Um, so I I do suffer of asthma. So I do have my inhalers, uh, that I, you know, I I I use infrequently, let's say, only when I have uh that the blue inhaler. Sorry? Is that the blue inhaler? Yes, it is. Yeah. Blue inhaler. Okay. All right. Any other medications that you take? Uh, no, nothing. Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medications? Uh, not that I know of. Okay. And any family history of any medical problems?

I'm a software engineer. Software engineer. Okay. All right. Have you taken time off work recently? Uh, yes. Yes, I have. Uh, this last three days I've been feeling really unwell, so I couldn't work. Okay. All right. And just last couple of questions regarding your smoking and alcohol. Do you do either of those? Uh, not really. I drink infrequently, like socially, let's say, and I don't smoke. Okay. All right. Um, fine. So, Robert, um, I think having listened to your story, I think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis. Okay. Which essentially is just a tummy bug. It's an infection of your your tummy. Um, and normally lasts for about three to five days and gets better. All right. The things you can do to really help yourself get better soon, um, are you can drink plenty of fluids, really try and flush the toxins out of your body. Okay. You can get things from the pharmacy, which are called Dyralyte, which can help replenish any minerals and vitamins you may have lost. Sorry, what's the name of that? It's called Dyralyte. Um, it it's it's a type of fluid replacement drink. Um, you can take some paracetamol if you're feeling feverish and weak. I would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for the next day or two until you get better. Okay. Normally you have to be diarrhea free for about 24 to 48 hours before you return back to work. Um, let's see how the next few days go and if you're still not better next week, I want you to come back and see me, and we can have another look at your symptoms, okay? That sounds good. That sounds good. Uh, thanks so much. Do you have any questions for me? Uh, no, I think that's fine. Uh, yeah, I'll I'll try to rest and drink plenty of fluid and I hope it go away. If it doesn't, I'll I'll call I'll call back. I really hope you get better soon. Thanks a lot. Thanks so much for your time. Bye-bye. Okay. Bye.
