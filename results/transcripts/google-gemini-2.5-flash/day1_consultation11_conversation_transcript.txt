Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me okay? I I can hear you, but I can't really see you. That's perfect. Um, is that okay? Am I meant to just connection on the screen. It's audio. No, no, it's absolutely fine. Now, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age? Um, so um, my name is uh, Dan Choudry. I am seven 27. 27. Okay. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan? Um, so I've just um, been having some troubles. Basically in the, uh, I guess it's been a little while now and I've just been feeling not so great and it's all come from like uh, it's like basically, I think it's diarrhea and it's like just coming out like loads of it like I go to the toilet and it's just superb watery and it Yeah, it doesn't feel very solid. It's so just, it's just pouring straight from my bum and like just coming out and it's uh, yeah, it's just uh, not, not been very pleasant and like I just, it just kind of hasn't doesn't feel like it's getting better, so. Wow. No. Sorry to hear that. It seems like there's a lot going on there. What when did it all start your symptoms? Um, so I think it was a few, when I think about it. So Monday, Tuesday, I I saw, I think it was about three, it's been about three days now. Okay. And is it mainly diarrhea? So you mentioned watery stools. Um, how many times are you going a day, would you say? Um, so I I feel like it's like almost every hour when I'm awake. Um, Right. Wow. Okay. So you're losing a lot of Right. You're losing a lot of fluid there. Yeah, so I mean, I'm I'm trying to drink a lot of water but um, yeah, it's just quite a lot and uh, it's yeah, I think I I feel like it's just just fluids coming out. Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stools? Um, So I No, I don't I don't remember anything like, no, I I think it's just nothing like that. There's nothing like that. And any any tummy pain? Any any any pain in your tummy? Yeah. I mean I it I feel I feel a cramp and then and then I know it's time to go, right? So around every hour I just feel something come up and then I have to go. So yeah, I mean that's that's the kind of the first sign. And where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy? It's kind of I so when I if I think about it, it's like, it's like at the bottom. Uh, I don't know if that makes sense. Um, Right. Why don't we start with is it, is it in the middle or is it to one particular side? Um, I I think if it feels pretty like in the middle to me, not on any side, left or right. Okay. And does this pain come and go or is it there constantly? Um, it it comes and goes. It comes and goes. Fine. Okay. And if I was to ask on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you've ever had, how bad is this pain? Okay, so like Um, Yeah. So, What do you mean by, uh, pain? So I I think it's maybe Is it, is it is this pain that's making you double over? It's ten, is it, ten out of ten the worst pain you've ever had or is it more of a kind of a mild pain like a three out of ten? I I guess so I'm, when I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it so I can still sit down and, uh, I can still like cover it up and people don't really notice, so I, I don't know what that means but maybe is that like a six or a seven? six I think. Okay. Okay, okay, all right. Um, apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting? Um, yeah, I definitely, I definitely feel kind of nauseous. Um, like I and like I've have vomited and when I like I think it's maybe something to do with like whenever I have like milk or something like that, I just feel like I wanna vomit and actually like yeah, one time I just like had some milk and I just completely vomited it. I've been trying to avoid it but um, yeah. Okay, all right. Um, the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea. Is that right? Um, sorry, could you repeat that? The vomiting is not as uh, prominent as the diarrhea. Is that right? Um, no, no, it's not. Okay. Okay, all right. Um, any other symptoms like fevers or temperatures? Um, so yeah, I think I am pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time and um, I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading or anything like that, but it's uh, yeah, I've, I've, Okay. sure I'm, I'm not, uh, like not a normal temperature. Okay, so you're feeling hot? Okay. And in terms of your waterworks, are you passing urine okay? Um, yeah, but I guess less frequently maybe. Um, but yeah, seems to be okay. Okay, all right. Um, fine. And you said you mentioned three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you, for example, gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else with diarrhea for example? Um, so I know, so my um, my brother has had actually had something like this for um, he has it as well for five days as well. Um, and I I I'm not, yeah, I can't think of what what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally can deal deals with this stuff a lot better than me, but yeah, I that's why. Is your brother now better? Um, he so he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not, I'm not really sure. He said he said he had he's had something for a little while as well. Okay. All right. Are you having anything to eat or drink? Have you I can see you're drinking your coffee but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down? Um, so it just feels like um, the fluids do go down, but it just feels like it's going straight through. It just feels like it's going straight through. Okay. All right. Fine. When was the last time you ate anything solid to eat and which kept which which you kept in? Um, so I had some I mean I had some lunch today. Um, but again, it just it did just came come out pretty loose. Okay. All right. Um, and and Dan, moving forwards, are you otherwise fit and well? Do you have any other medical history? Um, so I um, yeah, I think I I think otherwise I'm fit and well. I um, yeah, I mean, I I'm I'm an okay weight and um, I I can't think of any related medical history. Um, I mean, like my yeah, I no, I I don't think so. I'll take it. You don't take any regular medications then. So I Um, No, I mean, I I've been taking some like paracetamol and stuff like that lately, but I I haven't been I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that. Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications? Um, so I don't have any allergies that I know of. Okay. And what about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? Um, bowel. So with bowel like, does is the colon like something like Yeah. Yeah. So what I mean by bowel is the whole gut really. Anything from the mouth to the anus. So my, yeah, my my dad actually has um, colon cancer at the moment. Oh, dear. I'm very sorry to hear that. How is he? So, um, from what I heard, he's kind of so I don't I don't speak to him that often, so I don't, I don't know the exact details and I I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer and all that. anything but um, he's sort of in his third stage. Uh, I'm not sure what that means exactly. Um, Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, it's it's um, he's yeah, you can I can see he's kind of weaker and it's affecting him a lot and um, that's what he says. It's quite I I guess he's um, had it for a little while now. Well, sorry. I'm very sorry to hear that. I'll make a note of that because uh, important to know these kind of details. Um, and socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan? Um, so uh, not my brother. He doesn't live with me. I'm I live with my um, sister and my mom. Okay. And uh, how are things at home? Um, in what sense do you mean that? Just in general day-to-day life. Are you managing okay? Any particular stresses? I mean, uh, I think, uh, yeah, it's been, it's been tricky, um, going to work with all of this. Um, I dislike, um, taking time off work. I feel like I I just wanna go, um, when I can, so I I try and go, um, I think at home, uh, yeah, I just haven't really, um, I I don't normally actually, um, eat with my family. I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing. So I don't think it's affected them and I haven't really been, I haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mom about it. Um, yeah, I I just rather deal with these things. Um, so you mentioned work. You mentioned work. What is it you do for work? Um, so I work at an I I work at, um, an office, um, in Central London. Um, it's uh, so I work in government. Government. Okay. So, Okay. Right. Just a couple of last final couple a couple of questions there. Smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol? Um, so I I smoke, um, I smoke, uh, uh, for like socially, but not like regularly. Um, so normally if if it's a a Friday or something like that, I might I might have a cigarette or something like that, but um, Sorry? And alcohol? So alcohol um, I you know, I might have a a beer during the weekdays, maybe uh not that many maybe. Um, on Fridays I have more um, alcohol. Um, yeah, uh, I'll a lot more units. Um, on it I suppose, um, not every week but maybe uh, once or twice a month, but yeah, I'll I'll go out with my friends and we'll drink a lot so that that's um, yeah. Thank you for sharing with me. That's very helpful to know. So, um, Dan, just as a conclusion, um, just to wrap it all up. I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis. Okay. A bit of a, basically, infection of your tummy. Oh, you're good. It's nothing to worry about. I I I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days. Just like it did for your brother. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids, okay? Um, you can I just drink like normal water. I just feel like every time I drink, it's just coming out. Um, Clear fluid is probably best. But I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. Um, so you can get things like Dyoralyte, which is um, a fluid replacement you can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth recommending that. Do I need like a prescription for that? No, you can just get that over the counter. Okay. Um, you can try just, you know, regular paracetamol if you are feeling feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so forty-eight hours, I want you to give me a call back because um, you know, if you are getting dehydrated, then we need to do further investigations, okay? But I think let's, let's see how you are the next one to two days. Okay. And uh, we'll catch up soon, okay? Okay, so you're saying that I should I could, uh, I'll try and buy this Dyoralyte. What what should I do in terms of um, food and that kind of thing? Should I just focus on fluids? Food is okay. Yeah, absolutely. So clear fluids, you can use soft diet, things like soup, mash, and then gradually build up um, as much as your body can tolerate. Um, but really let's try and keep us off, well, hydrated first, okay? Okay. Is it okay for me to carry on having like um, paracetamol and things like that? Absolutely. If you are having if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think paracetamol is very sensible. Okay. Okay. Try and avoid alcohol if you can. Uh, okay, I'll try. Yeah. Okay. All right, then. Okay. Thank you for your help. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks for By-bye now. Okay.
