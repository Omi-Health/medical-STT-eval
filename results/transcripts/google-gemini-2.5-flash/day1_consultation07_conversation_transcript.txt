Trying to keep the fluids up as well, you know, I hear that's what you should do. Yeah, absolutely completely recommend that so keep keep doing what you're doing. Um, and just lastly, you know, any any kind of muscle pain, joint pains? Yeah, it's it's it's just been a I mean, again, you know, I'm I'm getting just a wee bit older now, so it's it's not something that I I was thinking about, but I have I have noticed like when I, you know, when I'm bending down and you know, moving about, it's just a wee bit stiffer than than normal. You know, and I I think that might be to do with whatever this thing is, but again, it's, you know, getting. Where do you feel the stiffness? It's just kind of like, you know, when you're when you're bending like elbows and knees and just just a wee bit kind of stiff, you know, all over. Okay. And just remind me, when did your symptoms all start? You say a few days ago. Yeah, I would say what day is it today? It's Wednesday. It's Wednesday. So that would have been what is it? Saturday because I was out. Okay. I was out having dinner and then yeah, I I came Yeah, yeah, yeah, it would have been that. So I was out for my wife's She's She was doing this wee thing with a wee bit of celebration. So we're out for that. And I remember saying to her I was like, you know what? I'm I'm I'm not feeling great. I, you know, I I stuck it out with her, but I it would have been that Saturday. So what's that about five? Four or five days. Five days ago. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you aware of anything that might have set your symptoms off? Is it something you you've eaten, or have you been traveling recently abroad, or No, I haven't been haven't been traveling. I mean as I said, I was out with my wife. I don't know whether it's like, you know, the restaurant we went to was like it was like pretty good. So I wouldn't have expected them to be serving me anything dodgy or anything like that, but I I I don't know, you know. Okay. So, I can see. And with that prying too much, what were you celebrating? Well, my wife has just been uh promoted. So she's now going to be uh a head teacher of of primary school. So just to congratulations. Yeah, we we night on the tiles for that. So. Very nice. Yeah, yeah. Well, good. Excellent. So, just moving on, sir, regarding your um what would we say past medical history, are you, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? So, anything to do with your heart, lungs? Uh, I've been I'm a I'm a wee bit on the chunky side, you know, uh, you know, I've I've got a wee bit a wee bit around the midriff. The spare tires definitely there. Uh, and I've I've got the uh, I've got the diabetes. Diabetes, right. What type of diabetes? Is it type one or type two? Uh, it's it's uh, type two. Type two. Type one. I I cuz you said the last doctor I spoke to was sort of saying like, you know, as a bigger guy, it's it's kind of it's it's kind of like, Yeah. Yeah, okay. And uh, I when I was speaking to this it was a an another doctor I spoke to a while ago, but I when he took the when he was telling me this as well, he took my blood pressure and that he said that was that was high. Uh, high, higher than it should be. You've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, or was that just a one-off? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right. So, um, moving on, in terms of your medications, which medications do you take on a regular basis? Uh, give me I'm just going to check. It's it's let me know if I'm pronouncing this correctly, cuz I haven't I haven't got my glasses with me. So it's Met Metformin. That's correct. Okay. And and there's another one. List Listenopril. Listenopril, yeah. That sounds correct. I think that's those two. I've I've got them written down on a wee bit of paper, so No problem. No problem. That's fine. Anything else, sir? Uh, no, no. Just just just those two. Yeah. I mean a wee bit like, you know, a wee bit of Aspirin or whatever every now and again but, you know, not nothing long term. Okay. All right. And just moving on swiftly, sir. Do you have any allergies at all? Uh, not that I'm not that I'm aware of. You know, I mean what what what are the allergies you get? Just Just allergies from medications, really, I'm I'm asking not as opposed to um other things. Right. No, nothing nothing that nothing that I'm aware of. Doctors never said anything to me. So. Okay. And just very briefly, socially, sir, just one very important to ask. Uh, you said you live with your wife. Anyone else at home with you? Uh, no, no kids. The kids have uh they've flown the nest. So, uh I just just me and the missus. Okay. You know. Okay. Good life. Yeah. And are you working at the moment? Uh yourself? Uh I am. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uh, well, it's one of the it's a wee factory just uh down the road. Um, so we just, you know, we just manufacture like uh uh, like kind of steel, steel parts. Uh, things like that, you know. So, it's uh a good wee job, you know. Keeps us over the over us. Pays the bills. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. What about smoking and alcohol, sir? Do you do either? I I do I do like a wee drink. Uh, I the doctor I had, he he he did say I was drinking just a a wee bit too much. I mean, I'm not like, you know, I'm not not an alkie or anything, but just just uh, yeah. Do you like a few a few pints every now and again. Can you roughly, on average, how many you'd drink a week? Uh, pints. Well, whatever you drink, is it pine, beer, larger, wine, spirits? Beer. Beer, you know, maybe maybe about like four, four pints and like a Saturday and then, you know, a Sunday as well. May maybe like nine nine pints in a week, I would say. Okay. Okay. And what about smoking, sir? Uh, we Every now and again, but I'm I'm I'm trying to cut that down. I've got a we uh, what are those we things called? The wee vaporizers. Okay. Yeah, I've got I've got I got myself one of those. So I've been I've been cutting down in the cigarettes, uh, and I just got this wee this wee thing. It's great. It is it's actually like amazing by the way. I wish you all the best on your journey to quit. I would I highly recommend it. Um, if you can, it will certainly help your health as well. Um, so just to really just to summarize, I think, you know, based on your story, um, I'm not I'm not worried. I think, you know, what what you essentially have is a bit of a a bit of a viral illness perhaps, a bit of a maybe early signs of a flu, um, which I think should settle down um really on his own over time. Um, things to, you know, you can do to help yourself, you know, stay rested, drink plenty of fluids. All right. Um, if you are if you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular paracetamol will be beneficial. Um, you mentioned feeling a bit short of breath. I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but we could think about is giving you a a script for antibiotics, which you can maybe use next 24 to 48 hours if your symptoms don't get better. Right. So, so so if I'm I just I just lie down and take it easy. Yeah. If I'm still feeling a bit rubbish, then Yeah. I'll go and Yeah, yeah. I'll give you a script today. Give it about 24 to 48 hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and run down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like Amoxicillin, one tablet three times a day. Um, and then, you know, if you're still not better by next week, come back and see me and we can have another look. Right, okay. Okay. So, I just plenty of rest, lots of water. Exactly. Hopefully that next pass. Yes, absolutely. Right, that is that's perfect. That's just what what I wanted to hear. Great. Well, I'm glad I could help. And uh, Cheers. I wish you and your football team all the best. I I hope so. I hope so. It's not not looking too good but uh, I. Thank you. All the best. Bye.
