What can I do for you today? Um, I've been having this blinding headache for a few days. Um, and it's like really bothering me and uh I find it very hard to focus or like I can't even go to work. Okay, and any headaches in the past before this? Not really, just the on and off. Um, I recently had the one for like two days, um, but it just went away with ibuprofen so nothing like or longer than two days before. So how did this start? Um, it just started all of a sudden, I woke up one morning with a headache and that was three days ago and I just keep having it. It doesn't really go away without ibuprofen either, I try that, but it just it gets a little bit better but like doesn't go away. Okay, and where about in your head is the pain? Um, it's kind of all over, but I feel like over my right eye is bit stronger. Okay, any problems with your vision or any problems tolerating the light? Um, light definitely make me more sensitive like um, I don't really like strong lights. Um, and um, yeah, vision, I think I get this shooting lights sometimes. Um, not sure how to explain it. It's just a bit of a weird kind of vision. Okay, and um, any any nausea or vomiting? Um, no, feeling a bit sick, but no vomiting. Any tingling or numbness or weakness anywhere? Uh, no. Any change in your smell or taste? No, no at all. Um, and in the past when you've had headaches what have they been like? Um, I would say quite normal headaches just um a bit of a pressure in between my eyes, um but nothing major. Okay, and with with this, is it been there all the time or is it coming and going? Kind of all the time, um, sort of when I take ibuprofen and it gets a bit better so it's a bit like less, um, it bothers me less, but then I still have it, it's still there. Um, and what would you say the severity is if if ten is the worst pain you've ever had and zero is nothing what would you say the pain is like? I guess it's mostly eight and then it can it comes down to maybe a five. Okay, and what about at night time? Are you able to fall asleep? Um, yeah, I'm sleeping well. Is it waking you up in the night time? No, no, no. But I can wake up with it in the morning. Okay, any worse when you change position or bend over or cough or anything like that? Um, sometimes when I stand up quickly, I get a stabbing pain, um, or if I turn my head like I kind of feel like something is moving inside. Okay. And have you had any, uh, eye checks recently? Um, yeah, I've actually had one recently and nothing changed in my vision. Okay. And have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears or pain over the sinuses? No. Or flu? No, no. Any any nosebleeds or coughing up any blood or anything? No. And just recently, have you been well or have you had any general problems, any change in your weight or tiredness, lack of energy, anything like that? Um, no change of weight. Maybe, um, lack of energy but I might be because I'm just having this headaches so I find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities but, you know, when you have this constant headache. Are you at work recently? Um, I work from home but couldn't really manage to do it all the time, so sometimes I just take the day off. So you've been you've had a headache for three days, how many days have you missed off work? Um, so I work from home all these three days and um, first day I work from home and then um, the second day I just took the whole day off and today I just tried to work from home the first half of the day, but I I just stopped in the morning because I couldn't focus. Okay. And any other medical problems in the past? Um, I think I only had abdominal pain, um, when I was younger, but no cause was found and that went away, but that's the only thing I know. Okay. Have you been abroad recently at all? No. Do you take any medications? Um, just the pill. Which one? Um, Mercilon. And when did you start that? Um, about a year ago. Any side effects with that? Uh, No, I don't think so. Have you noticed any any increased frequency of headaches since you started that? Um, no, I because this just started recently, but nothing, um, three days ago when nothing really changed. Okay. And when you'd when you've had when you described your headaches in the past, you said they were just general. Did you have any visual symptoms, flashing lights, nausea, vomiting with them? No, nothing, none of them. Have you had your blood pressure checked recently with your pill? Um, yeah, I had it checked in the pharmacy when I got the pill and they said it was normal. And when was that? Uh, a year ago. Okay. Um, and any allergies to anything? No. And who'd you live with at home? Sorry. Who'd you live with at home? Uh, just by myself. Okay. Do you smoke? Uh, no. Do you drink any alcohol regularly? Yeah. How much in a normal week do you think? Um, probably like three beers once a week. Okay. And do you take any other drugs at all? Uh, no, apart from the ibuprofen that I take sometimes when the headache gets really bad. Okay. Um, so I mean it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache and you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well. Yeah. But you haven't had a high temperature, have you checked your temperature? Uh, no, I didn't, but I don't really feel feverish or anything. Okay. Um, I mean it it it could possibly be a migraine type headache, but the fact it's so ongoing for three days, we probably should book you into an appointment to get an examination. Um, obviously it's if if it settles in the meantime, then we can cancel that, but we should do a neurological examination, look at the back of your eyes as well. Okay. Um, in terms of medication, I can prescribe you something similar to ibuprofen, but a bit stronger, which you can take instead of ibuprofen, and you can take paracetamol at the same time. Okay. So if you're happy to book a appointment with the with the support line for us to do a full examination, and start the medication which I've prescribed to you, take it with food. If if you're, you said that when you go to bed your headache's okay, not waking you up in the night time. Yeah, it's not. Um, but you mentioned migraine and that um, reminded me that my mom suffers from, actually has migraines. Okay. Any other family history of medical problems? Um, no, I didn't ask it, but I know that my mom like she has quite bad migraines. She's like has the vomiting and everything. Okay, that's fine. Um, I mean if if in the meantime before your appointment your headache is getting unbearable, getting worse or changing, then if it's that bad, then you should go to A&E and have an examination. Um, otherwise you can call us for further advice on that. Mhm, okay. And when when you have an examination with us, we'll check your blood pressure as well. Just to make sure your pill is still appropriate for you, because sometimes if we if we do think it's a migraine then you would have to change your pill. If you've had these flashing lights and things like that. Is there anything in the pill that can cause it or is it Well, some so that pill if you were having regular migraines with um, flashing lights or other symptoms it wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill particularly. We'd have to change it to something else. All right. But you can carry on with that for the moment. Okay. Have you got any other questions? Um, so would you like um, send me a referral to a specialist or Yeah, please book an appointment with the support team, then we can do a full examination then. Okay. Perfect. All right then. Take care. Thank you very much. Bye.
