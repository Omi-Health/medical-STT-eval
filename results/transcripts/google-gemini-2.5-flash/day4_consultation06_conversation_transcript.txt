And your date of birth? Um, 27 of March of um 90. Again, how can I help today? Um, so I'm having like a really, really strong headache. I don't know what is happening. I'm quite concerned. So it started in the morning. Um, I feel like, uh, uh, dizzy, uh, my vision is a little bit blurred, um, like it's, it's really painful and I'm getting really concerned, especially because I'm having like these uh, changes in the vision. Okay. So, it started this morning was a sudden onset headache. Did it come on suddenly? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And did it come on really bad or did it start off, uh, like a slight headache and build up to a, a severe headache? Uh, it came like kind of suddenly. And if you if ten is the worst pain you've ever felt in your life, how bad would you say the pain was between one and ten? Well, I had a kidney stone, so let's say that that's ten. Um, I have now, maybe five. Well, six, six, probably. Six out of ten. But it's more about me being really concerned because this is very weird. Okay, now that's fine. Have you ever had a headache before? Sorry. Have you ever had a headache like this in the past? Um, well, not really. Okay, so this is the first? Like this Yeah, like this, no, definitely. It's something new. Okay, okay. If you had to say where across the head, uh, the headache is? Is it across the front, around the back? It's in one side, uh, the left side, only. And tell me what visual problems are you getting? My vision is quite blurred. Um, it, it's, it's really weird. Like some zigzag lines. Okay. Kind of I don't know how to describe it properly. Okay. And, um, have you tried any painkillers for this already? Yeah, I tried paracetamol, but, uh, it didn't work. To be honest, I feel exactly the same. Okay. Um, Okay. Um, what time did you take the paracetamol? How long ago was it you've taken it? Uh, well, uh, the, the headache started like four year four hours ago, so I would say like maybe three hours ago because I couldn't stand it. Okay. Um, and your visual problems are still ongoing now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel a little bit a little bit better looking. I cannot stand screams. Um, but, yeah, definitely. And when I move, like the thing is that if I if I leave bed, I start to feel like even worse if I move. So I just want to have my hair my head like really, uh, not moving. Okay, okay. Um, so what about have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit? Oh, yeah. Oh, I forgot to mention. Definitely. I vomit twice. Actually, as soon as the the headache started, I also vomited. So initially, I thought it was something that I ate, but then the headache started to be really bad. And I still feel nausea. Still nauseated. I'm about to vomit very soon, I think. All right. Okay. You've mentioned in the past you've had kidney stones. Any other medical problems? Sorry. You've mentioned that in the past you've had kidney stones. Have you had any other medical problems in the past? Uh, so, uh, uh, not actually. Uh, my mother has migraines. I'm not sure if that's relevant. And, uh, also, I have hypothyroidism in the family, so it might be, I don't know. I I don't know. What else do you have in the family? I think we are losing connection. Sorry, I I think we lost connection. Oh, can you still hear me? Oh, it's gone. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can hear me.

Uh, yeah, not that I'm aware. Okay. Is there any chance you could be pregnant? Uh, I really doubt it. Fine. And you're not allergic to any medications. Fine. From And what what were you thinking might be going on? I know you seem quite worried about it. Was there anything in particular you were worried about? Well, I'm a little bit hypochondriac, so I feel that this can be some kind of brain tumor or something because I'm like this is really the pain is so horrible that or maybe a stroke, I don't know. It's it's just like, you know, you hear so many stories that you definitely start to wonder if I should go to any urgently because I might really have something serious. Okay. Okay, fine. Um, now, just another question. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs, anything like that? No, no, no. And when you're walking, you're able to walk fine in a straight line or is your your walk are you walking a bit funny? Uh, not really. Okay. It's really about the head. That's why I find it very weird. Okay. So just just to clarify what what you said. This morning, you woke up and then later on in the morning, about four hours ago, you've developed a headache. Um mainly on the left side of the head? Yeah. Left side of the head. Is it behind the eye? Sorry. Is it behind the eye? Is that where the pain is?
