Hi. Hi. Hi, how are you? Uh, yeah, I'm all right. Um, well, I'm actually feeling a little bit, uh, wheezy. Okay. My name's Dr. Good. And one of the but well. Can I confirm your name and date of birth, please? Uh, yeah. My, my name is, um, uh, Tina Smith, and I'm 40 years old. Okay. And are you in a space that's quiet and private? Uh, yeah, yeah. I'm just, um, in my room. And you mentioned that you're wheezy? Mhm. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Yeah, so, um, it started like about two days ago. Um, I don't know if it's because, you know, I was like cleaning the house and like, um, all this dust came out of the, the carpet and, you know, I've always thought that maybe you've got a, an allergy to like dust, um, or something. So, I don't know if it was triggered by, Um, you know, two days later, still not gotten any better. So, um, just getting a little bit worried about it now. Okay. So, you were cleaning the house two days ago, and that's when it first started? Uh, yeah, that's right. Did the wheezing start suddenly or was it gradual? Uh, so it started after maybe, uh, an hour or so. And has it got worse over the past two days? Yeah, so it gets a bit worse, um, at night, I find. Okay. And have you taken anything for the wheeze? Uh, no, no, I haven't actually. Okay. So, and the wheeze has been getting worse and today you're particularly worried, is it because you're finding it hard to breathe or finding it hard to talk? Yeah, yeah, a bit of both actually. So, um, I'm feeling like a little bit, uh, short of breath. Okay. Um, and actually when I'm, you know, talking, um, to my friends and stuff, finding that, uh, sometimes, um, I'm unable to, uh, complete my sentences. Um, it, it can get really bad, yeah. And when you can breathe and you take a deep breath, do you notice any pain? Um, no. No, no pain. Okay. And have you noticed yourself feeling dizzy or the room spinning more than normal? Uh, no, no dizziness. Um, none of that. Okay. And have you been eating and drinking okay, particularly water? Yeah, yeah, I think I'm having like, you know, four or five glasses a day. Yeah. Okay. And are you normally fit and well or do you have any other medical problems? Um, Well, actually, uh, I used to have like a bit of, um, asthma, uh, as a child. Um, and also in the summer I sometimes get, um, hay fever. And when you get hay fever, do you take medications for it? Uh, not really. Okay. And your asthma, did it resolve when you were a child? Uh, I think mostly, yeah. I mean, sometimes when I, um, run for like long periods, it can, it can start up a bit, but, um, I have a, I have like an asthma inhaler I use for that. Okay, so do you still have your inhalers? Um, I think I might have one from like, a couple of months ago. Okay. But you don't see your doctor regularly for asthma. No, I don't. Okay. And apart from this, do you know if you're allergic to anything? Uh, not that I know of. Okay. And how far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment? Sorry, could you repeat that? How far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment? Uh, they maybe, minute's drive away. Okay, good. So, given that you've had a history of asthma when you were a child, and you get hay fever sometimes in the summer, your shortness of breath, Hi, I've lost, um, video signal. Can you still hear me? Um, yeah, we just turned it off. Okay. So, given you've got a history of asthma and hay fever, this could be one of two things. But we want to rule out asthma or an allergy first. Okay. So what you'd need, Okay. What what sort of? Is visit one of our clinics, so we can do some more tests. Such as check. Okay. What what sort of? So the first thing we would do is use a small device on your finger to check the amount of oxygen in your blood. Okay. And from that, we can tell if it's asthma or something else. Right. Okay. Before this happens, if you've got something like an anti-histamine, which you normally take for hay fever at home, I would take one just in case it is an allergy you've had from the dust. Okay. Uh, yeah, I don't have any antihistamines at home, unfortunately. Okay. You might be able to get one on your way to the doctor's surgery, if not, they can prescribe you one. Okay. Okay. So I can just get it over the counter then. Yes. And they're normally about four to six pounds. Great. Is there anything else that you're particularly worried about or want to ask me? Um, um, not really. I mean, I have before taken steroids for asthma. Um, I don't know if that's relevant. Yes, that is, and you may need to take some steroids now, but we cannot, we, we won't be able to know until we've done those tests first. Okay. Okay. Cool. So I'm going to write a letter for your GP just to let him know what's happened, and the consultation with the GP in person shouldn't take too long. All right. How long do you think it will take? Probably 10 minutes. Okay. That's great. Cool. Um, you should get the letter over the app and then we can, you can take yourself to the GP. All right. Cool. Thank you very much. Okay, bye. Okay. Thank you. Bye bye.
