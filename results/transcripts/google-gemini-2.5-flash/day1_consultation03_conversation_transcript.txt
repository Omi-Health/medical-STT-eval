Hello.
Hello.
Hello there. It's Dr. Ha. How can I help you this afternoon?
Oh, I've just got a terrible headache since midday. I'm on the left side. It's just making me feel so ill. I just feel like I need to vomit.
I'm sorry to hear that. Um, can you tell me a bit more about the headache?
Well, you know, I noticed some zigzag lines in my vision a few minutes before the headache started. My vision's blurred. Um. You know, it's just I, yeah, pain's just horrible. It's just making me feel so unwell. Um.
Mhm. Okay. And.
Work and I just want you to do something.
Well, let's try our best. Let's try and get you, let's try and get you well soon. Um, you mentioned this on your left-hand side, is that right? And it started at midday a few hours ago.
Yeah.
Okay. Um, did the pain come on quite suddenly or was it more of a gradual build-up?
I don't know, really. It just happened.
Okay. And are you able to describe what kind of headache it was? For example, was it throbbing or was it more of a sharp pain?
Yeah, I guess it's, yeah, I guess it's throbbing um on that left side.
And is it moving anywhere else at all?
No, but it's worse when I move.
Okay. Is that when you move your neck?
Well, like if I lean forward or like move my head or neck, yeah, the headache gets worse.
Okay. Um.
I'm just really worried. Like I've just been googling and like I've read that, you know, if your if your headache gets worse when you move it, it could be a sign of brain cancer.
Okay. Is that what you're worried about?
Yeah.
Is that is that what your main worry is today?
Oh, yeah, yeah. And I've like, you know, My my friend's mum, she she recently died of a of a brain tumour, so it's really concerning me actually.
Oh, dear. I'm sorry to hear that. I can I can understand why it's affecting you. Um, but why why don't we why don't we take a good history first and let me examine you and then we can have a little chat afterwards and see what's going on here. Um, so you mentioned a few things. You mentioned the headaches, and you also mentioned some zigzag lines um before the headaches came on. And your vision has been blurry as well, is that right? Is that on a left is that on both eyes or just a left left eye?
It feels like it's on both.
Both eyes. Okay. Have you had any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all?
Yeah, well, I'm wearing I'm wearing sunglasses right now because just, you know, light's really hurting my eyes.
Oh, I see. Okay. Um, and you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous. Have you vomited at all?
Yeah. I've vomited twice.
Twice, okay. And this earlier today. Okay. Um, any temperatures or fevers?
Um, no, I don't feel feverish.
Okay. Um, any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed?
No, I haven't noticed anything like that.
Okay. Um, fine. Um, and do you normally get headaches?
Um, not really prone to them. No. No, but I did I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago.
Okay. And what happened then?
Just similar.
How long did it last for?
Couple of days.
Did you do anything that made it better?
Um, yeah, I had to take painkillers and had to sort of go to bed and rest and.
Yeah.
I had to take a couple of days off work and I work in the fashion industry and you know, they're wondering what's going on, like I just take sick days. Yeah. And I need to get back to work today, but, you know, what if it is a brain tumour, what's going to happen with my future, my career?
You know.
Yeah.
I'm really worried about this. I've never had headaches like this before. Why should I get them now?
Yeah, sure. And I can see your concerns. Obviously, there's a lot a lot of worry there. Um, but you know, let let let let's take a step by step um, and see exactly what the cause of these headaches are first. Um, I'm just going to ask you some um very uh yes no questions that's okay. Um um um, have you noticed any problems with your speech at all? Any difficulty with your words?
No.
Any problems with your arms and legs? For example, numbness or weakness?
No.
Any difficulty with balance your balance or coordination?
No.
Okay. And have you had any injuries to your head? Have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head?
No.
Okay. All right. Um, and and you're feeling otherwise okay? So, for example, your um uh your your breathing's okay, you're not feeling breathless or No. Okay. Um, do you have any other medical history I should be aware of?
No. I don't think.
So, for example, if you had if someone told you you've had migraines in the past?
No.
No. Okay. Do you?
My mum, my mum had has migraines, but I've not been diagnosed.
Right. So my next question was about family history. Is there anything in the family? So apart from migraines, is anything else, anything related to the brain for example?
Thyroid as well.
What was that, sorry?
My mum has an underactive thyroid as well.
Underactive thyroid as well. Okay. Um, okay. Any other problems, for example, the brain or um you mentioned brain cancer. Any other family history of that?
No. No. Okay. Um, in terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis?
Um, I take the pill Microgynon.
Okay. And how long have you been on that for?
Uh, three months.
Three months. Okay. And is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else?
It's for contraception.
Okay. All right. That's something we might have a little discussion about today as well. Um, uh, well my next question was about um your social your situation at home. You mentioned you work in a fashion industry. Is your work is your job quite stressful at the moment?
Yeah, it's really stressful actually. Having problems with like people at work, you know, managers like putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver and oh, yeah. It's not a good time.
Does it get you down?
I don't feel down. I just feel a bit stressed.
Okay. All right. And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally?
Nothing really.
Okay. Do you do much in the way of exercise?
No. No. Okay. Um, who's at home with you?
Um, I live on my own.
Okay. Um, are you coping okay at the moment?
Fine.
Yeah. Okay. And do you smoke at all?
No. No.
Do you smoke or do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
No.
Okay. All right. Um, so normally at this stage, I'd kind of proceed to examination. Um, but um based on your story, um I wonder whether you may um may have a migraine, a migraine type headache. Um, it sounds um very classical of that of that nature, the the the headache on one side, throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, um sensitive to bright lights. I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious such as meningitis or indeed brain cancer. I know that was your big worry of yours initially.
Thank you. I'll thank you so much. I was so worried that I had cancer and oh, now you say migraine. Yeah, I guess my mum had similar symptoms to me and Yeah.
Yeah. It all makes sense.
Well, I hope that puts your, you know, your mind at ease. Um, certainly this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month. Um, so I think moving forwards, there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary will be quite important to see exactly what's triggering these headaches. We should also try and treat your headaches today, some some strong painkillers will be advisable. So, you know, I'm thinking about Paracetamol or even Co-Codamol, um, and some anti-inflammatories such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen. How's that sound to you?
Okay, that sounds good.
Um, and uh, you know, if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we can maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place, something prophylactic medicines.
Okay.
And we can have a discussion next time I see you next week, perhaps.
Okay.
Okay. Um, now one of the things I want you to think about is, you know, if your symptoms aren't getting any better in the next two, three days or indeed they're getting worse, I'd like you to come back and see me um straight away if possible. So if your headache's getting worse and not responding to medications or your um your neck pain is getting worse or you're developing any weakness in your arms and legs or your vision, then I want you to come back and see me straight away, okay?
Okay.
Does that sound all okay?
Doctor, that's great.
Great. Any questions for me?
No, thank you.
Okay. Have a good day.
Yeah, thanks. Bye.
