I see. Hello. Hi there. Hi, hi there. Uh, my name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors at Bablock. I just, can I confirm your name please? Hi, yeah. My name's. Sorry, would so your name was My name was Brian. Brian, hi Brian. Nice to meet you. Um, and your date of birth. Yeah, my date of birth is the 8th of August, 1982. Great. And, uh, are you in a sort of uh, confidential place where you can speak freely? Yeah, no, no one else can hear me. Great. And you're happy to continue with the consultation? Yes. Marvelous. Okay. So, um, how can I help today? Yeah, um, so basically it's just been happening over the last few weeks or so. But I don't really feel like, um, like getting up in the morning is really difficult, and I don't have much energy at all during the day. Um, often Yeah, just like doing most things that I would normally find easy, uh, is become quite difficult. Okay. So things have become quite difficult for you. Yeah. Is there anything else? Um, Oh, no, it's quite hard to say like things like I'm not not eating very much at the moment. I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy. Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. Um, so you've had difficulty waking up, no energy, not eating. That's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks, do you mean two or three or five, how long, roughly? Now I come to think about it, maybe maybe even longer. Um, I guess, uh, might be related to, so I also started a new job, um, slightly recently. Um, it might've even coincided coincided with uh with that job a couple of months ago. When did you start your new job, two months ago, did you say? Yeah. Okay. And um, so this has been going on perhaps for, um, sort of six weeks or so. More like two two months, I would say, yeah. Okay. All right. So, um, Is there anything that you're particularly sort of concerned about, um, or hoping to get out of this consultation? Well, um, I I know that it's not really normal for me. So, before this phase started happening, you know, I wouldn't have uh, any problems sort of eating what I want to eat, or, you know, doing standard things in life, and and what I want to do is to like kind of return to that previous state uh, somehow. Um, I'm not sure how that is, uh, what what the best ways of doing that are, but, yeah, give some advice or whatever. That'd be really useful. Okay. Sure. Okay. Um, well, what I'd like to do is just ask you a few more sort of questions around what's been going on, um, and also around your background health and, um, and things like that. And then we can go on to sort of what what can be done from there. Is that all right? Okay. Okay, great. So, you you say you've been um, feeling unwell with not a lot of energy, difficult waking up in the mornings. Do you tend to, just on that, do you tend to wake up early and then stay in bed in the mornings? Um, actually I'm just uh, not not really waking up early. It's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all, probably. I think that's probably closer. Difficulty sleeping as well. Yeah. And have you, and How how is your mood been over this period? Have you been Um, feeling usual straight? I I'd say. Uh, I I kind of, um, yeah, finding it really hard to quite difficult to focusing, I would say. Um, not unhappy or happy, but just uh quite not focused. Okay. Difficulty focusing, quite distracted. And would you say you've been been in good spirits or is your mood low? Um, actually, uh, now you you mention it, like my mood is a bit lower recently. Um, and so I know it's like, uh, my sex drive has kind of decreased, um, a bit over the the past few months as well. All right. So, yeah. Okay. And, um, so lower mood, decreased sex drive recently as well. And just on that note, just a few questions around that. Are you able to, uh, maybe slightly personal questions, but if you're okay to answer these. Do you tend to to have morning erections like you is that something that you've noticed recently? Um, I haven't noticed anything like that specifically. No. So, you've not so you're saying that you have not noticed morning erections and usually you would, so normal thing to have, uh, waking up in the mornings with something but you have not noticed those recently? I have not noticed those recently. Okay. So, and that's been a change, has it? Um, important one, I don't think. Um. Sorry? Yeah. No, I don't think it's an important change. No. I I, sorry, are you you don't think there's been a change there? No, there hasn't been a change there. Oh, okay, sorry. Right. So, okay. So, um, just going back to the mood symptoms as well. Uh, you say you've had, uh, difficulty focusing, easily distracted. Your mood has been, um, slightly lower with lower sex drive. Yeah. Um, and in what ways your sex drive been lower, are you in a relationship at the moment? Yeah, I I'm married. Um, I've been for for many years. And, uh, yeah, just, um, over the last few months just, uh, been disinterested. Disinterested. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, you phrased it for a moment. Um, so less interested as well. Okay. And just to ask you a few questions before we wrap up is, uh, any significant past medical history? Um, so do you suffer from any, uh, mental health problems in the past or any uh, physical health problems? No. Um, so in the past, um, I have uh, a history of hypothy thyroidism. Um, hypo Hypothyroidism. Hypo thyroid. Yeah. So that's Hi thyroid, just to sort of confirm that. Sorry, can you say that again please? Hyper, as in high, hyper thyroid. Hypo. Hypo. Okay. Hypo thyroid. Thank you. Thank you. Um, Yeah. And, uh, also in the past, I mean, I haven't had any kind of specific, uh, medical diagnosis along these lines. Um, but there's a suspicion that it may have had an impact on me, but my father has committed suicide, um, about 15 years ago. Okay. Okay. And, um, Uh, do you take any medications? I have a a drug history of Thyroxine. Mhm. So, maybe, yes. Do do you continue to take Thyroxine now? Yes. You do. You're So, you're taking Thyroxine at the moment. Um, Yes. Cool. Any drug allergies, are you allergic to any medications? No, I have no, uh, no medication allergies. No. No allergies. You mentioned the the suicide of your father 15 years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other, um, uh, significant family history of medical conditions or psychiatric conditions? No. No depression or anything like that running in the family or Nothing, nothing of that sort. Okay. And your mother is is well? Any brothers or sisters? Yeah, she's fine. Um, and I'm an only child. Um, Um, Okay. So, I just uh uh, sorry, might seem like a slightly random question, but any, uh, change in your vision? No, no, nothing like that. Change your vision. Okay. And just to go back to your you're saying you had low mood. Some people who are who do have low mood and low sex drive can sometimes feel uh, suicidal as well. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else? No. No. No, not really. No. And are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities that you have done in the past? Sometimes. I mean, I guess, um, most of the activities, but when I've been doing sports as well, um, I find sometimes it's quite difficult to breathe. Um, So I have sometimes like shortness of breath, um, when doing sports compared to maybe a couple of months ago. Okay. So, you you've become more short of breath over the last few months. Yeah. Um, and you've had, uh, Okay. So, uh, any other things around this, you're more fatigued, more shortness of breath, um, over the last few months. Um, with a low low mood, decreased sex drive. Um, is there just before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like to talk about? Um, No, nothing specific. No. So, um, getting a little bit towards the end now, but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you. Um, I would like to probably see you in person and do an examination and and also we'd probably like to do some blood tests, um, as well. So, do you think it would be possible to see to to book an appointment in the next few days, uh, with your GP or or, um, that would be ideal, I think here. Um, and then we can, we can probably do some more, uh, do an examination and and do some investigations really to see what's going on here a little bit more. That makes sense. Yeah. Is that all right? Yeah, that's very useful. Thank you. Um, Okay. Better to have some kind of plan. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think we I definitely think we need a plan here. Um, it's been nice talking to you. I'm sorry we've run out of time now. Uh, but we've at least started the ball rolling with um, some further investigations and tests. I'm glad that you're, you know, you're you're you're although you have a low mood, um, you're you're um, you're not feeling suicidal, just to confirm that. Um, and you're uh, and uh, we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some of your tiredness, um, and your other symptoms when we see you, okay? Thank you very much for taking the time. Okay. Thank you. Thanks.
