Hello. Hello? Hi, hi. Hi, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you well. Hi. My name's Dr. Gohill. I'm one of the doctors that works at Babylon. Can I? Hi doctor. My name is Can I check your name and date of birth, please? Yes, my my name is Roberto Mendoza. Okay. And uh, I'm, I was born on the first of January of, um, uh, 1992. Okay. And are you in a space that's quiet and you're able to talk? Oh, sorry. I, um, of 1990, sorry, I'm 48. Sorry, I forgot the So you're 48. And are you able to talk at the moment? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Tell me, it says here you have a you're, uh, you're having problems going to the toilet? Yes, so I have a I have a, I don't know how do you say it properly in English, uh, I mean without sounding vulgar like diarrhea. Okay. Yeah, so it's lasting for like three days. And uh, yeah, I I don't know, uh, I don't know what could cause it. Um, uh, I have a bit of pain, abdominal pain, and I had a bit of vomiting. And, uh, uh, Yeah. So this are kind of like the what is happening to me. Okay. Tell me how you were three days ago before this started. Did you have any medical problems? Uh, so I have, I have, I have asthma and I take some, uh, some, uh, uh, inhaler. Okay. I don't know, uh, I take an inhaler, um, and, um, I have an allergy, I have N N K D A allergy. Okay. So I don't know if it's because, I don't know. inhaler. Yeah. Okay. And apart from asthma, do you have anything else? Uh, I don't know, maybe it's because, you know, it's, this thing here in the stomach, this stuff. I, I always have in the back of my head that my father because he died about, um, 10 years ago of bowel cancer. Okay. So, yeah, this is kind of the the my my worries. I don't know if. Okay. So you've you've had the diarrhea for three days and now you're having tummy pain and vomiting. Yes, yes. Has the diarrhea been getting better or worse? Uh, uh, I I think it's not getting better or worse, it's kind of like, uh, uh, like either, like normal. Okay. Like it doesn't go away, it hasn't worsened. Okay. And how often do you go to the toilet? I go, I need to go, I, I can't go to work because I need to go like every, I don't know, it's this feeling like I go to the toilet and then when I finish, I need to, I feel I need to go again. Okay. And and uh, and yeah, so I need to be like close to the toilet. That must be hard. Yeah, yeah. Have you had to drink more water than normal? Uh, I don't know, maybe I'm not drinking enough water. Yeah. I drink, uh, I think I, yeah, I don't know. I, I think I don't drink enough water. An important question, have you noticed any blood? Uh, no, I haven't noticed any any blood. And you mentioned tummy pain. Can you tell me more about your tummy pain, like where it is and if it goes anywhere? So the pain is mainly, uh, focus in in the center area of the abdomen, like under the belly, under the belly button. And, uh, yeah, and sometimes I can hear my stomach like the cramps. Yeah. Have you been able to eat and drink? Uh, yes, but, yes, but I, I go to the toilet so often, so I, I I, yeah, I try not to eat a lot because I, yeah, I just keep going to the toilet every 10 minutes. And you said the tummy pain's in the middle of your tummy. Does it go anywhere else? No, no, just there. And it, it seems to be alleviate a bit toilet and maybe it's like trapped gas, I don't know what it is, but Okay. And when was the last time you vomited? I think it was this morning. This morning. I but the thing is like because I'm not eating anything now. So I, I haven't vomited again. Did you have any breakfast? I I don't know. I didn't. Uh, no, sorry, yes, I did actually. I did. I had some fruit. I had some fruit. Okay. And that, and you vomited that up afterwards? And afterwards I didn't have anything, then I got a bit of nausea and I vomited, and then and uh, yeah, that was it. That was it and I haven't eaten since then. So now I'm, I think I'm okay, but, uh, Yeah, and I don't, yeah. Did you notice any blood when you vomited? Um, I think I do. I think I do, but it's, uh, no, no, actually I can't say, sorry, I'm sorry. I, I, I don't think there is blood because, uh, yeah, it was, it was strawberries that I was having for breakfast. So, so yeah, it wasn't blood. Okay. And, um, three days ago, did you eat anything that you think might have been bad or anything that could have caused the tummy pain? Uh, I, I don't know. To be honest, sometimes I have, when I get a bit of anxiety, I, I use my inhaler. Yeah. And but my inhaler kind of, um, ran out, the one, because you know, I'm a foreigner. So I have this brand, but I bought a new one here. Okay. And, uh, I don't know, maybe if this new one has caused it. Okay. This problem, I don't know. Okay. It's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain like this. Normally it's when you eat, um, bad food or food that has gone off and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested. But just to double check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing? Uh, uh, uh, I always have problems with my breathing because of the asthma, like when I ex, I need to use my inhaler a little bit, but apart of the normal, I haven't, I haven't. Okay. And how about chest? Have you noticed any chest pain? Um, no, I haven't, I haven't noticed any chest pain. Okay. And how about, um, walking and talking, are those all both okay? Uh, walking and talking, uh, yeah, yes. Uh, I, I but, uh, but yeah, I don't walk very far because I, yeah, I need to, I need to go to the toilet now and then so I'm spending some time at home. And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain? Oh, it does a little bit. Okay. Sorry, I was just writing some things down. Sure. So what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad and it's causing your tummy pain. Okay. And it's no, this is normally called gastroenteritis, so an infection of the tummy. Oh, okay. Normally when patients have this, we ask you to do certain things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids because you're losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers, so if you start getting a temperature, then you need to talk to a GP or a pharmacist or take Paracetamol. Uh, huh. And three is stay home for the time being until you get slightly better. Okay. And normally Okay. I Yeah. Normally things like antibiotics don't help, they make the situation worse. Okay. So that's I didn't Yeah. Go ahead. Sorry, I didn't. No, I was saying I didn't have any fever recently. I, I was sweating a little bit last for bed, but I, I not sure if if I had a bit of fever but very little or, but I don't think so. I don't think. I don't know, maybe. So I think that's what we should do for the time being. If you feel you're getting much worse, then I would suggest you go and see your GP in real, in real life, in person. So they can look at your belly. Okay, I will, yeah, I will book then, I will book, I will wait a couple of days to see or one more day and then I will book. Okay. Yeah. Cool. Do you have any more questions for me? Uh, no, that's, that's it. I was maybe just concerned about my father's medical history that would, Yeah. It would have some kind of risk. So the, the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy, and less likely to be something your father had. But Okay. If your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look up from the GP. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah, that sounds good. That sounds good. Thank you. Thank you very much, doctor, for your time. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
