Not too bad. Uh any cough, wheeze? Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy as well, and there's coffee coughing, yeah. Slight cough, yeah. Yeah. Sore throat, runny nose, sore eyes? You know, I had a cold last week and it's not as bad as it was but yeah I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose, I was just feeling under the weather. You feeling better now or on the tight chest? I mean, I feel worse but the runny nose isn't as bad anymore. Right. Okay. Okay, but you know, now you've got this this and so you've still got still got uh symptoms of a cold essentially. Yeah, the cough kind of stuck around. Uh, yeah, okay. Are you coughing up anything? Uh, no. And um, do you have any other medical problems like asthma? Yeah, yeah, I have asthma. I've had it for a while now. Um, And then I have like a hay fever. You know, just some allergies to dust, and stuff like that. Okay. Do you have any inhalers or any any medications? Um, yeah, so uh, you know, the um, uh, Ventolin It's called uh, Salbutamol. Yeah. I got that one and then I have a steroid, uh, Clenil, Clenil inhaler. Clenil Modulite, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And um, Uh, have you been using Clenil and Ventolin and how often have you been using them? Um, well, to be honest, I was away at Uni last week and I forgot to bring it with me, so I haven't really in the past week. Both of them? Because because um, sorry, they ran out and I I forgot to go and grab the next one. Yeah, sure. about a week ago. Okay. All right. All right. So so so you you haven't got any Clenil or any Ventolin at the moment. Not with me right now. No, I ran out. Okay. All right. Um, and uh any drug allergies you know of? No. No allergies to anything. Just like just the dust and stuff but nothing no drugs. Okay, great. Now, uh, do you anyone in your family had any medical problems you know of? Um, yeah, my mom has eczema and my dad has asthma. Uh, oh, when I was young, I also had eczema and I had a milk protein allergy when I was young, too. Okay. Um, Right. So, just uh, do you have any other sort of concerns or ideas about what might be going on or um, hopes for this consultation? Um, Not really. Like I feel like asthma's probably a part of it and probably getting my inhalers would be helpful. Um, It's just kind of scary because I haven't had a time like this where I've been so tight uh, in a long time. Yeah, absolutely. I can, I can imagine. Um, well, it's certainly sounds like uh, you've you've had this cold, you've got wheezy with a cough, um, and it's non-productive cough and you're short of breath. Uh, is the cough worse at nighttime? I mean, it gets a little bit worse at night, but basically just pretty consistent. Yeah. It hasn't gone away. Okay. And you've got this tight tight chest. But you you said you've got chest pain, it's more of a tight chest, is it? No, not really pain. It's more like tight. It just feels like sometimes you can't get a full breath in, you know? Yeah, sure. Um, okay. Well, I I would quite like to uh, certainly get you some uh, Ventolin, Clenil Modulite. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past? Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit more like back in high school. Um, but I've been pretty good at taking my my inhalers, so not not so much anymore. Have you ever been to hospital uh, as an in-patient? As in, you know, stayed in there overnight for asthma? Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat. Oh, okay. So, so, so you, uh, you ha you went to hospital and had a, uh, so you stayed in hospital for a few days, did you with an asthma exacerbation? Yeah, I did, yeah. Okay. But currently, you're just on Ventolin and Clenil and you haven't got any of those steroids. those inhalers at the moment. I've been pretty good, I've been pretty good just on the Clenil and the Salbutamol. Okay. When sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation? Uh, I think I was like 17. Sixteen maybe? Sure. Okay. Um, Just to quantify how short of breath you are, um, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you. No, you won't have, will you? Yeah. Um. Are you able to like walk up flight of stairs okay? Walk on the flat okay? Without getting too short of breath or um are you short of breath at rest? Uh, I'm definitely not short of breath at rest. Like except for that feeling I was describing. It does when I'm walking upstairs I do feel like I have a little bit more short of breath than I would normally be. Sure. Yeah, okay. But you're not short of breath at rest at the moment. Oh, no, no, I'm not. Okay, fine. So, what I what I think, um, and just just go over. Is there anything you'd hoped about getting other than the, uh, a prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else that you'd hoped about getting from this? I just want to know that I'm okay to just like keep I just don't want to have to get um, that that intubation again. Sure. Yeah. No. Absolutely. Okay. Well, I'm really glad you've talked to me today. I think what we can do is is give you a prescription for, uh, some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you within the hour, I would hope. Um, and, uh, I think what the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a dose of steroids. So, this is these are tablets which, um, you can take for five days. Uh, two tablets in the morning. And, uh, that should just dampen down your asthmatic response, okay? Okay. Um, now, there are some side effects to the steroids which I should really tell you about but please read the label. It's associated with Don't be too worried about the side effects. They're uncom most, you know, most of the time the steroids are very well tolerated. And, uh, you pro do have you had them in the past, do you know of? Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying? Have you had steroids in the past? Um, I can't remember. Probably. Probably. Yeah. I was. So, um, they they can come, they can make you your mood change, can be slightly low or slightly high. Can give you a high blood sugar. Um, and, uh, they, uh, they can also cause nausea, um, headaches but mostly it's well tolerated and it should help your asthma an awful lot. Um, Okay. Uh, what I'd like to do is is send you these the some prescriptions for your uh, inhalers are ongoing. So, um, you can once you get better from this asthma attack, you can you can use the Clenil Modulite in the morning with Ventolin as a PRN, but so Ventolin when you need to, um, when you're getting wheezy. If you should start to use the Ventolin more than uh, every three hours, uh, uh, at any time, it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So, um, see a doctor, um, in some capacity. Uh, and the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer which would allow the medication to actually go into your lungs better. Have you, do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before? Yeah, yeah. Someone taught me how to use it a while ago. I don't, I don't really use it. To be honest, but Have you got one? I think I do. I have one somewhere. Okay. All right. Well, um, I'll send you another one and it has some instructions about how to use it but essentially, uh, a couple of puffs to prime it inside, breathing in and out, um, uh, for five or five or ten breaths. Okay. Uh, yeah. So, Uh, was there anything else that was on your mind or you're concerned about at this stage? I think you got me covered. Okay. Um, and, uh, I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify for seven days, but, uh, I think I would advise you just to rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're okay with that. Thanks. All right. All right. Well, thank you very much. No worries. Any deterioration in symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath, um, or just generally concerning symptoms, uh, pain in your chest, tightness, uh, feeling lightheaded, uh, then seek further medical attention anytime please. Okay? All right, sounds good. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.
