No, but then, um, my, um, my brother, um, has actually been having similar symptoms, um, for the past, um, few days as well. And he does stay, like everyone in school's got it. So, I I don't know, that might that might be from him. So, you've been in contact with him, have you? Yes. Okay. Um, and any other medical problems? None that I'm aware of. Have you had any other symptoms at the moment like rash? No, no rash. No, nothing like that. Okay. Um, any surgery before or abdominal problems or any other medical issues? Well, apart from the fact that this one is giving me abdominal pains, no previous abdominal pains before. Honestly, I get the odd, um, you know, menstrual cramps and all that, but, you know, that's, you know, that comes and goes. Okay. And whereabouts is the pain that you're getting? Um, it's kind of like towards my navel area. Like, I can't touch my navel area. It's just so sore. And it gets, yeah, towards like the center of my navel. Um, and does the pain come and go? Yes, it does come. When it comes, I feel the strong urge to go to the to the loo and then it sort of releases me and sort of like comes again, it comes and goes. Okay.

And who do you live with at home? I live with my brother and my mom. Okay. And um, have you tried anything yourself for this problem? Well, I've tried a home remedy. Um, I've tried the the ORS you know, thing about from my my local my local um. Um. Can you just repeat that? The ORS, the the salt sugar ORS um um mix. The salt sugar mix. Okay. And how often have you been taking that? I've taken that, I've taken that like um three times a day for the past two days. Okay. Um, and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off or getting worse or To be honest, I I they're not getting any better because like I said, I've been I've been vomiting literally everything I take. So so I doubt that even that has had a chance to work. Okay. Um, I mean, it sounds like because your brother's had a similar thing, it sounds like it might be some an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got, which is usually caused by a virus but it can be from something you've eaten as well. Um, if the symptoms, they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts. Um, if the symptoms are continuing to get worse, the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough. Um, sometimes you do require certain medication to help this, if it's sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria. Um, what I would say is probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not starting to ease off, I think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment. Okay. Um, and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated because if you're if you're not keeping fluid down, then you can get dehydrated. Um, how do I how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even like drink water? I'm throwing up everything. Yeah. So you need to carry on with your rehydration salts and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago. So you're obviously still um hydrated enough to pass urine. But we um, we should see you so that we can check your hydration and um get that sample sent off as soon as possible. Because if if if you come into the clinic, you can send that sample off straight away, otherwise we would have to post it out to you, which would take time. Oh, okay. So, when can I come to the clinic to have this done? Um, so we can, we can make you an urgent appointment. Um, and then you can you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration. Um, but if in the meantime, you're feeling more unwell, then we would get you seen urgently in A and E. Okay. So you could call us back in the meantime. Okay. So what I'll do, yeah, if you could please book me the appointment and then, yeah, I'll see how I feel, um, before the end of the day. Hopefully, I don't need to go to A and E and I'll keep going with the rehydration salts just tiny sips constantly to so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and and you vomit. So just tiny tiny sips but just keep going with it. Um, and just have very simple food if you're going to have anything like toast or biscuit or something really light like that. Avoid um, fruit, vegetables, um, milk, anything like that which might just make it worse. Okay. Okay. So you're happy to book an appointment through the support line? Yes, please. Right. Okay, we'll do that for you. Fine. Okay. Take care. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.
