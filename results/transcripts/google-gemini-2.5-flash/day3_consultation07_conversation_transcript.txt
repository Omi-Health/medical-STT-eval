Okay. Have you ever used steroids in the past for your eczema?
Um, I I'm not sure, uh, Ah, yes, yes, I've Yes, I've used it.
You've used steroids in the past. Yeah, but it it's not helping.
Yeah. Oh, so you're still using the steroids?
Yeah, I tried, I tried.

I'm not sure. It's, uh, Hydro Hydrocortisone. Is it your Hydrocortisone?
Is not there.
Okay. So, is it like the over-the-counter ones?
Sorry?
Over the counter. Hydrocortisone. That does that ring a bell? Yeah. So you're using the hydrocortisone, yeah?
Are you using any antihistamines at all?
Uh, No. No. No antihistamines. Okay. Right. Fine. Otherwise, other than the rash, you're feeling well in yourself. There's no temperature, no joint pains, yeah?
No joint pain. But I will add I've tried those antihistamines and it didn't work.
You've tried the antihistamines and didn't work. Okay, which one did you try?
The one over the counter.
Okay, so like Cetirizine, yeah? Yeah. Okay. That's fine. Right. Okay, so from what you're describing, it looks like, you know, it is quite widespread your eczema. Yeah? Because you're having it all over your chest and hands and things like that. Um, So, do you have any allergies to any medication at all?
No, no allergies.
No allergies. Okay. And you don't other than eczema, you don't have any other medical condition?
I I have, uh, asthma, and, uh, in my family, uh, there is, uh, hypothyroidism and migraine. My mother has migraine.
Mother has migraine, and what was the other one? I didn't understand.
Hypothyroid.
Hypo Who has hypothyroidism?
My mother.
Okay. So she has hypothyroidism. Okay. That's fine. Right, you. You mentioned you have asthma. So what medications are you using for asthma?
Um, uh, you know, probably inhaler.
The blue inhaler. So you don't you don't use it every day. So you just use it on and off, yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. Blue inhalers. But your breathing is all okay, yeah?
Okay, yeah. Yeah, it's only it's only when I have a flare, I use it.
Sure. So, what we need to do is obviously you've got extens as I've mentioned. So extensive eczema. What we'll do is you need a couple of things because to keep you a bit comfortable, we'll you would probably need some antihistamines, which I'm going to prescribe. Also, hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you use for young children. You might probably need a bit more stronger one like Betnovate or something like that. Okay? So we'll try that first. So I'm going to give it's called the antihistamine is called Fexofenadine, and then we'll try with some Betnovate first. So it's like very small amount, like it's like one fingertip, yeah? This much is is enough to cover your palms and your back of your hands, yeah? So it's very small amount. So that if you can imagine, you can cover with a very small amount the whole body. Yeah? So use that. You you have to use it twice a day for the next couple of weeks. Okay? If if there's no improvement, you need to get back to us or if you have any kind of adverse reaction like an allergic reaction, which is unlikely, but if it still happens, you need to get in touch with us. Okay?
Okay. Thank you very much. So, what we're going to do is we are going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy. It looks like Boots on the system. Is that correct?
Yes. Yes.
Yes. So, I'll send it across to Boots. It will be there for collecting. If things are getting worse in the next two weeks, call us beforehand. Otherwise, wait for two weeks, take the medication and the cream. You still need to continue on your emollients, like the Dermo soap and as well as the Diprobase. Yeah. So you still need to use those in the interim. Any questions at all?
No, no questions. Thank you.
Excellent. You take care then. Bye-bye now.
Thank you. Bye. Bye.
