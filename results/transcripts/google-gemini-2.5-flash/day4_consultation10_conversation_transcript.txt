Um, but there could be a few other things going on. I would quite like to, uh, see you to do some further, to do an examination and to do some some tests as well. Um, we need to definitely rule out pregnancy with you and possibly, um, do some other examinations or or sort of further tests. So, would you be happy to actually see a GP face-to-face, um, soon? Today, ideally. Yes, yeah. Sure, I can make time. Are you and you're feeling hot hot and sweaty. Have you been feeling, um, lightheaded at all or like you're going to faint? No, no, not like I'm going to faint. Okay. All right.

If in the meantime between now and and me or or a GP seeing you, you feel worse in any way, you get lightheaded, um, you, uh, you have you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you, um, then I think to take them quite seriously and and see somebody more urgently if possible.
