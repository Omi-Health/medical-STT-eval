Yeah, so I can send a prescription through to your requested pharmacy for that. If you take them as soon as you can, get them, pick them up as soon as you can and start taking them. The other thing which is important to do is to drink lots of water, so two and a half to three liters a day. Um, you can get some cranberry juice and take drink that as well, that sometimes helps and also some sachets um, which you can get from the chemist, some sachets which just help change the acidity of your urine. So I I can put the details of that on your notes.
Okay then.
Um, if you feel like your pain is getting worse or not settling, you get lower back pain, um, or you're getting a high temperature, or you have any problems actually passing urine, then it's very important that we speak to you again.
Okay.
Um the other thing is if it becomes a common thing or a recurrent problem then we need to talk to you again about it.
So do I have to call after I finish my course of antibiotics?
No, not if you're better. Okay. If you're if you feel like your symptoms get worse at any point, or they're not resolving with the treatment, or you keep getting a similar um, you keep getting a similar problem recurrently, then it's important for us to talk talk to you more detail about that.
Okay then.
Um have you got any other questions?
Uh, no. Well, what would be the pharmacy I'll be picking up my medication from?
Um, so have you already requested a pharmacy through Babylon?
Yes, I did.
Can I just check that with you?
Knightsbridge practice.
Okay, that's fine. So the antibiotics that I'm going to prescribe um will go through to that pharmacy. And then You'll be able to pick them up from there.
How soon is that going to be at the practice in five minutes?
