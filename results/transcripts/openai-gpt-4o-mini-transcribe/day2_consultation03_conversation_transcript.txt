Hello. Hi there. Good morning. Hi. I'm Dr. Dinmi from Google Care. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Hello. Hi. So before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth? That's okay. Yes. Mary Richards. I'm 40 years old. So... Okay, fine. So you're 40 years old, you said, yeah? Perfect. Okay. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak at the moment? Yeah. Okay, great. So how can I help you today? So I've just been having some problems with my hearing. I can't really hear very well. And I noticed that my face has been feeling a bit numb recently. Right. Okay. Okay. And how long has this been going on for? It's been a few weeks now. About three weeks or something. Right. Okay. And is this just on one side or both sides? Just one side. Just on my left side. I've noticed that the hearing side has gone down a bit. Right. Okay. And your face feeling numb, where exactly is that? Which part of your face? Can you show me with your finger? Yes. Again, it's the left side. It's kind of like around my left ear and kind of along here. So like my jawline is just all feeling a bit numb around here. Right. Okay. Okay. Has anything else happened in this time? Any other symptoms you've had at all? Not that I've noticed. Occasionally noticed that ringing in my ear. Ringing in your ear. Okay. Yeah. Part of it. Sure. Okay. And have you had any weakness or numbness in the rest of the body at all? No, no, no, no. Nothing like that. Okay. Have you had any difficulty swallowing? No. And have you had any difficulty speaking? No, no. Have you noticed any problems with your vision at all? No, that's all good. Okay. And do you have the numbness present right now? Yeah, it's kind of there quite often. So four times. So yeah, right now it feels very, it doesn't feel like when I touch this side of my face. Sure, sure. Okay. All right. Just going back to the kind of muffled hearing feeling in the ear. Do you have any discharge coming from that ear at all? No, nothing coming out. Any pain in the ear or from the ear? No. Right, okay. And have you had any fever at all? No, nothing like that. And do you have any itchiness in the ear? No. Do you use coconut buds to kind of pump your ears out? I don't, no, no, no. Okay. All right. Do you need to ask a few other general questions? Do you have any other illnesses at all? Well, I've kind of been told I had polyps in my nose in the past. And occasionally get some kind of half-earnings feeling. That's all fine. And, you know, I take a Reni if I need to. And if my polyps are playing up, I've got a spray. Other than that, I think they said ages ago I had something called, I can't remember, labyrinthitis, something like that. But again, nothing on. Sure, okay. So are you on any regular medication? You mentioned the spray for your nose. Yeah, so no, I only take the spray for my nose when I need it for, and sometimes take over like Reni, but I just get that from the chemist. Sure. And the spray for your nose, where do you get that from? Is that from a doctor? Yeah, they gave me a prescription ages ago. Yeah. Do you remember the name of the spray at all? Unfortunately, I don't, sorry. That's all right. And you're not on any other medication at all? No. No, okay. Do you have any allergies to any medication? No, just latex. Latex, okay. All right, that's good to know. And in terms of your family, are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all? My brother had neurofibromatosis, I think it is. Right. Other than that, everyone else is okay. Okay, good. That's good to hear. And in terms of your own kind of background now, are you working at the moment? Yeah, so I'm a jockey, but because of all the kind of symptoms I've been getting, especially sometimes when I get a ringing, I can feel a bit dizzy. I've just had to do far less training. So kind of beginning to, yeah, impacting work a little bit now. Okay, so you have to explain this. Jockey like with horses, is that what you're talking about? Yeah. All right, okay, fine. Great. And do you live alone? I live with my partner. Oh, okay, right. Do you have any pets at all at home? No, no pets. Okay, fine. Fantastic. All right. Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what's been going on recently? No, just like I said, like the ringing occasionally. And when I get that, I can sometimes feel a bit dizzy. But the main thing is really the lack of hearing and the numbness that's got me a bit like, yeah, no idea what's going on there. Okay, fine. All right. So what I think, go on. There was one thing I think that, because I can panic and you can look online and get a bit frantic. I guess what I'm trying to think is, you know, is there something particularly serious that, you know, will need to be sorted? And obviously really anything, because maybe really frantic. And is it hopefully nothing so serious I would die from it? I don't know. I just, I think. Okay. Obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via video portal. But from what you've told me, this doesn't seem to be anything that you're going to die from. However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today. Okay. I would like you to come into one of my clinics. I'd like a GP to assess you. What you're describing might be something called Bell's palsy. Yeah. We can go into that explaining what that is if that's confirmed on physical examination. That's not usually a life-threatening problem. But part of the reason why I'd like you to come in is just that we can do what we call a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on. And confirm that that might be the diagnosis. Have a look inside the ear, see if there's anything to see within the ear. So in answer to your question, no, I don't think that you need to worry about that. I think, you know, preliminarily I can reassure you. However, in order to definitively reassure you, I think you need a physical examination today. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to send a message to our admin team. I'll ask them to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics within central London. Okay. And then you can ring the support team number. I'll leave that number in your notes. You can ring them after five minutes and they'll slot you into a place that's convenient for you. Okay. That's fine. So someone will see you and hopefully we'll be able to reassure you further. But please make sure the appointment gets done today. Okay. Yeah, they will do. That's fine. Thank you very much. All right, then. Okay. Nice to see you. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye.
