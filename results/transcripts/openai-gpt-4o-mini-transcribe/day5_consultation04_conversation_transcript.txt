And any weight loss or blood in the stool or urine? Yes, I have, as I said, I have some, I can see some discharge and bleeding, but then I do, other than that, there is no other discharge. Fine. I think with the abdominal pain, as it's getting worse and it's been going on for the last few days, it would be very helpful to be able to examine you properly. Would you be happy to have an examination with a doctor? Yes. Okay. So what we can do is we can arrange a face-to-face examination where they can see you in a clinic and do an abdominal examination and advise further from them when we've got more of an idea what's causing the problem. Would you be happy to call the support line and arrange that appointment? Yes. Okay, that's fine. So we'll do that. In the meantime, if it gets a lot worse or you're not holding any fluids down, then we should see you before then. Did you say your pregnancy test was a month ago? Yes. Okay. And your implant on was just put in a year ago? Yes. The other thing we would need to do is to do a pregnancy test today if possible. I would do it. So if you can do that today and if it's positive, we need to see you straight away. So give us a call back. Yes. Okay. Have you got any other questions? No, that's it. Right. Okay. So if you call the support line and make an appointment, we'll go from there. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.
