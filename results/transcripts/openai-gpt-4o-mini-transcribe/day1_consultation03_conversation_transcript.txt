Hello. Hello. Hello there. It's Dr. C here. How can I help you this afternoon? Oh, I've just got a terrible headache since midday. On the left side. It's just making me feel so ill. I just feel like I need to vomit. Sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about the headache? Well, you know, I noticed some zigzag lines in my vision a few minutes before the headache started. My vision blurred. You know, it's just... Yeah, pain's just horrible. It's making me feel so unwell. Okay. I'm just really worried. I've just been googling and I've read, you know, if your headache gets worse when you move, it could be a sign of brain cancer. Okay. Is that what you're worried about? Is that what your main worry is today? Oh, yeah, yeah. And I've like, you know, my friend's mum, she recently died of a brain tumour. So it's really concerning me actually. Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that. I can understand why it's affecting you. But why don't we take a good history first and let me examine you and then we can have a little chat afterwards and see what's going on here. So you mentioned a few things. You mentioned headaches. You also mentioned some zigzag lines before the headaches came on. And your vision has been blurry as well. Is that right? Is that on both eyes or just left eye? It feels like it's on both. Both eyes, okay. Have you had any difficulty with seeing bright lights at all? Yeah, well, I'm wearing sunglasses right now. Because just, you know, light's really hurting my eyes. Oh, I see. Okay. And you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous. Have you vomited at all? Yeah, I vomited twice. Twice, okay. Earlier today, okay. Any temperatures or fevers? No, I don't feel feverish. Okay. Any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed? No, I haven't noticed anything like that. Okay. Fine. And do you normally get headaches? Not really prone to them, no. No, but I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago. Okay. And what happened then? Just similar. How long did it last for? A couple of days. Did you do anything that made it better? Yeah, I had to take painkillers and had to sort of go to bed and rest. And a couple of days off work and I work in the fashion industry and, you know, they're wondering what's going on, like I had to take sick days. I mean, I'm back to work today, but, you know, what if it is a brain tumour? What's going to happen with my future and my career? You know, I'm really worried about this. Never had headaches like this before. Like, why should I get them now? Yeah, sure. And I can see your concerns. Obviously, there's a lot of worry there. But, you know, let's take it step by step and see exactly what the cause of these headaches are first. I'm just going to ask you some very yes-no questions, if that's okay. Have you noticed any problems with your speech at all? Any difficulty with your words? No. Any problems with your arms and legs, for example, numbness or weakness? No. Any difficulty with your balance or coordination? No. Okay. And have you had any injuries to your head? Have you had a fall recently or been knocked on the head? No. Okay. All right. And you're feeling otherwise okay? So, for example, your breathing is okay. You're not feeling breathless or... No. Okay. Do you have any other medical history I should be aware of? No. So, for example, has anyone told you you've had migraines in the past? No. Okay. My mum has migraines, but I've not been diagnosed. Right. So my next question was about family history. Is there anything in the family? So apart from migraines, is there anything else, anything related to the brain, for example? Migraines as well. What was that, sorry? My mum has an underactive thyroid as well. Underactive thyroid as well. Okay. Any other problems, for example, with the brain? Or you mentioned brain cancer. Any other family history of that? No. No. Okay. In terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis? I take the pill, microgynon. Okay. And how long have you been on that for? Three months. Three months. Okay. And is that mainly for contraception or is that for something else? It's for contraception. Okay. All right. That's something we may need to have a little discussion about today as well. My next question was about your social, really, your situation at home. You mentioned you work in a fashion industry. Is your job quite stressful at the moment? Yeah, it's really stressful, actually. I'm having problems with people at work, you know, managers putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver. Yeah, it's not a good time. Is it getting you down? I don't feel down, just feel a bit stressed. Okay. All right. And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress normally? Nothing, really. Okay. Do you do much in the way of exercise? No. No. Okay. Who's at home with you? I live on my own. Okay. Are you coping okay at the moment? Fine. Yeah. Okay. Do you smoke at all? No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol? No. Okay. All right. So normally, like I said, I'd kind of proceed to examination. But based on your story, I wonder whether you may have a migraine, a migraine-type headache. It sounds very classical of that nature, the headache on one side, throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to bright lights. I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious such as meningitis or indeed brain cancer. I know that was a big worry of yours initially. Thank you. Thanks so much. I was so worried that I had cancer and now you say migraine. Yeah, I guess my mum had similar symptoms to me. Yeah. It does make sense. Well, I hope that puts you at minor ease. Certainly, this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month. So I think moving forward, there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important to see exactly what's triggering these headaches. But we should also try and treat your headaches today. Some strong painkillers would be advisable. So think about paracetamol or even cocodamol and some anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen and naproxen. How does that sound to you? Okay, that sounds good. And if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we can maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place. Something prophylactic medicines. Okay. We can have a discussion next time I see you next week, perhaps. Okay. Okay. Now, a couple of things I want you to think about is if your symptoms aren't getting better in the next two, three days or indeed are getting worse, I'd like you to come back and see me straight away if possible. So if your headache is getting worse and not responding to medications or your neck pain is getting worse or you're developing weakness in your arms and legs or your vision, then I want you to come back and see me straight away. Okay. Okay. Does that sound all okay? Doctor, that's great. Great. Any questions for me? No, thank you. Okay, have a good day. Okay, thanks. Bye.
