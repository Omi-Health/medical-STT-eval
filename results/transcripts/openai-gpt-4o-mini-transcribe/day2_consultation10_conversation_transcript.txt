Hello, good afternoon. Hiya. Hi there, this is Dr. Jean Meza from GP at Hand. Hi there, my name's Aiton. Hi Aiton. So before we start, can I have your full name and date of birth if that's possible? Sure, so it's Aiton Warren and my date of birth is the 16th of May 1982. That's great, thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're okay to speak? I am, yes. Okay, great. So how can I help you today? So I kind of woke up this morning and I've just got this really horrible pain on the left side of my head. A real kind of headache-y feeling. Sure, okay. And did the pain wake you up? Yeah, it woke me up quite early this morning. What time did it wake you up? Probably around 5.30ish. And what time do you normally get up? I normally get up at about 7 o'clock. Is the headache still present now? Yes, it is. Okay. Have you had this kind of pain before? I mean, I've had a bit of a history with headaches, but nothing as severe as this before. So they were less severe. Were they similar in nature in terms of being one-sided and the type of pain? Not so much on the one-sided. It tends to be a bit of a cluster at the front of my head in a way. But this time it's just kind of more prominent on the left side, which I've never really had. Normally they kind of spread across the front of my head. Okay, all right. And can I just double check, do you have any neck stiffness at all? No. Okay. And do you have any fever? No. All right. How are you with bright lights at the moment? Do you feel sensitive to bright lights or can you tolerate them? I'm a little bit sensitive. It just kind of makes my eyes a little bit sore, but nothing that I can't really handle. Okay. And can I just double check, are you feeling nauseous at all? Not really. When I first got up this morning, my head felt a bit dizzy, but that's kind of subsided now and it seems to be fine. Okay. And can I just double check, does anyone in your family have any migraines or anything like that? Have they been diagnosed with migraines? No, they haven't. Okay. And are you under any particular stress at the moment? Work's kind of a bit stressful at the moment. I've got a lot going on. Yeah, I just seem to have like a lot of kind of a backlog of work that I need to go through at the moment. So I've kind of been doing a lot of late nights as well. Right, okay. And how long has that been the case for? Probably about a couple of months now. How would you say your mood is? I'm not like moody, I'm not angry or I get a bit frustrated during the day, but it kind of ebbs and flows every now and then. But yeah. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression or stress in the past? I've had, so I had like anxiety for about two years now and I've been on sertraline for a while. Okay. Are you taking sertraline at the moment? Yes. Okay. And how do you feel in terms of anxiety at the moment? Do you feel anxious at the moment? No, not necessarily at work. Sometimes I do feel a bit anxious, but I kind of just, the panic of not being able to get my work done on time. But other than that, I don't feel massively anxious. All right. Now, sorry, I just need to ask this for anyone suffering from anxiety. Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself? No. Good. Right. Now, with regards to this headache, is it worse when you lie down or is it better when you lie down? When I lay down, like it kind of feels a little bit sore at first and it takes me a while to get comfortable. So, yeah, at the beginning it does, but then again, that just kind of soothes a little bit. Okay. So, would you say ultimately it's better when you lie down? Yeah, I would say so. Okay. And in terms of this headache since this morning, have you taken anything for it yet? I've taken some paracetamol. Does that help? Not really, no. Okay. Have you taken anything else at all? No, that's it, just paracetamol. Okay. Do you have any other illnesses at all? None. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure? No. Have you ever had your blood pressure checked? No. Okay. And are there any illnesses in your family? No, there's nothing. My parents, my mum's had a history of anxiety as well, but no kind of like physical illnesses or anything like that. Okay. All right. And are you on any medication? No, other than sertraline and having taken paracetamol this morning, nothing else. Do you have any allergies to any medication? Not that I'm aware of, no. All right. And are you living by yourself at the moment or are you living with someone else? I live with my partner. Okay. Are you a smoker? No. Okay. And do you have any pets at home? I have a cat. Okay. And can I just double check, how much exercise would you do normally a week? So normally I try to go running at least three times a week. Okay. And what's your diet like? It's okay. It's nothing really healthy, but it's fine. Okay. I wouldn't say it's unhealthy. All right. Now in terms of this headache, obviously I haven't been able to examine you or see you directly, but it sounds like it might be one of two things. It could be an element of what we call tension headache. Okay. That's one possibility. And what makes that more likely is the fact that you've been under some pressure and you have a history of anxiety in the past. Okay. The other possibility is migraine as well. Okay. And the fact, what makes that more likely is the fact that it's on one side and that you've got some sensitivity to light. Okay. So what I think we can do is I think we can give you some generic pain relief that would be the appropriate first step for migraine type headaches. Okay. So I'll tell you what it is in a second. And the other thing that I was going to suggest is we maybe look, explore things to try and decrease the stress from work. So the medication wise, the things that we start off first line if someone had migraine would be to start ibuprofen and the doses of ibuprofen can be a bit more than the normal doses of ibuprofen. So that's one thing we can start. You can keep on taking paracetamol as well if you like, but the ibuprofen is actually more effective for migraine. And yeah, so the guidelines have changed recently. Before that we used to give paracetamol as first line, but now it's ibuprofen and aspirin. That's the first thing. The other thing I'd like to do is maybe consider taking some time off work. Okay. Because if that's due to stress from work, maybe having a week off, if you self-certify, that might help with things. And I'd also like you to explore counseling options as well. So there's a counseling service in your area that I can give you the link for, for you to self-refer. Yeah, that'd be great. Okay, let's try that. What we're going to do is we'll have a follow-up in a week's time. As well as those two things, other things I'd like you to do is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of seven or eight hours sleep at night, every night. Okay. A minimum of 1.5 to 2 liters of water or fluids a day. And that's not including coffee or tea. Okay. All right. Because sometimes dehydration and fatigue can be causes of headaches as well. Oh, I didn't realize that. Yeah, so that is, you know, we need to rule those things out. Let's try that. Okay. Let's have a follow-up appointment. If we're finding that things are not getting better, we might need to arrange some blood tests or look at other possibilities. But we'll try that in the first instance. If anything changes in the meantime, or you get worried or things get worse, feel free, have a low threshold for ringing us back and booking an appointment and we can reassess the situation. Okay. Yeah, that sounds brilliant. Thank you so much for your help. Okay, no problem. So there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes. And I'll also leave a link to some of the danger signs and symptoms of headaches in the notes. If you can read through that in your own time, that'll just help you to have a bit more control over what's going on and understanding of what kind of things should trigger you contacting another doctor. Okay, that's perfect. Thank you so much for your help. No problem. Okay, so we'll touch base in a week's time with myself or one of the other doctors and we'll take it from there, okay? Okay, thank you. Yeah, I'll book an appointment in that time. Brilliant. Okay, take care then. Thank you, Andrew. Bye-bye. Bye.
